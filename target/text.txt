A true player shines through!
Soccer is everything to me!
Witness our will to win!

If they take it, we just take it back!
Stay sharp, everyone!
Don't give up yet!
Nice work!

That was amazing!
This isn't good, guys!

It's up to you, now!
Make it!
I've got it!
Here I go!
Twin Shot!
This is a duo's strength! Hyaaah!
Tak! Right on, Misaki!
Awesome! You did it!
You... You really did it, Hyuga!
That was a nice kick!
I'm not gonna lose, Hyuga!
Kojiro Hyuga, you're truly a wild tiger.
I won't lose, Misaki!
Ngh... I'd expect nothing less, Misaki.
Midfield's mine, Matsuyama!
Damn! You're too strong, Matsuyama.
I won't hold anything back, Misugi!
Misugi... You're something else.
The skies belong to me, Masao!
Did you get lost in the clouds, Masao?
You can't take the sky from me, Kazuo!
Maybe you should stay grounded, Kazuo!
C'mon! I'll take you every time, Nitta!
You've really outdone yourself, Nitta.
I can hold my own, Jito!
Jito... Jeez, you're strong.
It won't be that easy, Soda!
Soda, you're as sharp as ever.
You're mine now, Ishizaki!
Ooh! Not bad, Ishizaki!
That all you got, Takasugi?
You've gotten better, Takasugi...
That won't work on me, Izawa!
Izawa... That was...unexpected.
I don't think so, Takeshi!
Takeshi. Well played.
I can read you like a book, Taki!
I'm impressed, Taki.
You gotta concentrate, Kisugi!
Certainly better than I thought, Kisugi.
Urabe, that all you got?
Persistent as always, Urabe.
I won't lose to you, Schneider!
The Emperor reigns with an iron fist.
Try a little harder, Kaltz!
So this is the artisan...?
I win, Schester!
So this is the Knight of Bremen?
I won't lose to you, Margus!
N-Not bad, Margus!
I know what you're doing, Heine!
Heine, how'd you...!
Time to give up your plans, Pierre!
Pierre, can't say you're without grace.
Not bad, Napoleon!
I'm not losing next time, Napoleon!
This one's mine, Jean!
Jean, how are you so strong?!
I'm not losing to you, Kluivoort!
Didn't expect that from Kluivoort!
You're no match for me, Klismann!
Those are some moves, Klismann!
I win, Kaiser!
Well played, Kaiser!
How's that, Rensenbrink?!
Such a cool guy!
Ya can't just force it, Rusciano!
Rusciano, what was that move?
I win, Robson!
You're definitely more than muscle!
Soccer's about having fun, Carlos!
Carlos... Astounding...
You're one guy I won't lose to, Leo!
Ugh, nice play, Leo!
How about that, Alberto!
Łoł! Not bad, Alberto!
I'm a cut above you, Diaz!
Diaz... What amazing technique!
You have nothin' on me, Pascal!
Whoa, Pascal!
Gotcha, Galvan!
Man, Galvan, you're good!
I've got technique, too, Victorino!
That's the Black Panther for you!
You're like a tree trunk, Senghor!
Łoł! You're a real technician, Senghor.
You'll never win like that, Diallo!
Nice moves, Diallo!
Ryan! Lighten up a little!
Ryan's textbook soccer is solid.
Blake, it's not all about power!
Blake, where do you find that power?
The ball is my friend. It's not scary.
Playing soccer as a pro is my dream!
I entrust my dreams to this ball.
I'll play 'til the last kick!
If I said I'll win, I'll win!
Taking off!
Junior Youth World Challenge\nScrimmage\nJapan vs. America
Drive Shot!
What?!
You call that a Drive Shot? Don't make me laugh.
Junior Youth World Challenge Preliminaries,\nBlock A,\nJapan vs. Italy
(C'mon, here's your chance.\nShow me that Drive Shot!)
If you think you can stop my Drive Shot,\nbe my guest!
H-How?!
Japanese Practice Area\nDay After the Match with Italy
That Drive Shot of yours really packs a punch.
You've buffed up even more since coming to\nAmerica, haven't you?
(No... This still won't cut it.)
(The Drive Shot was useless against Azwan in\nour scrim against the U.S., and it wasn't enough\nagainst Hernandez and Italy earlier.)
(I'll need to do more to score on goalkeepers of\nthis caliber.)
You okay, Tsubasa?
Uh, yeah. I'm fine.
Okay, one more!
...
That's the practice match teams for today.
The tournament's barely started.\nBe sure you're staying ready and focused.
Okay!
All right, Tsubasa. It's you and me today.
Yeah. Even if this is just a practice match,\nI'm not gonna lose.
(That's right...\nThe other team's keeper is Wakabayashi.)
(Hmm... On top of Schneider's own skill, he's no\ndoubt faced down strikers from around the world.)
(He's as good as both Azwan and Hernandez.)
(He can help me figure out what my Drive Shot\nstill needs to compete at the highest levels.)
(I'll focus on my shooting more than usual today\nand figure things out one at a time.)
Okay, guys. Let's get our heads in the game!
Oh, you got me good today.\nThose were some powerful shots.
Oh. Yeah, thanks.
That shot you scored with was exceptionally spicy.
Yep. I thought that one came out just right.
I would've been shocked if it hadn't gone in.
(Still, I can't expect to shoot that perfectly\nall the time in the natural flow of a match.)
(And judging from Wakabayashi's reaction to the\nshot, the Drive Shot's speed, spin, and power...\nare all lacking.)
(Without speed, he'd be ready for it.\nWithout spin, he could read its flight.\nWithout power, it wouldn't reach.)
(To get it to where it's always that perfect,\nI need to do more than iron out a few issues.\nI need to give it a firmer foundation.)
(Hyuga powered up the Tiger Shot and developed\nthe Neo Tiger Shot after coming here to America.)
(He scored a beautifully clean goal on the\ntalented Hernandez.)
(I gotta do even better than that.)
(I'm gonna take my Drive Shot above and beyond\nbefore this tournament's done!)
(I'll build it up the same as I did during the\nAll Japan MS Soccer Tournament!)
Junior Youth World Challenge Finals Tournament,\nQuarterfinals,\nJapan vs. Argentina
(My Drive Shot just wasn't powerful enough\nto take on the world.)
(But everyone else has lent me strength.\nI'm a better player than ever!)
Here we go, Argentina!\nGet a load of my new Drive Shot!
Japanese Practice Area the Following Day
(During the match with Argentina, my Drive Shot\nwas definitely a different beast from what it's\nbeen in the past.)
(Of course, I believe in my Neo Drive Shot.\nIt came together perfectly thanks to everyone.)
(But I'm still not sure it's going to get past\nkeepers on international teams.)
(Of course, I believe in my Neo Drive Shot.\nIt came together perfectly thanks to everyone.)
(But I'm still not sure it's going to get past\nkeepers on international teams.)
Hey, Coach? Can I ask you a favor for today's\npractice match?
What is it, Tsubasa?
You too?
Could you put Wakabayashi in goal on the other\nteam?
I want to see if my new Drive Shot can work on\nhim.
You too?
Huh?
Right. I'll keep what you both asked in mind when\nI divide up teams for practice today.
Thank you!
Genzo asked the same thing. He said, and I quote,\n"I want to play against Tsubasa."
I bet that very Drive Shot you used during the\nArgentina match is what got him fired up as a\ngoalkeeper.
Hey, Tsubasa. Seeing you fire away at the goal\nagain today reminded me how nice a shot you have.
Really? Hmm...\nWell, I can't let him outplay me.
Right. I'll keep what you both asked in mind when\nI divide up teams for practice today.
Thank you!
Your shot today, Tsubasa?
Speaking as a coach,\nGenzo's come into his own in this tournament.\nEven you'll have a hard time scoring on him.
Haha! I wouldn't want it any other way!
Hey, Tsubasa. Seeing you fire away at the goal\nagain today reminded me how nice a shot you have.
Thanks.
(I do think my shooting was pretty good today.)
(Now, I just have to hear what Wakabayashi thought\nabout it.)
But that also means it's not traveling the\nshortest distance to the goal.
Your shot today, Tsubasa?
I want to know what you really thought.\nDon't sugarcoat it.
The best goalies will take full advantage of that.\nThey'll figure out your shot's trajectory,\nand if they can handle the kick's strength...
...
Sorry, man. I don't really have much to say.
You have great kicks. I hate to admit\nthat keeps me driven, but it's the truth.
The only thing is... Well, maybe you won't believe\nme because you did score on me, but...
I felt like I could probably stop it if I had a\nfew more chances to battle it out.
You're right. That's encouraging for sure.
Which part?
(The Drive Shot's particular trajectory does give\nthe goalie time to prepare. That much is true.)
(So, how do I compensate for that? How do I make\nit even harder to stop than it already is?)
Your Drive Shot's hard to stop since it goes in\njust below the crossbar, right?
But that also means it's not traveling the\nshortest distance to the goal.
So, even if it's only a little bit, you're giving\nthe goalie some extra time to get ready once\nyou've taken your shot.
Though the Drive Shot has the advantage of flying\nabove the goalie if his positioning's bad.
Oh, just this table tennis match.
The best goalies will take full advantage of that.\nThey'll figure out your shot's trajectory,\nand if they can handle the kick's strength...
...
Sorry, man. I don't really have much to say.
No, you're good. That was really helpful. Thanks.
Oh, all right.
He was copying my Drive Shot, too.\nI wonder if he had any thoughts about it.
Anyway, I know I'm making it seem bad, but of\ncourse, it's an incredible shot, make no mistake.
After all, you did manage to score on me.
You're right. That's encouraging for sure.
Well, don't think I'm gonna let it happen again.
(The Drive Shot's particular trajectory does give\nthe goalie time to prepare. That much is true.)
(So, how do I compensate for that? How do I make\nit even harder to stop than it already is?)
That was insane. I did not know ping-pong balls\ncould curve like that.
That's pro skills for ya.
(What's this about?)
What are you guys watching?
Oh, just this table tennis match.
Yeah, that guy said your Drive Shot looks like a\ndrive in table tennis, so we thought we'd take\na look.
What'd the guy say exactly?
He was saying the way your Drive Shot moves is\nsimilar to a table tennis thing he saw at school.
So watching a game or two seemed like a good idea.
Oh, all right.
He was copying my Drive Shot, too.\nI wonder if he had any thoughts about it.
He sure has a passion for mastering the game.
Check this out, Tsubasa.\nIt's actually pretty cool.
Łoł! That smash was awesome!
If the drive earlier was like Tsubasa's shot,\nwhat we just saw was like Hyuga's Tiger Shot.
True.
So drives in table tennis work off the same basic\nidea as the Drive Shot, right?
I know. The table tennis just gave me a really\ngood idea and I wanna try it out right away.
The same... probably.
The sharp shift seems to come from the angle of\nthe upward spin and all the speed on the ball.
Absolutely. The ball's course has the same\nfeatures as Tsubasa's Drive Shot, like the\npowerful drop and spin.
That's true. It does look like, because of its\nstrong rotation, it has flex and force on top\nof speed.
(Heavy spin plus a downward move, huh?)
(The thing that makes the Drive Shot good is the\nway it shifts powerfully downward.)
But man, ping-pong balls curve like crazy.\nThat one back there puts even your Razor Shot\nto shame, Soda.
Oh, really? I should show you my Razor Serve\nsometime. Now, that'll make your head spin.
Wait, Soda, you play table tennis, too?
We practice in the gym on rainy days. Days like\nthose, I hang out with the table tennis kids and\nplay a bit.
(At long-range I can kick with full strength to\ncreate a bigger drive arc. That's the way to go!)
I've learned a lot about how to put a good spin\non the ball to make it curve.
Ever the good student, aren't ya?
You know how it is. I study my game as much as\nI study each school's ace.
...
(And since I can really slam it, I'm adding\nrotation. Even from my end, I can see how much\ndeeper it's dipping.)
(But... There's still something...)
(Smashes and drives each have their own\nstrengths.)
(That's it!)
Okay!
H-Hey, Tsubasa, where are you going? You know\nwhat time it is? We start real early tomorrow.
I know. The table tennis just gave me a really\ngood idea and I wanna try it out right away.
Catch ya later!
Uh... Later.
The table tennis, he says. That's so like him.\nThe guy ties everything back to soccer.
And he knows we have an early start tomorrow.\nGotta give him props, I guess.
(How?! I got the shot past him at Nationals!)
(I can't change the Drive Shot's trajectory.\nSo instead of trying to buff out its weaknesses,\nI'll polish its strengths.)
(The thing that makes the Drive Shot good is the\nway it shifts powerfully downward.)
(So, what I need to do is make that shift even\nmore dramatic and increase the force it's\npropelled with!)
(Even if the goalie is ready for it, the added\nforce should give it the power to push through\nhim. It's bound to become a tougher shot to stop!)
(And then I have to maximize its drop.)
(The drive trajectory doesn't work at short range,\nand at mid-range it won't go into the goal without\nsome adjustment.)
(At long-range I can kick with full strength to\ncreate a bigger drive arc. That's the way to go!)
Let's try that!
Junior Youth World Challenge Finals Tournament,\nDay after the Semifinals
(I think the attempt to improve on the Neo Drive\nShot is going pretty well so far.)
(I'm now able to maintain power and rotation all\nthe way to the goal from as far as center field\nwhen I practice.)
(And since I can really slam it, I'm adding\nrotation. Even from my end, I can see how much\ndeeper it's dipping.)
(But what am I missing?)
Yo. Still at it, huh? Even with finals being right\naround the corner, you're one driven dude.
(But... There's still something...)
(No!\nAll I've left to do is try it in a real game!)
Heads up, Tsubasa!
(It's a slight bit far,\nbut this is close to the prime spot.)
(I know that look.\nIs he seriously goin' to shoot from there?!)
Here it goes! Neo Drive Shot!
Wait, Tsubasa, you're too far back...
GO!
It ain't gonna happen!
Ugh, Jito!
(How?! I got the shot past him at Nationals!)
Heh. I came out on top this time.
Jito. How would you compare my Neo Drive Shot\ntoday to how it was at Nationals?
Hmm... 'Sides the fact that I blocked it,\nI admit of all the shots I've taken, its power,\nspeed, and rotation were all top-notch.
But let's see... That thud that you get right\nto your gut, ya know? It wasn't quite there.
The Drive Shot at Nationals hit harder than\nany kick I ever experienced in all my years of\nfighting.
And considerin' it's a souped-up Neo Drive Shot,\nit just didn't pack that punch.
Then again, it could also be that I've been\ntraining like mad ever since. Might just be me.
I see...\nOkay, that gives me something to work with.
Hrm, I can tell ya been thinkin' hard about this.\nYa know, ya can always come to me for help if ya\nneed it.
Of course. Thanks.
I remember. The look in your eyes was so intense\nthat it really intimidated me.
If you can muster that fighting spirit, you'll\nfind what you had and what you're looking for.
(What Jito said this afternoon... It's got to be\nrelated to my sense that something is missing.)
(Roberto's Drive Shot... What I need in my kick\nstill isn't there. I have to figure this out.)
(But what am I missing?)
Yo. Still at it, huh? Even with finals being right\naround the corner, you're one driven dude.
Hey, Hyuga! Takeshi!
Heard from Takeshi that you're still not happy\nwith your Drive Shot.
Yeah, the thing is...
Huh. So, you can shoot that well,\nbut you still aren't satisfied?
I mean, I get it. That struggle's not new to me.\nIt's hard stuff improving your shots.
Sure is. Though what you're going for seems like\na solid concept given how good the shot is\nalready and how it feels.
Still, I think I'm missing something.\nJito thought so, too.
But I can't figure out what it is.\nSo, I guess I'm stuck again.
...
Normally, I don't think I'd have any advice to\noffer to the guy who came up with the Neo Drive\nShot.
You've been trying something new lately,\nhaven't you? I'd love to see you perfect it.\nI know you won't let me down.
But I think I get what it is Jito was trying\nto say.
You do?
(Back then I wanted to win the tourney, of course.\nBut I wanted to get back at Meiwa for beating us\nat prelims, get a perfect win, and go to Brazil.)
Obviously, you've got good technique. You're\nphysically very capable. And you've got power.
But I don't think your most powerful weapon is any\nof those things.
You wanna know what I think Tsubasa Ozora's\ngreatest weapon is? It's your fighting spirit.
Oh...
You know I'm right.
Do you remember during elementary school\nNationals, when we had a showdown right at\nthe end of finals?
Yeah, how could I forget?
I had absolute confidence in my strength,\nbut in that moment, you overpowered me.
It wasn't technique. It wasn't simply power.\nI really think it was your fighting spirit.
I remember. The look in your eyes was so intense\nthat it really intimidated me.
If you can muster that fighting spirit, you'll\nfind what you had and what you're looking for.
You'll kick the ball so hard, I wouldn't be\nsurprised to see it rip through the net.
Sorry, I'm not sure if what I'm saying\nwill actually be practical.\nI'm more speaking from emotion.
No, what you said is really important. Thanks.\nBoth of you!
(The fighting spirit from my youth...)
Japanese Practice Area the Following Day
...
Got a minute?
You improved yet again. I've barely had time to\nrecover from the last time you surprised me.
You said it. The new Drive Shot was awesome\nenough and you went and outdid even that!
I've been asked to put you on a particular team\nfor today's practice match.\nBy two players, in fact.
Why?
Oh, yeah, Ishizaki? You want a little extra\none-on-one training with me?
This time Hyuga joined Genzo in asking to play\nagainst you.
Genzo said this might be the last time he gets to\nplay you in this tournament.
And Hyuga said he wants to pit his fighting spirit\nagainst yours.
(They'd do that for me...)
Great! That sounds fantastic!
You've been trying something new lately,\nhaven't you? I'd love to see you perfect it.\nI know you won't let me down.
You got it!
(I guess he's really my...)
(The final goal from elementary Nationals?)
(Back then I wanted to win the tourney, of course.\nBut I wanted to get back at Meiwa for beating us\nat prelims, get a perfect win, and go to Brazil.)
(And more than anything, I wanted to do right\nby Wakabayashi and Misaki, who were injured\nprotecting Nankatsu's goal.)
(All these things fueled my fighting spirit and\ndrove me forward.)
(I'm going to nab our team a win,\nfor everyone who's helped me be better!)
(Come to think of it, it's a lot like when\nI pieced together the Drive Shot during the\nHirado MS match at Finals.)
(And the things that push me now...)
(I need to show I can compete in international\nsoccer after what happened in the scrimmage.\nI need to get over that wall.)
(Of course, I've made a lot of progress and\nI'm definitely going to Brazil this time.)
(But what I think about most is the hard work\nwe've put in as a group.)
(And the lofty dreams we share, along with how\ngood it will feel to win this tournament.)
(I need to take all that emotion I feel\nand weave it into my fighting spirit.\nThat'll be the might behind my right leg.)
(The lofty dreams we share and how good it will\nfeel to win this tournament.)
(In today's match, I need to take all my emotion\nand make it a part of my fighting spirit.\nThat'll become the power of my right leg.)
(I'll thrust it all into the Drive Shot and score\nthat goal!)
Wakabayashi, Hyuga, here I come!
The shot I took during the match today... That was\nit! That's the new Drive Shot I was looking for.
You went and did it, Tsubasa. You took the shot\nfrom yesterday and gave it even more juice.
Even in a practice match, I can't believe you'd\nbe able to score on me from outside the box.
It looked slower than before from that distance,\nso I was more than ready to stop it,\nbut that hard rotation and the dive got me good.
You know I don't say this lightly.\nThat was a good shot.
Hmph. And when you're shooting from all the way\nout there, it's hard for us defenders to\nblock it.
Pretty impressive connecting an idea from\ntable tennis to that shot.
You improved yet again. I've barely had time to\nrecover from the last time you surprised me.
You said it. The new Drive Shot was awesome\nenough and you went and outdid even that!
I feel like I have to keep working hard to get\nbetter since I'm surrounded by such stiff\ncompetition. Don't want to get left in the dust.
That's what's so awesome about you! I'm fighting\nfor my life just to be able to play at your level.
Oh, yeah, Ishizaki? You want a little extra\none-on-one training with me?
I'll help with that.
N-No, I'm good. I mean, we've got finals soon.\nGotta be in tip-top shape for that!
Ah, yeah, I suppose so.
(I'm sure Wakabayashi asked for me by name for\ntoday's practice match because he knew I was\ntrying to improve my shot.)
(And Hyuga...)
(I was able to remember my fighting spirit from\nmy elementary school days because he came at\nme in full force.)
(I was able to remember my fighting spirit from\nmy elementary school days because he came at\nme with everything he had.)
(If I really think about it, no one's been able\nto draw out my fighting spirit like he has.\nAnd in both elementary and middle school.)
(I guess he's really my...)
You all right there, Tsubasa?
Yeah. I'm good.
(When I was working on the new Drive Shot,\nIshizaki and Misaki... and that first-year\nwere right there training with me.)
(Thanks, guys.)
(I'm going to nab our team a win,\nfor everyone who's helped me be better!)
(Together,\nwe'll become known as the best in the world!)
(You got yourself a good shot, Tsubasa. You did\nit again. Another leap forward in your evolution.)
(But I don't think I'd get this hyped up\nif you were just good at the game.)
(Today, your fighting spirit exploded\nagainst mine.)
(I guess you really are my greatest rival.)
Hey, Urabe, can I ask you a favor?
You want something from me? That's a first.
Okay, let's hear it.
When we last played against your Otomo Quartet\nin the Shizuoka Regional finals,\nI had a nasty feeling in my gut, so I avoided you.
But if we're gonna be playin' the best out there,\nI can't let stuff like that get the best of me.
Even if I get swamped by players from the other\nteam, at least then I'm diverting enemy fire for\neveryone else, y'know?
And if I can find an opening, all the better.
Being risk averse has its advantages,\nbut it's not how I'm going to get better.
I was hoping you could help me prepare to take on\nchallenges like that.
I get you. Sure, I'll do whatever I can.
I mean, I'm sort of honored you came to me with\nthis. You must think highly of our defenders.
Though this'll be tough without Kishida, Nakayama,\nor Nishio around...
Oh, I know. Nitta used to watch us practice,\nso maybe he can chip in.
One sec, I'll go grab 'im.
Great, thanks!
Here it comes, Tsubasa!
I'm ready for anything!
This is just for you!
Gotcha!
Ngh... Guess I'm still too slow.
Alright, one more time!
Okay, my turn! Here I come!
Heh, I'll take that!
Oh no you won't!
What?! You can't possibly be shooting now!
How do your legs move so fast?!
Good, looks like I got the timing down,\nand I can keep control of the ball.
Okay guys, turn it up a notch next time.
Uh... How? That was our best shot.
Ooh, what's this? Some new special training?
Perfect timing! Help us out here!
I see, I see, so that's what's going on.\nI'd love to help!
Time to show you what the Shutetsu Trio can do!
I'm counting on you! Don't hold back!
You're on, Tsubasa!
High time the Silver Duo's defense shut you down!
Not while I'm here!
Gah, even three wasn't enough?!
Still, seems like you've picked up a step.
Wait... Does being pinned down get you hyped?
Maybe a little. Anyway, let's keep going!
If the Shutetsu Trio wasn't enough,\nhow about the Shutetsu Quartet?
Don't forget about me and <avatar_name>!\nNo mercy, alright <avatar_name>?
Ha! Awesome! Everyone's on board then!
Okay, bring it on!
Oof... That's it for me. I'm all out of steam.
Same here. Seems he's got us sorted out.
Tsubasa's still charging around like he just hit\nthe field. He's ridiculous!
You can say that again.
We've even been swapping out, while he has yet\nto even sit down. Does he EVER get tired?
I mean, that's Tsubasa for you. Even back at\nNankatsu, he used to be off running, while we\nwere collapsed on the grass catching our breath.
Hoo, boy... Okay, time out.
We're beat, too.
Come on guys, what's the matter? I can still go!
Sheesh, I wish I had his stamina. Right,\n<avatar_name>?
I want to try this from Tsubasa's side!
I've still got an appetite to challenge Tsubasa!
Birds of a feather, huh?
Not a bad idea!
Did you figure something out from watching me?
Birds of a feather, huh?
Thanks. I'm glad to hear that.
But how about you try taking my position instead,\nnext time?
It'll definitely be good practice.
Hear that? Next we'll have <avatar_name> try...
Or... not. You guys look exhausted.
Sorry... Just give us a little breather.
Then, maybe I should step in.
Misaki!
I was thinking Tsubasa and I would give him\na solid fight. Sound good?
Sweet! Tsubasa and Misaki will be even better\npractice than Ishizaki leading a team of four!
C'mon, man! Did ya hafta call me out like that?
Ha ha!
What's this? Special training for <avatar_name>?\nI want in.
Giving special training to <avatar_name>?\nMind if I join in?
Ya gotta let me jump in!\nI'll never lose to <avatar_name>!
Well, there's no way I'm sitting out when\nwe're training my favorite rookie.\nGuess I gotta suck it up.
Tsk. I'm not about to let that slide!\nYou're on, <avatar_name>!
Whoa there! You're putting <avatar_name> through\nthe ringer without us? How rude!
Think you can break past the Golden Duo AND\nthe Tachibana Twins?
The more the merrier!
Okay <avatar_name>, we're not holding back,\nso you better have come to play, bud!
Hey now, show me some love!\nMisaki isn't the only person out here!
Don't let the size of the field distract you from\nyour own feet! Stay focused!
Wh-What?!
We've been got!
Łoł! That was crazy, <avatar_name>!
I saw a few things that even I would like to add\nto my repertoire.
I never thought anyone could break through\nour ironclad defenses.
Gotta admit, it definitely stings.\nStill, only one way to learn!
Ain't you supposed to be a rookie?\nNever thought you'd put up this much of a fight!
You got that wow factor, <avatar_name>...
What?!\nYou shut down both of Japan's strongest duos?!
Losing's never fun, but to tell ya the truth,\nI'm proud of you, too.
That was amazing, <avatar_name>. You were on fire!
Seems like you realized something while you were\npracticing with Tsubasa.
The way you kick into high gear when surrounded,\nor how you smile in the face of adversity because\nyou relish the challenge makes me think of him.
Most of all, I could tell how much fun you\nwere having. I see a little of me in you.
Anyway, thanks everyone.\nThat was some good practice.
Nice work, <avatar_name>. You kept it fun right to\nthe end. Next time, I'll take you on for real!















































































You know I wouldn't pass on piggy-backin' off your\ntrainin'.















I knew you were good, but I wasn't expectin' that!









Yeah, it's someone from Hirado MS.
From Hirado?























Heeey! <avatar_name>!
You here by yourself?
I came because I thought you'd all still be\npracticing, but it looks like everyone's gone,\neven Ishizaki and Sanaé.
Oh, but this is a good chance.
Pass me that ball, okay?
No? Is this because I'm not supposed to practice?\nHaha, since when were you such a stickler?
I just wanted to see how well my rehabilitation's\nbeen going.
C'mon, just for a bit? I just wanted to take\none shot, as hard as I can.
Anyway, just let me have the ball, alright?
Okay, here I go!
If you were staying late for practice,\nyou could've called me too, you know.
I'll train with you. I've been itching to really\npush myself since they said I was finally\nallowed to exercise.
I'm a little worried if I can still move right\nafter all that rehabilitation. I haven't had a\nchance to test myself yet.
I hope it doesn't hurt... Could you let me have\nthat ball for a sec? I wanna try taking a really\nhard shot.
Okay, here I go!
Driiive Shot!
That felt great! Looks like I was worrying\nover nothing.
I want to try that shot, too!
I bet I could manage that.
Heck, I would too, were I you! Watching people's\nmoves just makes you wanna try 'em out,\ndoesn't it?
What? A Drive Shot?
It's good to have that sort of confidence.\nYou can't accomplish anything if you start out\nthinking what you want is impossible.
Anyway, since you asked,\nI'll give you a little lesson.
That said, there's not much to teach. Vertical\nspin is way harder than horizontal. It took me\nquite a bit of trial and error to pin it down.
And the way I do it won't necessarily work for\nyou, either. If you don't find a way that feels\nright, this'll just be a waste of time.
Are you prepared for that, <avatar_name>?
...Why am I asking when I already know the answer?
Okay, let's do this. You wouldn't believe how many\ntimes I wished someone could just show me what to\ndo when I was trying to learn it.
First things first, I'll teach you the trick\nI figured out for my own Drive Shot.
Keep in mind, I failed who knows how many times\nduring Nationals before I finally pulled it off.
And because I was injured at the time, I realized\njust how much strain it puts on my pivot leg.
So what I want you to get the feel for first is\nhow to use your pivot leg, and how much strength\nto push with.
It's getting pretty late.\nLet's try it one last time.
Make it count, <avatar_name>!
Hmm... Well, you've still got a ways to go.
But I think you're getting the hang of it. Keep\npracticing like this, and I know you'll get it.
With your talent and ambition,\nI've got high hopes for you!
Okay, <avatar_name>! Pass it here!
Watch out, Takasugi!\nIzawa's high ball is coming your way!
Got it!
Get 'em, <avatar_name>! Shoot from there!
You've got a clear shot from there, <avatar_name>!
W-Was that...?!
No way... You've got your own Drive Shot already?!
Th-That was incredible! Flawless!
Heh, after how much I struggled to learn\nthat shot, you made it look easy!\nI knew you had it in ya!
All that hard work paid off!
Yup, I'm a prodigy!
Yup, I'm sure it was thanks to all the effort\nyou put in. I've been down that road, too.
Big talker. Well, can't say you don't have spirit.
But I know exactly how you feel. Making a\ndifficult shot like that has gotta make you\nfeel like a king.
With a shot like that in your arsenal, forget the\nexhibition league, you're a shoe-in to represent\nJapan overseas!
Just keep up the good work!
(So this is how it feels to pass your skills\non to the next generation.)
(I feel like I understand why you taught me\nall these skills, Roberto.)
Looking good there, <avatar_name>!
Was that my Drive Shot just now?\nDid you master it on your own?
So you've been studying how I shoot?
You could've just asked me you know.\nWe're on the same team.
Either way, I don't mind.\nThat desire to learn and make a technique your own\ngets you pretty far in soccer.
You did it, <avatar_name>!\nYou mastered the Drive Shot!
Congrats! I knew it was\nthe right idea to teach you!
Your Drive Shot is perfect now, <avatar_name>!
But as someone with his own Drive Shot,\nI'm not gonna let you outshine me so easily.













After standing on the same field with you for the\nfirst time today, I think I've got a pretty good\nhandle on your soccer, <avatar_name>.









I'd love to compete with you using that move,\nsomeday.
Phew...
Someone's here to see you, Tsubasa.
Me? Who is it?
Yeah. It's someone from Furano MS.
Furano?
Yeah. It's someone from Musashi MS.
Musashi?
Yeah. It's someone from Toho Academy.
Toho?
Oh, you were in that match earlier!
I think your name was <avatar_name>?
I remember you. You played pretty well. I could\ntell you were trying really hard out there.
So did you need something?
Please, teach me the Drive Shot!
Please, let me steal your shot!
Th-This is surprising...
Y-You want to steal it?
Ha ha! I love it! It's great that you're\ntaking the initiative to learn other people's\ntricks of the trade to improve.
And I have a good idea of what it feels like\nto be where you're at right now.
I mean, I do the same thing!
Anyway, sure thing! I'll teach you the trick\nto nailing the Drive Shot.
You're really going to teach him just like that?
Why not?
Having more good players around just makes\nthe competition more enjoyable!
I thought you might say something like that.
Anyway, even though it's a surprise, I'll\nteach you the trick now, so listen closely...
So that's how it should feel when you get\nthe hang of incorporating the rotation.
Of course, it'll vary a little from person to\nperson, so if you don't think it's matching up\nwith what I said, do some research on your own.
I had to do some of that myself,\nto master my own Drive Shot.
It won't be easy, but as long as you keep it up,\nI know you can do it.
I can't say what it is, exactly.\nI just get a certain vibe when I look at you.
Anyway, good luck! See you around!
Hey, <avatar_name>! How's it going?
Take a look at what I've learned!
I've mastered the Drive Shot!
So you've been training? Wait, do you mean\nyou've figured out the Drive Shot?!
F-For real?!
Łoł!
You're amazing, you know that?\nI can't believe you mastered it so quickly.
You must have talent, for sure, but I bet you\nalso put the hard work in to get it right.
And since you practiced that hard,\nit's easy to see you must really love soccer!
Now, I can't wait to play against you in the final\nmatch of the Junior Hero League!
I'll make sure I'm in top condition for it, too.\nSo let's make it a game to remember!
You look happy, Tsubasa.
That's because I am.
(I get the feeling you'll be a great player,\n<avatar_name>.)
(It's just a hunch, but I usually\nhave pretty good hunches.)
<avatar_name>...
We haven't talked much since we started playing\nto represent Japan, have we?
So, uh, this is a little late, but I'm looking\nforward to playing side-by-side.
Come to think of it,\nyour Drive Shot looks a lot like mine.\nDid you study me when you were working on it?
If so, that's kinda flattering.\nI'm glad I could help.
<avatar_name>!\nLooks like you mastered the Drive Shot!
Congrats! I knew it was\nthe right idea to teach you!
We were rivals back in the Junior Hero League,\nbut now we're teammates.
I'm looking forward to working together!
This is such an amazing tournament. We're\ncrossing paths and swords with the best players\nin the world, one right after another.
And that's why I came.
This is my chance to face the strongest opponents\nin the world and become the best...
Not only that, I get to do it alongside all\nthe teammates and rivals I've formed bonds with\nsince elementary school.
And when it's all over, I'll be moving to Brazil\nto become a pro. Someday, I'm going to be\nthe greatest player in the world.
Do you have a dream, <avatar_name>?
I'm going to be the world's best!
For now, it's just to win this!
Meaning you're my rival, too, huh?
But I'm not going down that easy!
Alright, then. Let's do it!
Alright! Let's both do our best\nto realize our dreams!
I'm counting on you!
Everyone's waiting, Tsubasa.\nLet's pick up and get going!
S-Sure.
Hey, what's wrong?
Ugh...
Tsubasa!
Hey, <avatar_name>!\nHelp me carry him to the infirmary!
Sorry about this, guys.
You've gotta stop pushing yourself so far, man.
I mean, you're our captain, you're overseeing\nour training, and studying other teams for\ngames... Superheroes do less in the movies!
Hah... I know, I know. I just suddenly got dizzy.\nI didn't see it coming.
Fine, fine.
I'll let everyone know to leave ya alone\nfor a while, so you get some rest\nbefore you come back, got it?
And you stay and make sure he doesn't\ndo anything stupid, okay <avatar_name>?
Why do you work so hard?
Do you need to push yourself that much?
Why else? To realize my dreams.
I do. How else am I going to become\nthe best player around the globe?
The way I see it, <avatar_name>,\ndreams don't just happen to come true.
You have to work for them day and night,\nyou have to do everything you can.
That way, if you did your best\nand it doesn't work out,\nyou still have nothing to regret.
But the opposite is also true. If you\ndon't do your best, and it doesn't happen,\nyou're left with only yourself to blame.
So that's why I've been pushing myself.\nThat's how I've always lived,\nand how I plan to always live.
Even if other people think it's dumb,\nthat's just who I am.
If there's one thing I can't do, it's doing less\nthan my best when it comes to the soccer I love.
Anyway, thanks <avatar_name>. I'm alright now.
Let's head back to the dorm.
Huh? Where's <avatar_name>?
Him? He's still practicing. He was saying\nsomething about his dream or whatever.
His dream? I see.
Hey, <avatar_name>.\nYou've been working really hard lately.
I have to push myself. Just like you!
I don't want any regrets, either!
<avatar_name>!
<avatar_name>!
Alright, then I'm not falling behind!\nLet's train together!
Nice shot!
Hey guys! Don't you think it's about\ntime to wrap it up?
We can't start dinner without you!
Oh, sorry about that! We're coming!
<avatar_name>...
As the captain of Nankatsu MS, er, rather the\nAll-Japan team, I've been upping my game\nand pushing my limits ever since Nationals.
And just like Ishizaki said, maybe I've\nbeen running myself into the ground.
But of course, I think doing things\nmy way works best for me.
And it's us working hard together earlier,\nkicking the ball around together, that made me\nthink that maybe I am taking the right approach.
You're an amazing player and\na worthy rival. I'm really glad I've had\nthe opportunity to meet you like this.
I think I'll be relying on you a good deal. For\nthe training and all that, but also as someone\nwho loves the games as much as I do.
I think if we spread our wings together,\nwe can really soar.
<avatar_name>!\nToday, I'm going to teach you the Drive Pass.
As you may've guessed from the name,\nit's a pass with the spin of a Drive Shot.
Normally, you wouldn't be able to make a pass\nwhile marked, but with the Drive Pass, it'll sail\nover the opponent's head to your teammates.
Like the Drive Shot, it can't be\nintercepted as it rises and then falls.
It requires delicate control since\nyou're putting spin on the ball, though.
But since you've already mastered the Drive Shot,\nI know you can handle it!
Wow, you've really gotten good\nat dribbling, <avatar_name>.
I know! How about you try\nout one of my dribble moves?
This has been my specialty since\nelementary school: the Heel Lift!
The Heel Lift...?!
C'mon, teach me, too, Tsubasa! I've always\nwanted to know how to do that awesome move!
Sure. Why not!
Now, listen up. The Heel Lift is a move where you\ngrab the ball between your legs while dribbling,\nand flick it up over the opponents' heads.
I'll show you how it's done,\nand then it's your turn to give it a try.
Excellent! That's the way!
Looks like you figured out\nthe trick to it right away.
It's borderline annoying how\neasy you make everything look.
I still can't get the hang of it\nno matter how many times I try...
Ishizaki...
But I won't give up!\nI'll get this down, even if it takes me years!
Tak! That's the spirit, Ishizaki!
You've managed to get up to\nspeed quickly, eh <avatar_name>?
Now, we might even be able\nto pull that shot off together.
I'm going to loft the ball,\nand then we kick it together, okay?
Here we go!
Sweet! That was flawless!
This shot only works when two players\nare in sync down to their breathing.
This'll elevate our play\nas a duo to the next level!
But there's still room to improve! Let's keep on\npolishing our teamwork together, <avatar_name>!
I never tire of seeing you\ngo for broke, <avatar_name>.
Naturally, I try to always give\nit everything I've got, as well.
But seeing you out there pushing yourself to\nyour limits makes me want to go all in, too.
I'm sure that someday you'll be a captain,\nleading your own team.
And when that day comes, I hope your teammates\ntake the same courage in seeing you play.
Nothing inspires a team more than seeing their\ncaptain play his heart out. Remember that!
Let's practice our high-speed passing, Misaki!
Sure thing, Tsubasa!
That's our Misaki! He's perfectly in\nsync with Tsubasa's quick Combo Passes!
Ha ha... It's nothing much.
How about you give it a shot, <avatar_name>?
Hey now... No matter how good he is\nthere's no way he can keep up with Tsubasa.
Let's go, <avatar_name>!
Whoa... That was crazy!\nYou were amazing, <avatar_name>!
It's because he's been closely observing\nTsubasa all this time, trying to glean\nwhat he can do to improve.
It seemed likely by now he'd have picked up the\ntiming of the passes, as well as the basic skills.
Makes sense...
Man, if you can tell at a glance who'd make a\ngood partner for Tsubasa, then you really are\nthe ultimate duo!
When you dribble, <avatar_name>, it almost\nlooks like the ball sticks to your feet.
Friends stick close together, eh?
Treating the ball as a friend...\nSounds just like you, Tsubasa.
Ishizaki...
That reminds me. Back in elementary school,\nTsubasa used to carry a soccer ball with him all\nday, so he could practice at any time.
Yup! Sure did!
It caused him a lot of trouble, too.\nLike, he'd dribble to school, but if he slipped up\nor hit a pothole, he'd be late for class.
Now that you mention it,\nI even took baths with that ball.
Seriously? I guess it's not that hard to believe.
Ha ha...
The ball has always been that\nimportant of a friend to me.
I even keep all my old,\nworn-out soccer balls at home.
I could never abandon a friend...
Whoa...
So as a fellow lover of the sport,\nI hope you'll show your ball the same respect.
That way your friendship with it will grow!
I've taken a long, hard look\nat your soccer, <avatar_name>.
With your technique and smarts, you'll definitely\nbe able to master my South American Dribble.
As promised, I'll teach it to you. Now, listen\nclosely.
We'll start with how to maintain\nyour balance and control the ball...
But there's something else equally important\nfor predicting your opponent's moves.
Players you come up against will try to\ndivine your next move in order to stop you.
So you have to think two,\nor even three, moves ahead.
Once you've got the balance, the technique,\nand the read, you can start using the\nSouth American Dribble.
Don't worry. I know you can do it. Good luck!
One more thing, though...
I want to compete with you\nto see who can do it best!
<avatar_name>, I'm going to teach you the Neo\nDrive Shot, just like I promised before the match.
Actually... I've been going back and forth\non whether I should teach you this or not.
I'm sure you know the Neo Drive Shot is a shot\nwhere you add the Drive spin to a full power kick.
To achieve that, it requires far more technique\nthan an ordinary Drive Shot, and it puts more\nof a burden on your legs and body, too.
You're two years younger than me,\nand your body's still growing.
So I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to\nteach you a shot that bears such a heavy\nphysical burden.
But after seeing you play today, and how much\ntougher you've become after all these matches,\nI'm sure you can handle it.
There's no reason not to teach\nyou the Neo Drive Shot now.
Now listen up, the trick is to...
Yeah, you got it! Great work, <avatar_name>!
I knew you could handle it!
I hope it comes it handy!
Okay, <avatar_name>, it's almost time for the\nclosing ceremony. Let's head back to the bench.
<avatar_name>?
Look at this, Tsubasa!
I've mastered that shot!
<avatar_name>! No way!
I see... So you saw the shot I used in the finals\nback at Nationals, and practiced it on your own?
You're really eager to learn\nother people's moves, aren't you?
I'm the same way.
That's how I've managed to keep on\nimproving my soccer skills all this time.
But don't think you've got me\nbeat just yet, <avatar_name>.
We'll fight it out to the end to\nbe the world's best soccer player!
<avatar_name>, back when you first learned\nthe Neo Tiger Shot, I already had a feeling\nthings would turn out this way.
I think... We can pull off that shot together.
The Twin Shot composed of both the\nNeo Drive Shot and the Neo Tiger Shot.
No one would be able to stop\nsuch a powerful combo move.
Let's keep on doing our best together,\nand reach for the stars!
Phew...
Someone's here to see you, Tsubasa.
Me? Who is it?
Yeah. It's someone from Furano MS.
Furano?
Yeah. It's someone from Musashi MS.
Musashi?
Yeah. It's someone from Toho Academy.
Toho?
Yeah. It's someone from Hanawa MS.
From Hanawa?
Oh, you were in that match earlier!
I think your name was <avatar_name>?
I remember you. You played pretty well. I could\ntell you were trying really hard out there.
Do you need me for something?
Please, teach me the Drive Shot!
Please, let me steal your shot!
Th-This is surprising...
Y-You want to steal it?
Ha ha! I love it! It's great that you're taking\nthe initiative to learn other people's tricks of\nthe trade to improve.
And I have a good idea of what it feels like to be\nwhere you're at right now.
I mean, I do the same thing!

We're not out of the woods yet!
Gotta score to win!
Focus! We're just warmin' up!
We'll turn this around! I know it!
Nice one!
Nice!
Not bad!
Oh man...!
Seriously?!
Stop them!
Nice pass!
Alright!
On it!
I'm up!
I'm open!
Over here!
C'mon! Here!
Pass it here!
Your efforts won't be in vain!
I'm ending this!
It's now or never!
Eat this!
Here it comes!
Graaah!
Tiger Shot!
Tiger Shot!
Here's my Tiger Shot!
Get in my way... Get blown away!
...gets taken out!
This is my Neo Tiger Shot!
Neo Tiger Shot!
Neo Tiger Shot! Here we go!
Tak!
Here it comes!
Now!
Move!
Outta the way!
Take this!
Can't stop me!
For the win!
I'm winning this!
Time for the Twin Shot!
This is the power of two! Fire away!
Press in!
Nice one, Takeshi!
You know it!
Woohoo, nice Tsubasa!
Yes!
Had to happen someday, Tsubasa!
Why can't I win, Tsubasa?!
What'd you expect, Misaki?!
Y'don't seem rusty to me, Misaki!
I'll take you on anytime, Matsuyama!
Don't think I'm giving up, Matsuyama!
No mercy today, Misugi!
That brings back memories!
That's not gonna work on me, Masao!
Man, you're good, Masao!
I don't think so, Kazuo!
Ya got some chops, Kazuo!
Heh, you're not quite there yet, Nitta.
Guess you're not all talk, Nitta!
Bein' tough doesn't win every fight!
Gah! I'll get'cha next time, Jito!
You can't handle this, Soda!
Gah! "Ace Killer" no doubt!
What'd ya expect, Ishizaki?!
Dang! I lost to Ishizaki?!
Take this seriously, Takeshi!
You've come a long way, Takeshi.
It won't be that easy, Sorimachi!
Didn't know you were worth the trouble.
Did you really think you could best me?
Sawaki outplayed me?!
I won't be humiliated again, Schneider!
I'll remember this, Schneider!
Don't get cocky, Heine!
Don't you mock me, Heine!
Pierre, you ain't got nothin'!
When'd you learn that, Pierre?!
I'm the alpha striker, Napoleon
Gah! I can't believe Napoleon beat me!
No one can stop me, Jean!
The Shield of France...
Don't underestimate me, Kluivoort!
Don't think you've won, Kluivoort!
It'll be the same every time, Rusciano!
I won't take this lying down, Rusciano!
Where's your spirit, Carlos?!
Man! It's like he's not even tryin'!
Big mistake, Diaz!
Come on... Don't be so smug, Diaz!
The Tiger devours the Panther!
Panther, huh? I'll get you next time!
You need more than technique, Senghor.
Gah! Nice moves, Senghor.
I won't go easy on you, Ryan!
This guy's the same age as Takeshi?!
I won't be beaten so easily, Blake!
Gah! Next time that'll be you!
Everything rides on this!
This is REAL soccer!
I've had enough of losing to you!
That was just a warm-up!
This is my win! No question!
Junior Youth World Challenge\nScrimmage\nJapan vs. England
Eat this! Tiger Shot!
Don't count your chickens before they're hatched!
Wh-What?!
You won't overpower me with raw strength!
That night...
*pant* *pant*
(I've gotten pretty used to training with this\nweighted ball Coach Kira gave me.)
(I was worried how it’d turn out at first since\nthe burden on my leg was too much, but then I\nreally started getting the sense I’d powered up.)
(If I keep this up, I should be able to make the\nTiger Shot better than ever!)
Hey, Hyuga. How you doing?
Oh, you guys are practicing late too, huh?
I was just put on defense too, so there's still\nloads I don't know. I've got a lot to work on.
That's why Misugi said he'd coach me.
I am somewhat in charge of the team's defense.
So I was thinking it's about time I passed my\nknowledge and experience on to Matsuyama.
I see... You guys are really working hard, huh?
Anyway, how're you doing, Hyuga?\nYou look pretty spent.
True, I guess I can seem like I push people\ntoo hard.
Honestly, as a coach, you getting worn out\npracticing something with no guaranteed payoff\nis a worry.
Our team's coming together well, so I'd like to\nfocus on proper conditioning as the big match\ngets closer.
...
Relax. I'll be in perfect shape for the match\nand get something out of this special training.
In that case, I've got nothing more to say.\nI believe in you, Hyuga.
Well, I can't spend all my time worrying about\neverybody. Let's do this together!
Absolutely.
(My legs have grown stronger thanks to my special\ntraining with this black ball.)
(But like Misugi said, I can't be sure\nthis'll really accomplish anything...)
(If this training doesn't pay off and I still\ncan't compete at an international level...)
(That'll be like the world of soccer telling\nme everything up til now wasn't enough...\nThat I failed. And if that happens, I'll...)
(No, I can't doubt myself now!)
(The world won't give you anything if you can't\nbelieve in yourself!)
(All I can do is have faith I'm going down the\nright path and keep running forward!)
Haaah!
Listen up, everyone! This is our last practice\nmatch before the big game!
Practice your formations and strategies,\nand make any necessary adjustments that are left.
(The goalie is Wakashimazu... All right!)
(He's faced my Tiger Shot many times since the\nnationals...)
(Meaning he's the perfect test for the fruits\nof my training and everything else I've got!)
What do you make of Hyuga's performance today,\nMisugi?
Hmm...
He's regained much of his former strength.
If anything, I'd say he's more of a force to be\nreckoned with than ever.
I thought you'd say that. I figure he'll pull\nthrough the finals just fine if he plays like\nhe did today.
Got a minute, Wakashimazu?
Sure, what's up?
I'll be direct... Do you think my Tiger Shot\ntoday is any different from how it used to be?
Hmm... Well, honestly, I felt your shots today\nwere faster and stronger than before.\nYour accuracy seemed better, too.
I see. Whew, that's a load off my mind.
(I'm on the right path... My legs are stronger\nand my skills have improved.)
(If I can fully recover, then I should be able to\ncome up with an even stronger Tiger Shot using my\nincreased leg strength!)
But how'd you pull this off in such a short time\nwhen you're still not at full strength?
It's all thanks to Coach Kira's special training.
Huh?
He believed in me more than I did. All that's left\nis to take on the world and see how it pays off.
Yeah. I'm relieved to see you're back on top, too.
Nitta's also been improving his game, so I've got\nhigh hopes for you guys. I could see you two\nforming a lethal pair.
Nitta, huh? Yeah, I could see that.
I thought he was a cocky jerk when we met back at\nNankatsu, but he's got serious talent for sure.
He won against Takeshi's Meiwa FC from the\nelementary school days, and he was chosen as\na rep in his second year.
I think his speed in particular will make him\na real weapon, even compared with other reps.
But I don't plan on giving up my throne as\nJapan's ace striker no matter how good Nitta gets.
I'd expect no less. I got faith in you too, Hyuga.
(Nitta's speed really is nothing to scoff at...\nMuch as I hate to admit it, he's probably faster\nthan me.)
(If only I had jet engines like he's got...)
(No, it's not the time to get distracted.)
(All I have to do for now is prove to the world\nthat I chose the right path.)
(And to do that, I have to perfect the Neo Tiger\nShot. Then, I'll show them a kick that rivals the\nbest of the best!)
Junior Youth World Challenge Preliminaries,\nBlock A, Japan vs. Italy
(I hope you're watching me, Coach Kira.)
(This is my new shot, perfected using that\nblack ball you sent me.)
(I don't care if you're the best goalie in\nEurope, this shot is gonna bury you!)
Have a taste of this! Neo Tiger Shot!
I did it... I really did it!
Junior Youth World Challenge\nPost-Quarterfinals...
Phew... Maybe I should go a little longer.
Working hard there, huh?
Oh, Mr. Katagiri!
That was one loud shot you made. I could hear it\nall the way from outside. Since I was in the\nneighborhood, I figured I'd come watch.
That kick is really an ace up your sleeve,\nisn't it?
I had my doubts about the three years of growth\nyou had before nationals, but now you've become\na real model ace striker rep.
Thank you... But I couldn't have done it without\nCoach Kira and everyone at Toho Academy.
Even so, your shot is amazing.\nIt's right up there with Schneider's Fire Shot.
Actually, it may even be better in terms of\npushing the goalkeeper back.
Y-You really think so?!
I believe it's a technique that could get past\nHernandez, and he's the one who only once let\nSchneider score.
Though perhaps, I'm just hoping for the best,\nsince I want to see Japan succeed.
Either way, I'm still happy to hear it.
(I see. So I chose the right path after all.)
But all that being said, I can't say that you've\nsurpassed Schneider as a striker.
What?
I've heard you're striving to be the world's\ngreatest ace.
So I've got a word of advice as a former striker\nrepresenting Japan.
What is it? Tell me, please!
People tend to get distracted by how flashy\nSchneider's shot is, but he has all his other\nbases as a forward covered, too.
He has a wealth of plays to set up shots on goal,\nsuch as the volley heel sliding shot he exhibited\nin the preliminaries.
He rarely leaves any openings. You won't find\nthem in his dribbling, his shooting technique,\nand often not even in his passes.
On top of that, he's got the Fire Shot,\nwhich makes for quite the artillery.
...
You've learned a shot that rivals, possibly even\nsurpasses, the Fire Shot in some respects.
However, I think he's got the upper hand when\nit comes to other plays.
Yeah, maybe you're right...
That said, I don't think that's all our ace\nstriker has in him.
Which is why I'd like to make a suggestion.
Now that you've got all these shots down pat, what\nwould you say to learning a new way to attack as a\nforward?
Work on something new?
That's right.
If you're confident in your skills, then I'd like\nyou to try expanding your horizons as a striker.
(That's true... My soccer fundamentals should be\nsolid after perfecting the Neo Tiger Shot.)
(Maybe Mr. Katagiri's right. Maybe this is the\nopportunity I need to take my game to a new\nlevel.)
(Plus, I've been wondering if I can put all that\ntraining with the black ball to use in ways other\nthan shooting.)
(I especially feel like I can dash a lot faster\nthan I used to, so first order of business should\nbe considering how to weaponize that.)
Looks like you've got something in mind.
Thanks for the advice.
I was frustrated with the play against\ninternational teams, and I think it'd be an honor\nif the world's top ace striker was Japanese.
You all carry the weight of a dream we have.\nA dream to show Japan is the best in the world.
Do the best you can.
Tak! I won't let you down!
We're playing a practice match with Uruguay today.
Our next match is against France. Their defense is\nso strong that they completely shut out Uruguay.\nThe same Uruguay that's led by Victorino.
So we need to be good enough to rack up goals\nwhile defending against Uruguay if we hope to take\non France.
Keep that in mind. Got it?
Got it!
(Scoring while shutting down their offense, eh?\nThen, I should strike fast.)
(And Victorino is one of the fastest dashers in\nthe tournament.)
(It'll be a good chance to find out just where\nI stand in that respect.)
(I'll try out everything I can to become the\nworld's number one ace striker!)
Great shot, Hyuga!
Thanks.
(My short range dashing feels like it's getting\nto where it needs to be.)
(I should use it for fast attacks when there's an\nopening. I've got a good idea of what my new\noffense should be.)
(However, I can tell I'm still no match for\nVictorino's dashing and speed.)
(I know a fast attack can make all the difference,\nbut simple speed won't be enough for our offense\nto compete at the international level.)
(I'll have to put something together with the\ndash. Hmm, what to do...)
...
(Come to think of it, that guy went around to\nother countries' practices and managed to improve\nhis game from watching other players.)
(That's it! I should follow his example and use\nplayers from all around the world as references!)
The next day...
Italy's Practice Pitch
(I've learned there are all kinds of styles\nof offense from the international matches\nI've been in so far.)
(Schneider, Blake, Napoleon, Carlos, Kluivoort...\nThere are plenty of strikers that use super\npowerful shots.)
(But Rusciano from Italy stands out from the\npack.)
(His playing style is nothing like any other\nplayer I've seen.)
(His world-class skills and power, ability to\nbreak through, teamwork, and shot technique are\nall incredible.)
(But what surprised me the most was his wide range\nof plays when countering.)
(That final point he scored against the\nNetherlands in particular employed a completely\ndifferent offense from my own.)
(He may be a rival, but he'd be worth studying,\nconsidering all he's got going for him.)
Oh, Rusciano's got the ball!
That was a quick restart from the goalie.\nA counter will likely...
Łoł! Did you see that speed?! How'd he manage to\nget through that with such a small window to work\nwith?!
But he's spending time on the opposing side to...\nOh!
He left himself open to his teammate coming up\nfrom behind! Those sorts of moves make good study\nmaterial for midfielders like myself, too.
Now, he's taking the ball around and going for a\nlong shot!
Amazing... Not only is he quick on his feet,\nbut his quick thinking let him pull off an\nimpressive play.
I see, so he's good at improvising, huh?
Training and instinct's part of it, but I think\nall his fast attacks are what really won the\nday for him.
If you ask me, I think there might be some sort\nof trick to it all. Why don't we go and ask him?
You mean... right now?
Yep! You need to take action whenever you get the\nchance. I learned that from him, too!
Yeah... You're right.\nNot like we'll get many other chances. Let's go.
...And there you have it. Which is why we were\nwondering if you would tell us if there's a trick\nto your fast attacks.
...And there you have it. Which is why we were\nwondering if you would tell us if there's a trick\nto your fast attacks.
...
Ah, now it all makes sense.\nHow about it, Rusciano?
You're wasting your time.
What?!
I heard you out since you're the guy who scored\non Zino...
But don't come here just to ask such a dumb\nquestion, Hyuga.
Wh-What did you say?!
I'm just stating the facts.\nGot a problem with that?
Grr... I dare you to say that again!
Huh? You wanna go? Then bring it on!
Hyuga, chill out!
Give it a rest, Rusciano!
Ugh...
Hmph!
They came to ask for your help because they were\nimpressed. There's no call to be rude.
...
Normally, players defending against fast attacks\ncan't prepare for every attack pattern out there.
Normally, they'll prep to play against you in\nparticular. Meaning you'll either have to outplay\nthem, mix things up and surprise them, or...
Well, figure out the rest for yourself.\nThat's what soccer's all about.
There, happy now, Zino? Later.
I'm really sorry you got treated like that\nafter making the trek out here.\nThat guy's a real hothead sometimes.
We're sorry, too.\nHyuga can be the same way, actually.
Hey! Whose side are you on?!
Aha, I see what you mean.
Ugh...
Still, you've got a big appetite when it comes\nto soccer, huh? You're already a great shooter,\nyet you're not satisfied.
I can still feel that shot of yours in my right\narm, you know.
But I'm not gonna lose to you again. I'm going\nto train until I'm stronger than ever before.\nI look forward to our next match.
Same here.
Thanks for all your help!
We learned a lot from watching Rusciano play.
Much as I don't like him, his soccer skills sure\nare something.
I dunno if I can pull off any of his stunts,\nbut he gave me some food for thought about\nattacking fast.
You mean when he talked about outplaying defenders\nor mixing things up?
No, it was that third option he sorta brought up\nat the end. When he said "or."
Huh?
(I'm pretty sure I know what he was getting at!)
Junior Youth World Challenge Semifinals,\nJapan vs. France
GOAL!
In a do-or-die moment during the last half of the\ngame, Nitta gets off a super-long Running Volley\nFalcon Shot! And it goes in France's goal!
I did it! I actually did it!
You did! Nice shot, Nitta!
We made it work, Urabe!
After the match...
Nitta's final shot sure was something, wasn't it?
Yeah. His prized dashing and one-of-a-kind direct\nVolley Shot came together in perfect harmony.
He's amazing. I could've never pulled that off\nwith my speed.
I gotta say he really showed me something.
Huh?
I'm saying I've figured out that new offense of\nmine! I think I know what to do.
Days later...
Okay, practice match time.\nThe teams are as follows...
(So I'm up against Wakabayashi today?)
(Get a load of my new offensive strats!)
Wakashimazu?
Yeah, what's up?
There's something I wanna try out in today's\npractice match.
Ah, I see...
Getting a quick restart after an attack on goal\nwill be important.
Sorry, but could you keep that in mind and try it\ntoday in our practice match?
Of course! You can count on me!
Awesome! I owe ya one.
(I've come up with a strategy after thinking over\nwhat Rusciano said and that goal Nitta made during\nthe match with France.)
(My typical style is to break down my opponents\nfacing them head on.)
(That means my opponents will be wary of me trying\nto break through them by force when I've got the\nball, especially when pushing in fast.)
(Which is why that's the moment where I have to\nboggle them with a burst of speed and do something\nthey're not expecting.)
(My chance for a fast attack will come when the\ngoalie catches the ball.)
(With the opponent's side of the field spread out,\nI'll use my dashes to dribble the ball right\nthrough them.)
(Then, once I'm past their defense, I'll use the\nspeed I've built up to charge the goal.)
(I'll be running so fast that I should be able to\nlaunch a stronger Tiger Shot than usual.)
(That way, I'll score a goal by both taking my\nopponents by surprise and driving past them!)
Tak! I pulled it off!
Hyuga, that play you pulled off today is the new\noffensive strategy you said you figured out,\nright?
That's our Hyuga! Pure perfection!
Guess it was worth watching the Italians\nafter all!
Urgh... What was that, Hyuga? I've never seen\nanything like that from you before.
A certain someone told me that I'd never be the\nworld's greatest striker with powerful shots\nalone.
So I came up with a new way to attack.\nThis was the debut performance.
It never hurts for an ace striker to have all\nsorts of ways to score points.
I see, so that's what that was about.\nThat was really awesome, Hyuga.
You're telling me. I sure as heck wasn't expecting\nyou to use your speed to boost your power like\nthat.
The force of a shot that combines speed and\nstrength sure is impressive, I must admit.
Ugh, hearing an honest compliment from you feels\nwrong.
But that play has a weakness.
I noticed you were so focused on pulling it off\nthat your regular shots lacked their usual oomph.
Gah! Now that's more what I was expecting you to\nsay!
He has a good point, though.
Though even I'll be the first to admit that your\nshot had more power to it when you used the\nmomentum from your fast attack.
I'm sure a shot that powerful would even work\nagainst Muller. I can't wait to see the goals\nyou'll be scoring in the finals.
Yeah, I won't let you down! I'll help make Japan\nthe best in the world, I swear it!
Rusciano, what did you think of Hyuga's play\ntoday?
He broke right through with his speed and\noverwhelmed his opponents with his power.\nSimple stuff.
...At least, that's probably what it just looked\nlike to most people.
...
Man, I'm hungry. Catch you later.
(He surprised the defenders and then overpowered\nthem... Looks like Hyuga understood Rusciano's\nmessage.)
(You meet the most interesting people in this\nsport... Now, I've got another name on my list\nof people I need to play against properly.)
Looks like Hyuga's made it work, Katagiri.
I was hoping he'd find a creative spark, but I\nnever expected he'd achieve results so quickly.
Hyuga had already improved his Tiger Shot and\nearned a place on the world stage, but I never\nthought he'd grow even more during the tournament.
I agree. Though I hear he's got quite the rivalry\nwith Schneider.
That fierce determination to never lose and the\npotent ambition that drives him is what makes\nHyuga who he is.
I believe that our dream will come true with\na Japan centered around Captain Tsubasa Ozora\nand featuring ace striker Kojiro Hyuga.
He'll have to lead Japan starting next year to\nmake that a reality.
Right, because Hyuga's the only one who can lead\nJapan to victory now that Tsubasa's gone to\nBrazil.
I was worried before nationals, but now I'm\nconfident we can leave the high school soccer\nteam in Hyuga's hands.
Other athletes will do everything they can to\nsurpass Hyuga. The next three years will be key\nfor Japanese soccer.
Maybe this isn't something we should be thinking\nabout before the finals of a major tournament,\nbut it's hard not to get my hopes up.
Alright, next is the hundredth!
Ngh! Impressive, Hyuga. A hundred shots and\nthey're just as powerful as the first.
*pant* *pant*
Okay, next up is circuit training! Idziemy!
G-Got it!
We're just getting started, Wakashimazu!\nWe've got ten more sprints!
Racja!
And now back to shooting training! Here we go!
Your shot is weaker, Hyuga!
Drat! I can't believe I'm already out of gas...
No way, I'm just gettin' started!\nLet's go again, Wakashimazu!
You got it!
Ugh! That shot hit harder than the last?!
That's just a warm-up!\nTime to shift into high gear!
What are you up to this late?
You two look absolutely wrecked!
*pant* *pant*\n<avatar_name>, huh.
Can't ya tell? We're training.
Don't start with that 'rest is part of training'\nrhetoric. We don't have that kind of luxury right\nnow.
*pant* *pant* Oh, <avatar_name>.
We're pretty tired, but we can still keep going.
Back in the summer when I was tryin' to regain my\ndrive for victory and master a new shot, I fought\nthe raging sea in Okinawa.
The oncoming waves ate away at my stamina, and my\nshots kept bouncing off too, so I almost gave up\nmore times 'n I can count.
But I couldn't let myself just lose to Tsubasa\nlike that, so I gave it everything I had and kept\non shootin'.
Until finally I got legs that wouldn't flinch from\na wave, and a Tiger Shot that could pierce right\nthrough 'em.
That's where I learned that you need more than\nstrength and skill, ya need confidence and grit.
You gotta be able to push yourself to your limits.
We're two games away from the championship...\nBut they ain't gonna be easy.
Next up is the finals. But they want it just as\nmuch as we do, it ain't gonna be easy.
Which means it's gonna be tougher than anything\nwe've faced so far. Both physically and mentally.
When you're driven into a corner, faith in\nyourself is what will bring out your 110%.
So here we are, driving ourselves to the limit.\nThat's how to attain a strong body and a strong\nheart.
That's why we pushed ourselves to the limit. It's\nhow you attain a strong body and a strong drive.
Well, I do feel kinda bad about makin' ya stick\nwith me, Wakashimazu.
What are you talking about? I'm here because I\nfeel the same way.
The tougher the situation, the more we strive to\novercome.
That's what we teach in Wakado Style Karate, too.\nI've always trained like this.
I see...
Hey, <avatar_name>.\nSince you're already here, how 'bout you join us?
But just so ya know, I ain't holdin' back.\nIf we're doing this, I'm hittin' ya with my\neverything!
Here I come!
Phew. That got 'er done.
You still practicing, <avatar_name>?
Just hadta say, you sure\nshowed your mettle last match.
But I know you can do better than that.\nIf you're satisfied with just that,\nthen you'll be yesterday's news in no time.
Racja! I'll figure out the Tiger Shot!
That's why I need the Tiger Shot!
What?! The Tiger Shot...?
So that's how it is? I getcha.
Well, it's good to dream big, but this won't\nbe a cakewalk. Think you can handle it?
Of course!
There's nothing I can't do!
Well, that's the right attitude.
You've got confidence, at least.
Fine, I'll teach ya. There's a few things\nyou'll need to master the Tiger Shot.
First, ya need legs like steel girders that won't\ngo wonky under pressure. Second, you need an\nindomitable spirit that's hungry for victory.
What I did was throw myself into a typhoon\nand challenge Mother Nature, herself.
That's how I mastered the Tiger Shot that can\npierce through the most powerful waves to ever\ncrash ashore.
I ain't saying you gotta do exactly what I did,\nbut put in that same level of effort,\nand you'll probably get the same results.
I can't wait to see how far\nyour determination takes you.
Countin' on you, Hyuga!
Sure thing!
Here it comes! Tiger Shot!
Block it, guys!
Nice work!
Ugh! It's tough getting\nthrough three guys at once...
The ball's loose! Get it <avatar_name>!
Okay, full power!
Time for my training to mean something!
What the...?!
How in the...?!
No way!
A Tiger Shot?!
<avatar_name>! You... really did it!
I trained like my life depended on it!
I worked so hard I thought I'd die...
Your life, huh...?
Given the results,\nI can imagine how much you put in.
No doubt.
I bet you aren't even exaggerating. I can tell.
I've seen your resolve with my own two eyes.\nYou're a real man!
If we'd had your Tiger Shot back at the\nchampionship match, Toho Academy would've won,\neasy!
Alright, <avatar_name>! Don't hold back on us now!\nUse that new shot and let's win this whole league.
Here I come!
Phew. Perfect.
You...
Oh, right. <avatar_name>?
I feel like I've seen you around...
<avatar_name>, right?
So. Why'd you come all the way over\nto Toho Academy? Need something?
Please, teach me the Tiger Shot!
I want a super shot, too!
EH?! The Tiger Shot...?
Then come up with one yourself.\nWhy you buggin' me about it?
Wait, don't tell me you want me to\nteach you the Tiger Shot? Seriously?
We're on opposing teams, right? What's your angle?
To help my team win, of course!
I want a shot that can carry my team!
You want to help your team so much you'd\ngo begging to someone from another team?
I get you. I'm a striker, too. I know that desire.
But desire alone isn't enough. I put\nblood and sweat into mastering that shot.
In the end, it all comes down to your\ndetermination. If this is about you looking\nup to me or whatever, then give up now.
That look... You're serious, aren't you?
Jeez, fine. I'll tell you how\nI came up with my technique, anyway.
I stood on the beach in a typhoon, kicking shot\nafter shot into the oncoming waves. I pointed my\nmind like a spear and drove the ball forward.
I wouldn't let my legs lose to the waves,\nand my spirit wouldn't let me back down.\nI'd face anything to achieve my dreams.
And once I found that place in my heart, I\ndiscovered a shot that pierced straight through\nthe crashing waters. That was the Tiger Shot.
Still think you can handle it?\nHeh, then let me show you how it's done.
If you manage to pull it off, I'll give you the\ncredit your due. But persistence is the name of\nthe game. Until then, good luck.
<avatar_name>, huh? Need something?
I want to show you my persistence!
I'm ready to show you I'm the real deal!
Wh-What?!
Wh-What?!
That was a solid Tiger Shot!\nI can't believe you really did it!
Are you impressed?
That's how much I want to win!
After that, how could I not be?
I guess I hadn't acknowledged you\nfor the player you really are.
Now, I've seen your hunger for victory with my own\ntwo eyes. You're a genuine champion in the making!
Take that spirit and win your way through\nthe league! I can definitely see you coming to\nrepresent Japan now.
Good luck, <avatar_name>! I'll be waiting for you!
I'm looking forward to our match.
Which of us is hungrier, stronger?\nGuess we'll find out!
Hoo! Ha! Hoo! Ha!
Who's there?! Oh, it's just you, <avatar_name>.
Practicing? At this time of night?
You need to get some rest.
Heh, I could say the same to you.\nWhat're you doing here?
I'll never be able to take on the world\nif I can't handle a little evening practice.
Besides, you're here, too!\nGreat minds think alike, eh?
We need to be stronger if Japan's gonna win,\nso we gotta use our time as best we can.
Okay, <avatar_name>, time to show me what\nyou're made of! Give me your best shot!
Think of me as a player on the\nopposing team and really lay into it!
Ugh! I knew it!\nYou truly have mastered the Tiger Shot!
But that's not enough! That won't be sufficient to\ndefeat all the other teams playing at the national\nlevel.
(Whoa! What the heck was that?!)
(How did <avatar_name> develop\nsuch a powerful kick?!)
Hey! <avatar_name>! How'd you do that shot?
Oh, I see...\nI had a feeling you were copying my training.\nSo you wanted to learn the Tiger Shot, then?
I learned by kicking into waves on the beach\nduring a typhoon. Still, seems like you put in\njust as much effort, in your own way. Impressive.
The Tiger Shot is now as much\nyours as it is mine, <avatar_name>.
But you'll need more than that\nif you wanna take on the world.
You remember that scrimmage with Germany?
And Schneider's Fire Shot?
When I first mastered the Tiger Shot I figured\nthat was the best kick there was, but my pride\nwas shattered after seeing him in action.
I bounced back from the shock by\ndeveloping the Neo Tiger Shot.\nAnd my confidence is as steady as ever, now.
But I've still got room to grow! I'll make\na shot that'll leave everyone breathless!
Still, someday I'll catch up...\nHeck, I'll leave him in the dust, you'll see!
Listen, you've gotta dream big, too. Dreams are\nthe vehicle that lets us move ahead in life.
Aw jeez, I let my body cool down while we were\ntalking. Guess I'll run another lap and head back.
Here I go, <avatar_name>!
What's the matter, <avatar_name>?\nSomething you wanna ask?
I am still your captain, after all.\nAsk me anything.
Huh? You want to know about Hyuga?
In that case, why don't you talk to him directly?
He doesn't really talk about himself.
I don't want to make him mad.
You've got a point there.\nHe's not the type to prattle on about himself.
Yeah, I can see that happening...
Plus, he's not really the\ntype to talk about himself anyway.
Let's see, Hyuga... I first met him back in\nelementary school, but in the worst possible way.
We sort of bumped into each other at the dorm\ncafeteria, and then that jerk just slugged me\nout of nowhere.
But later, in our match, even though he was\nburnt out, he kept dragging himself back on\nto the field. He needed to win.
That drive... That's when I understood\nhis dedication, and how he saw the game.
After that, my anger at him turned\ninto wanting to face him again.
And then, at the finals of this year's Nationals,\nNankatsu vs. Toho...
It was the second half of overtime, and the clock\nwas running down. I thought Toho... HE might lose,\nand to my own surprise I started cheering for him.
It's bizarre. He went from the rudest jerk I\never met, to an opponent I respected, to finally\nsomeone I found myself rooting for.
It's like... I just couldn't take it anymore.\nSeeing him cornered and lose the will to fight...\nI didn't want him to go out that way.
Defeating Kojiro Hyuga was a mountain I'd so far\nfailed to summit. He wasn't allowed to back down\nlike a trained circus tiger.
He was supposed to fight tenaciously to the very\nend, to be hungrier for victory than anyone\nelse...
I know I was selfishly projecting my expectations\non to him, but I couldn't help it. I mean, I\nhadn't imagined his tenacity, had I?
And I wasn't the only one with that thought. He\nwas someone the whole country had thought could\ndefeat Tsubasa and Nankatsu.
Those expectations gave him strength. And he's\nalways been obsessed with the man-to-man battle.\nThat's what makes him compelling to watch.
It seems like you've been examining his moves,\nbut understand that he's more than just raw power.\nPay close attention to his attitude, too.
You want to ask me something?\nOf course, fire away.
You want to know about Hyuga? Why come to me then?\nCouldn't you just ask him?
Do you really think he'd answer?
Wouldn't he get angry?
Good point. I tried to talk to him once,\nand he just told me to scram.
Well, he did have a reason at the time.
That does sound like him, honestly.\nOne time I went to him home to talk to him,\nand he just told me to scram.
Well, he did have his reason at the time.
Hmm, let's see... The first time we faced each\nother was in the Tokyo Regional finals this\nsummer.
He wasn't as hungry to win back then, and\nlacked mental toughness. Hard as it is to say,\nhe wasn't much of a challenge back then.
But while I have no idea how it happened,\nby the time the National finals came around,\nhe was like a completely different person.
He really matured during that tournament.\nBoth physically and mentally.
This is just a guess, but I think he felt a need\nto live up to what those around him expected of\nhim.
The pressure at Nationals for him may've\nbeen even heavier than for Tsubasa, in a way.\nHe had to bear it watching from the sidelines.
Of all the Japanese middle school players who\nwanted to be beat Nankatsu and Tsubasa, Kojiro\nHyuga is the only one who stood a chance.
In fact, I went to see him and tell him so.\nI was just one of many people who was cheering\nfor him to dethrone the long-time champs.
Obviously he's skilled, but it was really more\nof a feeling. A gut feeling that he'd be able to\npull it off.
And then, this summer, he accepted that\nburden of so many people's hopes and enthusiasm.
It seems like you've been copying some of his\nmoves lately, but what you should be imitating\nisn't his play.
It's his spirit... His tenacity. The way he\ndraws supporters in with his attitude alone.
That's what you should take from him.
He's just that sorta guy.
A question for me? Sure, I don't mind.
Huh? You want to know about Hyuga?\nIt's a bit late to be asking now, isn't it?\nYou've seen him play quite a bit haven't you?
But what about what I might've missed?
But you've known him longer, right?
Something you may've missed...
Yeah, I've known him since elementary school.\nYou want me to talk about that?
Yeah, I guess.
Let's see... Should I talk about\nour time in elementary school then?
Have you heard about his family? Truth is his\ndad died in a car accident, leaving him, his mom,\ntwo little brothers, and a little sister.
To help out his family, he worked around town,\nwhile still playing soccer.\nIt only makes sense he always wants to win so bad.
In sixth grade, at the elementary school\nNationals, he was scouted by Toho Academy.
They said they'd give a scholarship to either\nhim or Tsubasa. Whoever won the championship...
Plus, if he got the scholarship they'd pay his\nwhole tuition all the way from middle school\nthrough high school.
Of course, when he heard that he thought about\nhow it might help his mom, and was desperate to\nget into Toho.
Of course, when he found out, he realized\nhow it might help his mom, and was desperate to\nget into Toho.
So when he got to the finals with Nankatsu SC,\nhe concentrated solely on beating Tsubasa.
Which is why he was obsessed with scoring\non Wakabayashi from outside the goal box.\nSomething that even Tsubasa couldn't do.
But Wakabayashi was better than he thought, and\nHyuga couldn't do it either, which put Meiwa in\na tough position.
But when the team was struggling, Hyuga overcame\nhis selfishness and helped the team win.
Taking shots from inside the goal box,\nscoring goals with tricky moves...\nSeeing him work like that really moved me.
He's been in plenty of other blood-pumping games,\ntoo. Playing until he dropped or seizing victory\nfrom the jaws of defeat. He's always been amazing.
Of course, he's also always been a little...\nviolent, rude, and stubborn.
But he's always thinking of his team. No one wants\nto win more than him, and he works harder than\nanyone. That's never changed.
As a player, I aim to be like Tsubasa, but I want\nto play FOR Hyuga. I want to celebrate victory by\nhis side.
I'm sure Wakashimazu feels the same. No one is\nmore worthy of respect, and that's what draws\npeople to him.
If you want to be like Hyuga, you have to do more\nthan copy his style of play. I'd love to see you\nbecome a man like him.
Er... maybe I went a little too far with\nthe praise. This is kinda embarrassing.\nDon't tell him I said all this. Promise me!
Ha! Ha! Ha! I can do better than that!
You here to practice too, <avatar_name>?
I want to be a man like you!
I'll do my best to be like you!
Wh-Where's this coming from?!
Wh-Where's this coming from?!
Takeshi said all that?
Jeez, you're making me blush...
But didn't he tell you not to tell me?\nSheesh, what're we gonna do with you?
Well, relax, I won't tell him I heard it from you.
So that's how he thinks of me...
Well, all I can do is my best, in my own way. What\nother people think of me ain't what I worry about.
But after hearing all that,\nI really can't slack off now, huh?
Okay <avatar_name>! Today, I'm doing special\ntraining! I can keep going until it's dark!
And if you really want to be like me,\nyou'd better keep up! Got it?!
Oh, come on!
Awesome! I'm open, pass it here!
I'll do it myself!
Follow me!
Wait! Watch out, <avatar_name>!
That's too reckless, <avatar_name>!
Yeah, Takeshi's right!
Tch! Why you little...
Lame! Did you really think you could get past me?
That's as far as you go, <avatar_name>!
This'll clinch it!
We'll win with this!
I'll stop it!
I'll shut it down!
I'm offended you thought you could\nbeat me with a shot like that.
Bwuh?!
Hya!
You can't just force a shot through like that,\n<avatar_name>!
Yeah.
Don't let it get to you, <avatar_name>!
(Something's off about his play today.\nHe's trying to do everything himself.\nSheesh... What happened?!)
(He's not playing well, today. It's like\nhe thinks he has to do everything himself.\nWhat happened to him?)
(What's wrong with you today, <avatar_name>?\nYou're trying to do too much by yourself.)
(Can't leave this guy alone for a minute...)
Hey! <avatar_name>!
About the way you were playing this afternoon...\nI think I know what was going on.
You were trying to draw everyone to you,\nmake them believe in you? Something like that?
But that's trying to force my own ideals on 'em.\nYou can't lead a team like that.
Listen up! You aren't alone on the field out\nthere. You succeed because of everyone else\nsupporting you. Don't forget that.
I remember doing that... spinning my own wheels\nby myself. I've personal experience, so\nbelieve what I'm telling you.
I never thought I'd hear that from you.
I was wrong... Thank you!
Really? Is it weird?
I just thought I saw my old self in you, so I had\nto say something. I learned to be better and so\ncan you.
Ha, I'm seldom so forthcoming...
But as long as you can admit your mistakes\nand fix 'em... You'll grow up fast.
Even if you strain yourself, as long as you play\nthe way that comes naturally to you,\neveryone else will follow.
You're already strong enough for that.\nI think so, anyway.
Trust me, <avatar_name>! Because I trust you, too!
We'll be the world's best together, as a team!
Looks like you've really made\nthe Tiger Shot your own, <avatar_name>.
I see you learned a powerful shot in order to\nscore more points, but that's not always the best\nway to help your team.
Of course, I understand the desire to score, but\nthose chances are fleeting, and they won't always\nbe obvious.
A striker has to be able to recognize all those\nopportunities, and that's when the Tiger Shot can\ncome in handy.
What I mean is, the speed of the Tiger Shot can\nbe used to pass right through the enemy defense.
I mean, it's just using the Tiger Shot as a pass,\nso you don't need special training or anything.\nJust remember that you have that option.
But don't forget that you're\naiming at your teammate, not the goalie!\nOverdo it and you'll hurt a friend!
Your dribbling is the same as ever, Kojiro.
You talkin' 'bout elementary school?\nI don't need any fancy zigzags; I just go\nstraight for the goal.
Yeah, I remember you plowing right\nthrough everyone and saying the same thing.
But I still haven't forgotten that feint you\nbusted out back at the elementary school finals.
Ah yeah, that. I remember that, too.
How could I forget? After you got me with that,\nyou turned the whole game around on us.
Not to mention, it went against your whole style.\nWhat a great trap. I'll never forget that feint.
That's called playing to win.
Hyuga's feint? Now, I'm really intrigued.
Since when could you use real technique?!
Hey now! It's... an old story. I like throwing\naround my strength, but what's really important\nis winning. That's... kinda the whole story.
Why you... you think I'm that big an idiot?
I admit it ain't my thing, but that's the basics\nof the basics. I know I wouldn't lose to anyone\nelse, anyway.
Yeah, it may not have been the most polished\nfeint, but I was stuck on the image of Kojiro\nwho approaches everything like a sledgehammer.
And more to the point, at that moment\nhe had this aura of thirsting for victory.\nI've grown pretty familiar with that aura.
Oh, I know Kojiro. <avatar_name> has almost\nthe same kind of head-on dribble as you.
How about you teach him the trick to that feint?
Sure, I guess... I could school you for a bit.
Listen well. A lot of opponents will try to take\nyou head-on, so they won't get blown away by a\npower dribble.
So...
When you do this, you gotta kinda throw your body.\nOnce you're past them, you'll lose your balance\na bit, but don't worry about that.
It doesn't matter how you look, what matters\nis that you got past them. The results.\nMake them scared of you.
Well, don't worry about it too much, but sometimes\nit'll be your best play. So keep it in mind for\nwhen the time comes.
Oh hey, <avatar_name>. Perfect timing.
I really felt like we were on the same page\nlast game. You get that feeling, too?
You too, Hyuga?
I knew it! We're an amazing duo!
I knew you would.
So you really did, huh?
It was a lot like when I play with Takeshi.\nWhich got me thinking...\nMaybe we can do a Twin Shot, too.
I gave Takeshi and Wakashimazu a holler, too,\nto get a little training together!
Gah... I was sure this would go better.\nGet it together, <avatar_name>! Keep up!
Looks like you're struggling with that Twin Shot.
It's getting dark. Should we call it a day?
No way! Next ball, Takeshi!
No way! We're letting too much effort go to waste!\nDo it!
Hyuga... Got it!
Here it comes!
Oh no! I sent it too high!
...!
That's it!
Wh-What the...?!
We did it! We did it, <avatar_name>!
Well, that was certainly a Twin Shot!\nYou did it, Hyuga!
You did great, too, <avatar_name>!
I screwed up the pass,\nbut all's well that ends well!
We had to improvise a little,\nbut that was definitely it!
Okay, we'll add that to our arsenal!\nWe're going to be world famous with this!
No doubt!
Yo, <avatar_name>. I thought I heard something.\nPracticing shooting on your own time? Nice.
But it's not just about the number of repetitions.\nI know you're a better player than that.
From what I can tell, you've done enough to build\nsome muscle memory. But you wanna represent Japan,\nright? We should talk.
Each of your individual shots is pretty good.\nOn average, you could say they're quite skilled.
But if you want to carry your team as the\ncaptain or its ace striker, that's not enough.
Please, tell me what I'm missing!
I thought my shots had plenty of power!
I suppose I can spare a moment for you.
That's good enough for now.\nIf you want a team that'll rely on you someday,\nyou need more than that.
This sounds interesting.\nCould I get in on this, too?
I've always wanted to hear the perspective\nof Kojiro Hyuga, the Fierce Tiger.
Sure, you're another of our forwards, too.\nUnclog those ears.
Well, basically, it's something I always\nkeep in mind, but it seems like you're not.
Your shots have power, sure, <avatar_name>\nbut there's no real impact to them. No drive.
Listen, if you try to use your usual shots\nin an important match against a tough rival,\nthere's no way you're scoring.
Back in the finals of Nationals this year,\nI was so sure my Tiger Shot would beat\nNankatsu and Tsubasa.
But from the start of the match,\nnothing went right.
Tsubasa somehow went beyond his limits, and Toho\nwas as good as done at the tail end of overtime.\nFrankly, I was prepared to lose.
But right then, my teammates desperate efforts\nmanaged to get me the ball.\nYou think I treated that chance like any other?
Like heck I did. How could I?!
At that moment, I put everything I had\ninto my right foot, and took the tying goal.
Well, it was all thanks to Takeshi, really.
You know what I mean, right Nitta? The same\nsort of thing happened in our match with France.
Sure do! I slung my leg into that\nball with everything I had.
Of course, I've gotta thank Urabe for that, too.
And you should.
Our teammates trust us with that ball. They\nthink that we'll manage to pull it off, somehow.
To an ace, there ain't nothing\nwe appreciate more than that.
Got it.
Our teammates trust us with that ball. They\nthink that we'll manage to pull it off, somehow.
To an ace, to a captain, there ain't\nnothing we appreciate more than that.
My point is, the most important moment of a match\nis when you can put all your hard work into the\nnext play or shot.
And it won't just be some random epiphany on the\nfield. You have to work every day to make those\nmoments happen.
It's something you can only do when you're ready\nto take on the fate of your team, with all your\nskill and confidence put into one last push.
Which means that someone who can't go above and\nbeyond at a time like that will never carry a\nteam.
I'm sure you two will have to bear the fate\nof your team someday. And it'll be tough.\nBut that's when this advice'll come in handy.
And when that time comes, I want you to give\nit your best with all your resolve and save\nyour team! Got it?
Loud and clear! Thank you!
Next year, you and Takeshi will\nhave to lead Toho Academy.
But even when it's looking bad, Takeshi and the\nrest of the team will create the opportunity you\nneed.
So you need to be ready to take it!
Someday you'll have to bear the fate of your team,\ntoo. And it'll be tough.\nBut that's when this advice'll come in handy.
And when your team has its back against the wall,\n<avatar_name> I want you to strike back!
Give them everything you have left!
I've been noticing this for a while now,\n<avatar_name>, but your passes have gotten\npretty accurate.
You always send 'em right where I need 'em\nat just the right time. It's been really great.
Never figured there'd be someone other\nthan Takeshi who knows me so well.
I know, how about we try out the same combo play\nme and Takeshi do? Bet you can handle it, too.
Okay, here it goes!
Yeah, that it's!
Wow, even better than I imagined!
You've grown so much, <avatar_name>,\nand right under my nose, too.
Because I've been watching you!
Because of your great example!
It's kinda embarrassing to hear\nyou say that, but...
It's more than that.\nIt's because of all your hard work. I can tell.
Our combo is good enough to be\nJapan's newest, shiniest weapon.
Okay! Let's take home this championship\nwith the power of the Toho duo!
Okay! Let's take home this win for Japan!
I'm counting on you, <avatar_name>!
Hyuga and <avatar_name>, huh...\nI thought they were gone, but they're still here?
But that teamwork was amazing...
Grrr... I can't fall behind! We may all be repping\nJapan now, but I'm still Hyuga's go-to man!
Alright, that's a good stopping point!
Gah! This isn't working!
Is that... Hyuga? So this is where\nhe disappeared to this morning.
Wow... Practicing on his day off.
Should we go join him?
Do you remember yesterday's practice,\n<avatar_name>?
Nah, we'd better not.\nI think he's working through some stuff.
Do you remember yesterday's practice,\n<avatar_name>?
Wakabayashi caught his Tiger Shot three times\nin a row. He didn't even hafta try that hard.\nThat must be why Hyuga's out here.
Like, "I'll get him next time for sure."\nThat sort of secret training.
He's always been like that. He's more determined\nthan anyone to win, and he'll put in whatever\neffort he needs to, to do it.
Me and the team have only made it this far because\nof him. Seeing him like that pulls us out of our\nfunk no matter how bad it gets.
When the going gets tough, he always\nmanages to dig deeper and save the day.
When the going gets tough, he gets even tougher,\nfinding in himself strength no one knew he had.\nI really respect that about him.
Watch him closely, <avatar_name>.
There's a reason they call him the Fierce Tiger.\nIt's that never-give-up, fighting spirit of his.
You feel something when you watch him, right? It's\nalmost like an ache... I can tell from your face.
Now, let's head down to the practice field, too.
There's no point if we can't keep up with him,\nis there? Zróbmy to!
Guess I wasn't wrong about you.\n<avatar_name>\nYou're just as good as I thought you were.
But don't you think you rely on too many cheap\ntricks? If you're good, you shouldn't need those.
Soccer's all about scoring points. And the best\nway to do that is to make a beeline for the goal.
Now, I'm gonna show you something,\nso watch me real close.
Once you've got the ball, charge straight in!\nDoesn't matter if other players stand in the way\nand you hafta fight. Push to the goal!
Got it?! Er... Sorry.\nDidn't mean to get so worked up.
All you need to do is smash through 'em with\nyour body. Use your momentum! Now you try it!
Nice one, <avatar_name>! I knew you could do it.\nWe won thanks to you!
Here, I figured you should have this,\nsince we won the tournament.
It's the medicine ball I used in training to\nupgrade my Tiger Shot to the Neo Tiger Shot.
It's not just a black ball. It's also three\ntimes heavier than a regulation soccer ball.
It takes way more effort to kick,\nand that beefs up your legs.
My old teacher, Coach Kira,\nsent it all the way to America.\nBut I've already gotten plenty of use out of it.
So now it's yours.
What you wanna do is keep on kicking it\nuntil you can manage a Tiger Shot with it.
That's when you'll know you're ready\nfor the Neo Tiger Shot.
Then, you use that power with a normal ball.
I guess I coulda given this to you back at school\nin Japan, but consider it a gift for winning the\nchampionship. Run it ragged for me, alright?
One more thing... I'd better see you use the Neo\nTiger Shot to take first place for Toho Academy\nnext year, got it?
I wasn't sure if I'd get a chance to hand it over\nback in Japan, but it's like a gift for winning\nthe championship. Run it ragged for me, alright?
Thanks! I'll catch up with you soon!
Don't get mad if I surpass you.
Yeah, looking forward to it. But I won't be\nstanding still gathering moss. I'm gonna be\nthe world's best striker!
By the time you catch up to where I am now,\nI'll be even further ahead. I'm gonna be the\nworld's most famous striker, after all.
This tournament was just a stepping stone for us,\n<avatar_name>. Let's keep on aiming even higher!
I had a feeling it'd come to this back<avatar_name>\nwhen you mastered the Neo Drive Shot.
If you can manage that, then...
We can pull off the Neo Tiger\nand Neo Drive Twin Shot together.
We'd be the ultimate team up.\nNo one could stop us.
We can't afford not to be ambitious.
What's up, <avatar_name>?\nDid you wanna ask us something?
Weird for you to get all serious on us,\nbut sure, ask away.
Huh. You wanna know about Hyuga?
Wouldn't it be faster to talk to him directly?
I don't think he'd tell me if I did.
Don't you think that'd set him off?
You're probably right.
Yeah, he's not really the kind to willingly talk\nabout himself.
True... Word it wrong and he might cuss you out.
Yeah, he doesn't strike me as the type to open up\nabout himself.
Alright, we'll tell you what we think about him.
You probably heard about this at the\nJunior Hero League.
We were up against Hyuga at the preliminaries\nfor elementary school Nationals and tied.
Yeah, but we at Meiwa FC did that to knock our\nrivals Nankatsu out of the prelims, since they\nwere the biggest hurdle to us winning.
Strats like that are pretty standard in soccer,\nbut weren't we just in elementary school?\nWould we normally go that far?
I guess not. Still, that's how bad he wanted\nto win that he pulled it off.
To us, what most defines Hyuga is that desire\nto win.
You can see that in how he went toe-to-toe with\nTsubasa and they ended up in a tie at Nationals\nthis year.
He wouldn't have done an overhead like that during\nthe very last bit of the finals otherwise. Plays\nlike those are inspired by that drive to win.
You wanna be like him, don't you, <avatar_name>?
Then don't just learn his plays.\nNote his fighting spirit that drives him to win.
So that’s how they thought of me?
(You're really going in hard on your own today,\n<avatar_name>. What's goin' on?)

















Ya look like ya got a question for me,\n<avatar_name>. Spit it out.
Ya wanna hear about Hyuga?
I wish I could help ya, but I ain't exactly that\nfamiliar with the guy.
Does he seem strong to you?
Oh? Thought he'd caught your attention.
Oh, absolutely. No doubt there.
You know how bad I was lookin' forward to facin'\noff against him in the Junior Hero League.
But hey, if ya want my opinion,\nI'm happy to share.
Well, ya ain't wrong.
I know you saw me sizing him up during the\nJunior Hero League.
Well, what the hay...
I'll give ya the skinny and what I picked up when\nwe played together as reps.
We didn't get to square off at Nationals,\nbut you don't run neck and neck with Tsubasa Ozora\nfor best in Japan without having real cred.
And he put his power on display in the finals when\nToho played Nankatsu.
The way I see it, Toho Academy had plenty of\nchances to win durin' that match...
But Hyuga was too focused on his own battles\nand not enough on his team winnin'.
They had many opportunities to get out ahead,\nparticularly in the second half.
Tsubasa was dead on his feet. Imagine what it\nmust take for someone like him to have his will\nstripped away like that.
If Hyuga had aimed his Tiger Shot at Nankatsu's\ngoal, that woulda been the end of it.
But he didn't. He aimed at Tsubasa, who was barely\na threat, so as to wake him up, get him back into\nthe game, and settle things fair and square.
That sparked a rare fire in my gut that day.
I could tell what he was feeling plain as day.\nIf his rival was gonna go out on an injury...
He was gonna use his own feet to settle accounts\nfirst. That was the vibe I got off of 'im.
Folks talk a bunch, but I know what he felt.\nIt's the same feelin' I get when I get a whiff of\na worthy opponent.
How did I get all that just from keeping an eye\non 'im?
Ain't it obvious? I spent years of my life seeking\nthe next tussle. I can smell the folks like me a\nmile off.
That said, much as I can relate, when it comes to\nsoccer, I can't do what he does.
We talked a lot when as teammates, and some of his\ntraining methods left me speechless.
My heart and soul are in this game,\nand I aim to be the best I can.\nStill, he showed me I had a ways to go.
Come to think of it, he's worked so hard this\nwhole time to beat Japan's best... Tsubasa...\nand this summer, he finally closed in.
More than likely, he put in more effort than\nanyone else to get there.
I gotta give it to him, not just for all his hard\nwork, but his fierce spirit and dedication to\nwinning.
You're way off if all you wanna learn from him is\nhis moves.
Make no mistake, his heart drives his game.\nIf you wanna learn from him,\ndon't overlook his mental fortitude.
Someday I'm gonna throw down with him and Tsubasa\nagain. And it's gonna be on the big stage.\nSome tournament, somewhere, someday...
(That <avatar_name>'s chargin' in hard today ain't\nhe? What's his deal?)

















You have something to ask me, <avatar_name>?
Sure, ask away.
You wanna know about Hyuga?
Well, sure, I guess. But why come to me?
I want to hear how you see him.
Because you're his rival.
How I see him, huh...?
If you mean what it's been like to go up against\nhim so many times, then I guess I can shed\nsome light.
I see. So that's it.
I mean, I've definitely gone up against him plenty\nof times. I could tell you what it's been like.
Let's see... You already saw our match\nin this year's Nationals, right?
I know, I'll start with the first time we played\neach other.
It was in the first match of the prelims\nfor the elementary school Nationals.\nNankatsu SC vs. Meiwa FC.
I'd already heard of him from Misaki, and he'd\neven came to our practice and scored a goal on\nWakabayashi.
But still, that was our first real match.\nAnd what a match.
He was already just as strong and tenacious as he\nis today, so saying he was a tough opponent would\nbe an understatement.
What sticks out to me most about that match,\nthough, was the showdown we had at the start.
He'd managed to goad me before the match,\nso without thinking I headed straight for him\nas soon as the whistle blew.
And we clashed with the ball right between us.
I felt this incredible tingling in my legs.\nIt was the first time in my life I'd felt that.
After, we kept locking horns no matter what\nwe were doing. Dribbling, shooting, whatever.\nWe were both too stubborn to back down.
In the end, we both scored, were scored on,\nand Nankatsu lost the match.\nIt was so frustrating I even cried.
But it was because Hyuga had beaten me\nthat the tears came.
...Or something like that.
Come to think of it, that first match is when I\nrealized just how hungry for victory Kojiro Hyuga\nreally was.
Maybe that's even when I started thinking of him\nas my rival.
There was definitely something there that can't\nbe put into words, that you can only understand\nby going head-to-head with him.
Hyuga's almost larger than life, both in skill\nand in his feelings about the game.
I hope that someday you'll grow into a player who\nhas as much of an effect on your opponents as he\ndoes.
I can't wait to see that.
*pant* *pant* I know can do better than that!
You here to practice too, <avatar_name>?
Please, have a serious duel with me!
I'm here to play you for real!
Wh-Where's this coming from?!
Wh-Where's this coming from?!
Oh, Tsubasa told you all that?
Something that can only be communicated\nin a real match?
Gotcha. Then we'll square off in earnest.\nJust once.
Here I come!
So, did ya get anything from that?
The gap in strength.
How much you hunger for victory.
I mean, I guess there's that, too.
But I know you're sharper than that.\nThat's not the only thing you noticed, right?
Good eye... You're pretty sharp.
...
Tsubasa told you about our first match, but the\nstory of that tournament doesn't end there.
We battled Nankatsu SC again in the finals.\nAnd in the very last moments of the match,\nsomething happened.
Me and Tsubasa were going head-to-head when\nhe managed to overpower me, steal a goal,\nand win the match.
Ever since then, I've been chasing him. I wanted\nto beat him no matter what. But I couldn't.\nAnd it hurt.
...And it wasn't because I was too weak or not\nskilled enough. It was because Toho pampered me.\nI wasn't that same hungry tiger anymore.
I only realized it when my old teacher from Meiwa\nFC pointed it out. So that summer I pushed myself\ninto a corner. I dug up my old self. And...
And in that final match, I was finally able to\nstand up to him again.
Strength and skill are important, duh, but what\nreally counts is that desire. "I need to win."\nI had to learn it all over again.
Actually, maybe that's why I lost to Tsubasa back\nin elementary school, too. He had more riding on\nthat rematch than I did.
Heh. This isn't like me.


(<avatar_name>... You've been coming straight for\nme on your own all day today. What's the deal?)



Show everyone how much you want to win\nand they'll follow you.
But I only do it for myself,\npushing my own ideals.
Don't be like me. Raw stubbornness ain't gonna\nlead a team.












What's the matter, <avatar_name>?\nYou got a question?
Go ahead, ask me anything.
Huh? You want to know about Hyuga?
Couldn't you just ask him yourself?
You think he'd answer　if I asked?
He might get angry if I ask...
I suppose not.
Yeah, I can see that happening...
Plus, he's not really the type\nto talk about himself, anyway.
I think I first met him at a\npractice match with Nankatsu SC.
He rushed into the middle of our game,\ntook the ball from us, and even scored a goal.\nHe then taunted us before leaving.
We went on to face him in the prelims\nand finals of the national tournament.\nHe was quite the opponent.
He scored so many goals against us I lost count.
His drive to win is fierce. It doesn't matter if\nwe're trying to clear the ball, he'll jump in full\nforce head first.
My drive is strong, too, but there's just\nsomething about Hyuga... He's different.
His skills are top notch, sure, but it's because\nof that ferocity that he could hold his own with\nTsubasa at Nationals.
It seems like you've been practicing his moves,\nbut understand that he's more than just raw power.
Behind his powerful plays is a\nfighting spirit hungry for victory.\nMake sure you learn from that, too.
Oh no!
Awesome! I'm open, pass it here!
I'll do it myself!
Follow me!
Wait! Watch out, <avatar_name>!
That's too reckless, <avatar_name>!
Yeah, Takeshi's right!
Tch! Why you little...
Lame! Did you really think you could get past me?
That's as far as you go, <avatar_name>!
This'll clinch it!
We'll win with this!
I'll shut it down!
I'll shut it down!
I'm offended you thought you could beat me with a\nshot like that.
Bwuh?!
Hya!
You can't just force a shot through like that,\n<avatar_name>!
Yeah.
Don't let it get to you, <avatar_name>!
(<avatar_name>, you're really going in\nhard on your own today. What's goin' on?)
(Can't leave this guy alone for a minute...)
Hey! <avatar_name>!
About the way you were playing this afternoon...\nI think I get what you were going for.
You were trying to draw everyone to you,\nmake them believe in you? Something like that?
But that's trying to force your own ideals on 'em.\nYou can't lead a team like that.
Listen up! You aren't alone on the field out\nthere. You succeed because of everyone else\nsupporting you. Don't forget that.
I remember doing that... spinning my own wheels\nby myself. Trust me. This is coming from\npersonal experience.
I never thought I'd hear that from you.
I was wrong... Thank you!
Really? Is it weird?
I just saw my old, good-for-nothing self in you,\nso I had to say something. I learned to be\nbetter and so can you.
Ha, I'm seldom so forthcoming...
But as long as you can admit your mistakes\nand fix 'em... You'll grow up fast.
Even if you strain yourself, as long as you play\nthe way that comes naturally to you,\neveryone else will follow.
You're already strong enough for that.\nI think so, anyway.
Trust me, <avatar_name>! Because I trust you, too!
We'll be the world's best together, as a team!







Haaah!
Gwah!
Now!
You're mine!
We'll see about that!
Drive it in there!
Hammer it home!























Captain!

I did it!
Wohoo!
I know how a keeper thinks!
I came here to win!
Don't take my skills lightly!
Don't get careless cuz I'm a keeper!
Hmph, how about that?!
I'll keep us safe, so you go win!
This lead is more than enough!
Sorry. Just... Keep it up!
C'mon! Just one more!
Ugh! My fault! Sorry!
I'll stop them even if it kills me!
Good work!
Nice!
Looking good!
That's not good!
Seriously?!
Set 'em up! Knock 'em down!
Nice pass!
Thanks!
Leave it to me!
Get in there!
C'mon!
Over here!
I'm open!
Pass it!
Not while I'm around!
Not today!
No way, no how!
You thought it'd be that easy, Tsubasa?!
Not bad, Hyuga! That's got some flair to it!
Learned this in France, did you Misaki?
It's a good start, at least!
I'd expect no less, Misugi.
Cool idea, but it won't work on me!
You'll need more than that, Nitta!
Gonna need a sharper curve, Soda!
I won't lose to you, Schneider!
Didn't know you could shoot like that!
That's right, don't even bother, Heine!
I see right through your tricks, Pierre!
Nice power and spin, Napoleon!
That's got some oomph, Kluivoort!
You can't take me, Rusciano!
Just what I'd expect from Brazil!
You'll need more than that, Alberto!
You're not getting by me, Diaz!
Huh... The Black Panther...
Not enough power, Senghor.
You don't have the chops, Diallo!
So that's Ryan? That was close.
Power alone can't stand up to me!
A game! We're in for a real match!
We're going for 50 points this match!
You have a 0% chance of victory!
As if a simple plan like that'd work!
I'm Wakabayashi! Remember the name!
Get on it, <avatar_name>!
I hope you don't expect much with that weak of a\ncombination.
Dang it... I lost my calm.
<avatar_name>, Ishizaki. Don't you think you were\na bit sluggish during the practice match?
Aww, cut us some slack.
It's nerve-racking having to play against you,\neven in practice matches.
No matter how much I try\nit's never enough.
You always get mad at us after practice.
See? <avatar_name> gets it.
I had to play against you a couple times back in\nelementary school when Nankatsu played Shutetsu.
I don't know if it's how you move or the vibe you\ngive off, but it's hard to figure out how to score\non you.
I can totally see why even Tsubasa and Hyuga have\ntrouble scoring on you.
Whoa now, good luck getting a shot in on the\nworld's toughest teams talking like that.
Really? Why would you think that?
I mean, sure, I'll get mad if you're not\ntaking things seriously and getting sloppy,\nbut I'm not some lit powder keg.
Ha! Fair enough. Still, feels like we get\nchewed out for one thing or another.
Don't try me, Ishizaki.
Anyway! When you're on the opposing team, you\nput on this pressure that makes it hard to move.
Pressure, huh?
What's up? You seem to be thinking on something.
What you said just gave me an idea.
We're playing together next practice match, right?\nI wanna try something. Can I count on you?
Time for a practice match. The other team's got\nWakabayashi, so look alive out there!
It's on! Leave the defense to me!
Let's steal the ball, and funnel it to Tsubasa\nand the forwards, and score on him somehow.
Hope you're ready for this, Wakabayashi!
Bring it, bucko! I'm not letting even a mosquito\nget in this goal!
Yeesh!
You're intense!
I'm ready for every shot they could even think of!\nYou guys just worry about offense!
The match has barely started but he's already\nputting on some ridiculous pressure on us.
Guys! Don't let his energy get to you!
Wide open, Tsubasa!
Drat!
Here! You know what to do!
We're in trouble. They're countering!
What the...?!
Don't lose your heads! Stay cool and regroup!
You really did us in, Wakabayashi.
Yeah, big time.
You started off driving your side so hard that\nwe couldn't match your pace.
Yeah, during the first half, it was hard for us\nto play our game and use our strategies.\nWas that your plan?
Ishizaki and <avatar_name> gave me an idea after\nan earlier practice match.
They said they feel a pressure that makes it hard\nto play when they're up against me in goal.
So, I figured if I pump myself up and be loud from\nthe kickoff, I can cause the opponent to shrink\nback, even if only for a bit.
Heh! And it worked like a charm!
That's nuts.\nI can't imagine anyone else doing that.
Yeah, you're incredible, Wakabayashi!
I'm just glad I was able to make it work.
So, uh, guys...
What?
I got you off your game just by dialing up\nmy intensity. Am I... really that scary?
Haha, are you worried about that?
I will say you left quite the impression when\nwe first met together to be representatives for\nJapan.
Oh...
Not to mention, that time being the first we met.
S-Sorry about that...
Forget about it. Everyone on the team knew you'd\nchosen to step into an unpopular role to help at\nthe time.
Look at how we get on now.\nNo one holds it against you.
I know sometimes we can give you a bit of a hard\ntime, but I don't think anyone actually thinks\nyou're a boogie man.
Granted, you as a goalie... that's another story.
So, it's when I'm playing keeper that I'm scary?\nYou're not just saying that to be nice, are you\nTsubasa?
We couldn't ask for a more dependable teammate.\nKeep it up.
You got it. I'll make Japan's goal impenetrable!
Hey, <avatar_name>. When it comes to sheer\ndetermination, you're not far behind me.
Try putting the pressure on when matches start.\nYou might be able to throw the opponent off, too!
Hey, Tsubasa. Wanna have\na little contest during the break?
Sure! You're on!
I'll shut you down with the skills\nI learned in Germany!
Oh, I'm comin' for ya, Wakabayashi!
Heh heh, Tsubasa versus Wakabayashi, eh?
I was there for their very first match,\nbut looking back, that feels like a\nhistoric moment for Japanese soccer.
You'd better remember this moment, too...\nWait, where're you going?!
Impressive.\nLooks like your time in Germany was well spent.
You're not bad yourself.\nYou must've had some great rivals in Japan.\nYou've improved more than I expected.
I wanna try too, Wakabayashi!
Show us how they train in Germany!
A contest between me and you?
I don't think you're ready for that yet.
German training?
You're interested in that stuff, too?
Okay, break time's over! Get back to practice!
Either way, doesn't look\nlike we'll be able to now.
Ask me again when we're free sometime.\nWe should focus on practice for now.
You haven't been slacking off,\nhave you, <avatar_name>?
Doesn't mean much if there's no goalie.\nI'll take over as keeper.
C'mon, don't be shy. Keep 'em coming!
Hmm... I can tell you've been working hard,\nbut you've still got a ways to go.
You're surrounded by the best of the best from\nJapan. Keep nipping at their heels and you'll\nbe there in no time.
Do you train hard, too, Wakabayashi?
I thought I was a prodigy...
Obviously. Talent means nothing\nif you don't train to develop it.
Ha ha, it's great to have confidence,\nbut even a prodigy needs to develop their\ntalent or it goes to waste.
I've been doing focused goalie\ntraining ever since elementary school.
The team's current coach, Mr. Mikami,\neven used to be my personal trainer.
Man he was strict.\nAt times, I wanted to give up, and he scolded me.
But even after I graduated elementary school\nand moved to Germany, he came with me.\nI owe him a sincere debt of gratitude.
We lived together in Germany. It was fun.\nHe was like my dad.
Whoops, I'm getting off track here.\nI was trying to tell you to work harder.
I can tell you have talent, but more importantly\nyou love soccer. And that's what counts.
Hyuga! Is that all you've learned in the last\nthree years? What happened to those claws you\nhad when we were younger?
You're questioning ME?!
I mean, was that your best shot? You want to be\nthe world's best striker with that? What a joke!
I've caught shots that were ten times stronger\nthan that! Don't tell me that's all you got!
Grr! Just you watch, Wakabayashi!\nYou won't know what hit ya next time!
What is it, <avatar_name>?
I think you went too far just now.
You didn't have to say it like that.
C'mon, do you really think Hyuga would\nlet a little jab like that get to him?
If that was enough to wreck his spirit,\nhe'd never have made it here in the first place.
If you're gonna fight on the world stage, you need\nto be able to take your frustration and use it as\nfuel to improve.
It's not like it was all sunshine and rainbows in\nGermany, either. I wouldn't have survived without\nan unbreakable spirit of my own.
I even got in trouble for getting into\na fight with the team's regular keeper.
And then I beat 'em all one-on-one.
I can laugh about it now, but I heard Mr. Mikami\ngot chewed out by the team at the time,\nas my guardian. It was bad.
What was I saying again? Oh yeah, when Japanese\nplayers run headfirst into the wall that is the\nREST OF THE WORLD, don't give up and keep at it.
Still, you've done pretty well.\nI can tell you've made steady growth.
Why am I praising you? Simple.
While Hyuga needed a little riling up, you\nseem like the type who responds well to praise.
Keep at it, buddy!
Jeez... You're quite the guy!\nEven after all that work, you're still going?
I can see why you've been doing\nso well in matches lately.
If you're that hard a worker, you might get a\nlot out of studying abroad. Ever thought about it?
I mean, it's not too late.
Yes, I'm really interested in it!
No, I want to stay in Japan.
Oh, really? Good to hear.
Yeah, figures. It's not like you can't work\nhard at home, too. That's a valid choice.
Earlier, I mentioned the problems I had in\nGermany, but I have plenty of good memories there,\nas well.
After Mr. Mikami finished his coach training and\nwent back to Japan, I stayed with the Draksler\nfamily. They took good care of me.
I could still barely speak German, but they taught\nme. They also kept me fed during my growth spurt,\nand even cheered me on in matches.
It was only one year,\nbut they feel like my German family.
After I got used to speaking German,\nI got along a lot better with the team, too.\nSchneider, Kaltz... They're all my friends.
If this tournament had been held in France like it\nwas supposed to be, maybe the Drakslers would've\nbeen here to cheer me on.
I'm really glad I got a chance to study abroad.
Experiencing foreign cultures, meeting\nincredible players... It really opened my eyes.
I mean, no offense to Japan.\nIt's great there, too.
Even if Tsubasa heads to Brazil, you've still\ngot Hyuga and Matsuyama and Misugi and all them.\nThere are so many great players there.
And you've got a lot to gain\nfrom competing with them.
But if you're interested in putting in some work\noverseas, you can always talk to me about it.\nAsk me anything.
That's Schneider for you... Hmm...\nHow would I stop that?
Still practicing, <avatar_name>?\nSorry, bit of an awkward moment.
What's that video you're watching?
Gaming while talking to yourself?
A soccer video, obviously. I was reviewing\nSchneider's play from this tournament.\nAs always, he's incredible.
I-Is that what it looked like?\nNo, I was reviewing a soccer video.\nIt's Schneider, from this tournament.
I... used to be his teammate in Germany.\nBut he's also my biggest rival.
I mean, I can call him a rival now, but when\nI first met him he seriously outclassed me.
One day I stood against dozens of his shots.
At first, I couldn't even touch any of them except\nthe ones aimed at my face. That's when I realized\njust how big of a skill gap there was overseas.
So my first milestone was\nto stop one of his shots.
I spent days focusing on that in my training.\nAnd since he was willing to tag along,\nI learned all sorts of things.
That's how I was able to\nimprove so rapidly in Germany.
Now, I have about a 50/50 chance of stopping\none of his shots from outside the goal box.
He's the only person with that high a scoring rate\nfrom outside the goal box, but I'm also the only\nperson with that high of a rate of stopping him.
We're almost evenly matched.\nThat's why we promised to settle things here,\nin this tournament.
To be honest...\nI've never faced him in a real match.
So being able to go up against Germany\nin the finals seems like fate!
I've already done my research and hyped myself up.\nI'm ready to settle things with Schneider and\nlead us to victory!
Luckily, Germany's been doing well, too, and is\nstill in. If we both win our matches, we can meet\nin the finals, which would be just perfect.
I can't wait... but we also need\nto prep ourselves so we'll be sure to win.
Too bad Germany already lost, though... And\nSchneider was doing so well, too. Just goes to\nshow that you never know what'll happen in soccer.
But now that's it's come to this,\nI've gotta win for them and for us!
I'm counting on you, <avatar_name>!
You're already a pillar of the team.
I'm sure you'll be carrying the fate of Japan on\nyour shoulders soon enough.\nI've got high hopes for you!
Let's both do our best to make sure we take home\nthis title!
Over here, Tsubasa!
It's all on you, Hyuga!
Alright! Got it!
Nice pass, Tsubasa!
Nice shot, Hyuga!
It's always good for team morale to see the key\nplayers doing well.
Does that only apply on offense?
A good defense could work, too...
No, I wouldn't say that.\nI'm the goalie, but if I made a great save I'm\nsure that'd inspire the team.
Yeah, of course. It's not like the defense can't\nhave key players, as well.
Seeing a great play on defense makes the other\nplayers want to help out down the line.
I mean, to a guy on offense, the guy in charge of\nthe midfield is part of the defense, too, right?
You should keep that in mind and try to raise\nmorale from the back. I'll be cheering for you!
Hey, <avatar_name>, you sure you're not lying\nabout your age?
Of course not.
How'd you find out?!
Just kidding. I mean, you're so calm out there.
What?!
Ha! I didn't expect you to play along.
It's just, when you're on the field you're as\ncalm as a more experienced player.
Especially when tackling.\nYou seem so dependable when you're really\ndiving in. I feel I can trust you.
It's weird to say this about a first year, but\nit's like watching a skilled artisan at work.
I'd hate to be one of those weaker players eating\none of your tackles. That's gotta hurt.
As a keeper, I'm grateful for all the pressure\nyou put on the opposing offense.
I'm expecting great things from you!
I've been the best goalie in Japan for three\nyears now, Wakabayashi! I'm not handing over the\ntitle of Guardian Angel without a fight!
Heh, that's a challenge I'm up for.\nI don't plan on losing, Wakashimazu.
Guardian Angel sounds so cool!
Is that a goalie only thing?
What, you're fighting for it, too?\nI mean, it's normally for keepers, but...
Yeah, pretty much.\nBecause they're in the back, they're the final\nline of defense watching over the team.
Don't tell me you want that title, too?
But if you think of it as the guy who protects\nthe team in a pinch, I guess anyone on defense\ncould earn it.
And a "pinch" would mean an opponent's shot from\ninside the goal box?
Yeah, I'd say so.
Okay, <avatar_name>, if you want to be called a\nGuardian Angel you'll have to earn it!\nWe're gonna work on blocking!
Me and Wakashimazu may be goalies, but we're\nconfident in our kicks, too. We'll be more than\nenough to polish up your skills a bit.
Don't forget to stay on edge, like it's a real\nmatch. There's no point in the training if you\ndon't.
Okay, if you're ready, then let's get started! If\nyou can't handle this, then no way do you deserve\nto be called a Guardian Angel!
Nice, <avatar_name>!\nYou're getting the hang of it!
Yeah. I guess we can sit back and leave things to\nyou now.
You make a fine Guardian Angel!\nBut even if you screw up, don't worry, you've got\ntwo more right behind you!

Way to go, dudes! We did it!
Tak! We can't lose!
Are you watching, Father?
We'll win no matter what it takes!
There's no way we'll lose!
Now you've faced my full might!
Keep it up and we can turn it around!
Stay focused and win this!
Hype it up! Zróbmy to!
Don't worry. We're still tied.
Don't panic! We're still in the lead.
Let's take this one step at a time.
Right on!
Awesome!
Outta sight!
This is bad!
For real?!
Someone stop them!
Nice pass!
Got it!
Trust me!
Push it!
Bring it!
Here!
Over here!
Pass! Pass!
This is it!
Now or never!
Make it!
I can do this!
I can make it!
This one's mine!
This is it! Go!
Alright!
Here's a winner!
My turn!
This is the one!
This is the one!
I can do this!
I can do this!
Go! GO!
Twin Shot!
High five, Tsubasa!
Yeah, we did it!
I know your plays best, Tsubasa!
You're amazing, Tsubasa! Y'know that?
I won't lose, Kojiro! Not to you!
As fierce as ever, Kojiro.
I've been working hard, too, Matsuyama!
Hard work really pays off!
You're better than this, Misugi!
Perfect play as always, Misugi.
Looks like I'm better, Masao!
You've made some good progress, Masao!
Looks like I got you beat, Kazuo!
You've really improved, Kazuo!
Remember, Nitta, I came before you!
You've earned your rep, Nitta!
I may be smaller, but I still win!
Gah, you're just too strong!
That won't work on me, Soda!
The Ace Killer, huh? Spooky.
You've got a long way to go, Ishizaki!
You've got guts, Ishizaki.
I can hold my own, Schneider!
Ugh! You're good, Schneider.
Don't look down on me, Heine!
You're not bad when you're serious!
I win this time, Pierre!
I'll be back, Pierre!
It won't be that easy, Napoleon!
Ugh. And I thought knew what to expect.
I won't just roll over for you, Jean!
So that's why Pierre has his eye on you.
It'll go the same next time, Kluivoort!
Is he that much better than me?
Don't belittle me, Rusciano!
Ugh, what a fearsome opponent.
Even Carlos can't trip me up!
Ugh! One on one with Carlos was too much.
I'm in this to win it, too, Diaz!
Ugh, this guy's like another Tsubasa.
I'll take you on anytime, Victorino!
So Victorino's more than just fast...
You won't beat me like that, Senghor.
Whoa, that technique is something else!
And I'll win next time, too, Ryan!
Could even Tsubasa take this guy on?!
You won't win with brute force, Blake.
This guy hits even harder than Kojiro!
I'm Taro Misaki. Nice to meet you!
I can hold up my end with everyone.
No choice but to go all in!
Watch over me, Father.
No way... No way am I losing!
Junior Youth World Challenge Preliminaries,\nBlock B, France vs. England
You think you can stop me?
You're up, Napoleon!
Heh, have a taste of THIS!
Japanese Practice Area the following day...
(Even after reviewing the footage,\neverything's fantastic for France.)
(Pierre and Napoleon's play is way more relaxed\nthan when I saw them in France.)
(And the reason for that is...)
Don't think this is over yet!
Try as much as you like, it's useless!
Gah, this guy again!
(Because Jean's there.)
(With their defensive weaknesses taken care of,\nthey can commit themselves entirely to offense,\ngreatly improving the team overall.)
(Now that I think about it, even in Japan there's\nTsubasa, Kojiro, Misugi, the Tachibana Bros,\nNitta, Takeshi...)
(And plenty of other offensive talent.)
(I wouldn't say our defense is weak exactly, but\nif I could take the ball in midfield as easily as\nJean can...)
(Then wouldn't our matches play out downfield,\nwith the rest of the guys able to bring the heat\non offense?)
(Tsubasa's on the other team in today's practice\nmatch, so it might be tough if they take control\nof midfield.)
...
(Okay, here we go.)
Coach, do you have a minute?
What's the matter, Misaki?
Do you think I could switch positions with Izawa\nfor this practice match? I want to try playing\nfrom the bottom of the midfield.
So you've come up with something?
Well, actually...
...So if I can pull this off,\nI think it'll help out the whole team.
Okay, that makes sense.
All right then, give it a shot.\nTry out whatever you like.
Cool! Thanks!
(Today, I'll control midfield by emphasizing\ndefense. I'll show 'em that we can even take down\na team led by Tsubasa!)
I'd say that match went pretty well.
Yeah, since I was able to keep Tsubasa in check\nfarther up the field, it worked out great for us.
Yeah, you weren't giving me space to dribble out\nthere, Misaki. That threw my whole game off.
I was sort of trying out a new strategy.\nBut if you think it was effective too,\nthen it may really be worth putting to use.
(But focusing so much on defense,\nI felt like I lost a step on offense.)
(I'm not sure what to think about that...\nI wonder who would have good insights.)
I see... So you came to me?
Yeah.
When I consider today's results, playing\ndefensively in the midfield is definitely\na good option.
Yeah, I got that impression.
But I think it'd tough to try to keep someone of\nTsubasa's level in check while keeping up my usual\nparticipation on offense.
If anything, it felt like I was restricted in what\nI could do.
Hmm, true.
Let me think... In that case, isn't it better to\ncommit yourself to a role?
What?
I've got a good grasp on this from playing defense\nmyself, but you can expect each of the\ninternational teams to have a Tsubasa-tier ace.
And if you want to go up against an ace like that\nand succeed, I think you should be giving defense\nyour undivided attention.
I see.
Well, with instincts like yours maybe you could\nmanage handling both.
You're overestimating me.
(So I need to pick a lane, huh?)
Either way, having experience in a number of\ndifferent roles will definitely come in handy\ndown the line.
Practically speaking, I feel like playing defense\nexpanded both my mindset and my range of play.
So it can pay off later? Thanks, Matsuyama.
Junior Youth World Challenge Quarterfinals,\nFrance vs. Uruguay
Dribbling's not the only trick up my sleeve!\nI'll open up that goal with THIS!
Im-Impossible!
So that's all you've got? How disappointing.
Japanese Practice Area the following day...
(I knew learning from Jean's defense was a good\nidea.)
(I guess I'm incorporating French soccer into my\nown playstyle, but I think it suits me.)
(Besides, I'm only just starting to get a handle\non my own style of defense.)
(Okay, today I'll...)
I see, so you're playing a little more defensively\ntoday.
Yeah, so I'm leaving the offense to you, Tsubasa.
Yeah, let's both give it our all!
(In today's practice match we're up against\nKojiro, Matsuyama, Nitta, and Misugi.\nAll players who use long shots.)
(And on our side, we've got Soda, who's great at\ngoing toe-to-toe. I can leave things to him if\nthey push deep.)
(So I think I'll focus on blocking today to\nprepare for my next match with Pierre or\nNapoleon.)
(Besides, I've got Wakashimazu behind me, so I can\nfocus completely on blocking their long shots!)
(I'll commit myself to a role,\njust like Matsuyama said!)
It was way easier to defend today, thanks to you\nblocking all those shots, Misaki.
Because of that, we had no choice but to push in\ndeeper, where we got caught up in your web, Soda.
Heh, that's what you get for trespassing in my\nterritory.
It seems like you've gotten a lot better with\nregards to what we discussed before, Misaki.
Right, I thought I could leave everything in front\nof the midfield to Tsubasa and the rest.
I'm feeling pretty confident from today's results.
(In our next match with France, I'll keep Pierre\nin check using all the defensive skills I've been\nhoning.)
(As long as I can keep him in check, Tsubasa will\nbe able to control the midfield, which should give\nus a chance to slip past Jean.)
(Still... Despite what Matsuyama said, France is\ndefinitely no pushover. I'll need to join in on\noffense too if I see an opening.)
(I've done a ton of prep work for a showdown with\nPierre on offense, after all. It'd be a shame not\nto test my strength.)
(Maybe it'll turn out to be a stalemate,\nbut when you consider the rest of the team...)
(No, I shouldn't overthink this. All I have to do\nis give it what I've got in our next match with\nFrance.)
Junior Youth World Challenge Semifinals,\nJapan vs. France
Here I come, Misaki!
My defense will hold you!
Ugh...
(That tackle... Could it be?!)
Japanese Practice Area the following day...
(Japan managed to win our match with France\nyesterday, and my showdown with Pierre didn't\ngo too badly either.)
(But... I wasn't able to stop him with the\ndefensive skillset I've been polishing.)
(I'm sure my defensive techniques need work, but\nmostly I was too frazzled splitting my attention\nbetween offense and defense.)
(But I've put so much effort into this playstyle\nthat I want to keep at it.)
(In order to fill in my gaps and really make this\nstyle work...)
(I'll steal techniques from Jean!)
(So is this the French practice area?)
(I mean, even that rookie's been visiting each\ncountry to learn skills and strategies from other\nplayers.)
(So someone like me who's played soccer around the\nworld should learn from his example!)
You're... Misaki from Japan, right?
Do you have business with Pierre? I'll go get him.
Uh, no, I'm here to see you today.
Me?
Well, you see...
I gotcha... So that's why you're here.
But I'll have to refuse.
Wha--?
No offense, but I barely know you.
What did you expect from barging in and asking a\ncomplete stranger to teach you his moves?
B-But that's...
Sorry, but I'm busy. I have to figure out exactly\nwhy we lost to Japan, so we can learn from our\nmistakes.
And you've got the finals coming up too, don't\nyou? I doubt you have time to waste on this\neither.
Ah, no, um...
I was sure you'd come, Misaki.
Pierre...
After yesterday's match, I got the feeling\nyou were basing your play on Jean's defense.
So you noticed. Of course, you would.
But I could tell it was still incomplete.\nSo you came here to master it, right?
Exactly.
But Jean's right. We hardly know each other,\nso it was pretty brazen of me to suddenly show up\nasking him to teach me his secrets.
...
Jean, could you coach Misaki?
Wha--?
Pierre...
Since Japan beat us, obviously we'd like to see\nthem win in the finals, too.
And if they want to stop Schneider or Heine, your\ndefensive techniques are sure to come in handy.
So... please?
...
Fine. If that's what you want, Pierre, then who am\nI to refuse? I'll teach him what I can.
But no matter how good you are, my techniques\naren't easy. I doubt you'll be able to master\nthem.
Jean... Thank you!
But there's something I should say to you first,\nMisaki.
In yesterday's match, you were playing on offense\nlike usual, right?
What I do isn't possible without committing to\ndefense. You need to be prepared to change your\nplaystyle.
I definitely realized that during yesterday's\nmatch.
There's no point in doing something\nif I'm not doing it wholeheartedly.\nThat's exactly why I came here to talk to you.
If you understand that, then fine, we'll begin\nright away. Starting with tackles...
...I'm amazed you kept up so far. I guess that's\nwhy Pierre thinks you're worth the trouble.
I'm the one who's amazed. Your skills never cease\nto impress.
No need to sing my praises. I know I'm good.
Sorry if this is a bit sudden, but could you come\nback with all the Japanese players, Misaki?
Huh?
There's no better way to polish up the skills you\nlearned from Jean than in a real match.
Isn't that right, Jean?
Yeah, a match is the best kind of practice.
And as the one who helped teach you,\nI have a duty to make sure things pan out right.
Pierre... Jean... Thank you.
One sec, I'll get everyone together!
Thanks for all coming together on such short\nnotice, guys.
Don't worry about it.\nIf you ever need help, just say the word.
And we get to play against France two days in a\nrow? Sign me up.
All right, let's get started!
Misaki, use your new techniques to try and stop\nme!
You did it, Misaki!
Yeah, I managed to put everything I learned to\nwork on the field.
Magnifique! I came at you with everything I had,\nbut you got me good.
Sheesh... You learned a lot in such a short time.
If you can defend the midfield this well, Tsubasa\nand Hyuga will soar even higher on offense.
Thanks, Pierre. Hearing that from you makes it all\nworth it.
But don't think I won't learn to break your\ndefense before we meet on the field again.\nIt'll be a grand time.
Yeah, I can't wait!
Seriously though Jean, thanks for everything.
I only taught you a few of my tricks and how I\nthink. You were able to learn because of your\ntalent and hard work.
Ha ha... But as expected, it'd be difficult to\nkeep this up while playing my usual offense.
If you're able to use this stuff and go on\noffense, then that's not anything you got from me.\nThat's all you.
Good luck in the finals. Misaki.
Thanks. We're winning this thing for sure!
(I've met so many people, and they've all been so\nsupportive.)
(So I need to support them too,\nand give them a game they'll never forget.)
(I'll trust in Tsubasa and my other teammates,\nand dedicate myself to winning this thing!)
(We'll win the Junior Youth World Challenge!)
We really showed up on offense and defense in that\nlast practice match, didn't we?
Yeah, felt like everything was moving like\nclockwork. I hope we can keep that up.
Me, too. It's hard work.
What are you watching there, Misugi?
A recording of our last practice match.\nI wanted to get a closer look at Misaki's plays.
He's impressive as always. He's got something\ndifferent about him than you or me.
Really looking close at him made me realize that\nall over again.
So what did you realize exactly?
Misaki's amazing! Duh!
He's always working to balance the team in the\nmiddle of the match. It's incredible how often\nhe gets it right.
Obviously. But I'm pretty sure he meant something\nmore specific.
So what part of his play were you impressed by?
It's way he's always trying to balance the team in\nthe middle of the match. I mean, it's impressive.
Misaki's always been a mobile player, but he's not\na ping pong ball just bouncing around.
He's performing whatever role the team needs him\nto... moment to moment.
You've got a point. Misaki has a huge repertoire\nof plays up his sleeve.
Passing or dribbling from the midfield is a given,\nbut he's always heading to wherever people need\nsupport, too.
When on offense he never misses a chance for\na quick shot.
And when the opponent takes the ball, he rushes\nback to our side and defends as hard as anyone.
I can't even count the times he saved our skin in\nelementary school.
Tak! He has excellent instincts and tries to fill\nin anywhere the team struggles.
It's like he doesn't focus on one job but flexes\nto help the team. You can't replace the guy who\ncan replace anyone.
Thinking about it, even back when he first joined\nNankatsu, he fit in right away and helped out a\nlot.
Right. And when Musashi FC played against Nankatsu\nFC, I knew Misaki was a key player and marked him,\nbut...
He still managed to break our offside trip, score\na tie-making goal, and support his team's offense\nand defense.
He's the one who taught me just how complex\nand deep this game could be.
It's been a long time since then, but I'm glad to\nsee he hasn't changed. He's such a strong player.
You base a lot of your plays on him,\ndon't you <avatar_name>?
So you should try to study his mindset\nand versatility, too!
Good work in practice today, <avatar_name>.
Something you wanna know?
Oh, I see. If that's what Tsubasa said,\nthen maybe I can help.
What do you think about when playing?
Why do you try to do so many things?
Huh, well... That's a toughie.\nI don't really think at all.
I guess I just do what I can to help the team win.\nDon't really care about being the best.
Now that I put it into words, that seems pretty\nobvious, huh? Winning is what matters to me.
What?
How do I put this
I do what I do because I want the team to win.
Now that I put it into words, that seems pretty\nobvious, huh? Winning is what matters to me.
I've told you before, but back in elementary\nschool, I used to move around a lot. I would never\nstay at the same school for very long.
So every time I played, I felt it might be the\nlast time I played soccer with that school.
Which made me want to make that game a highlight\nin what people thought about soccer and me.
If it was our last game together, obviously\nI'd want to end it on good terms, right?\nDon't you agree?
It's the same for me now, at this tournament.
Once this is over, I'll be going back to France\nand be estranged from all my Japanese friends\nagain.
So I want to spend more time with them,\neven if it's just one game more.
Which means we need to win. I'll do whatever it\ntakes to win. It really is that simple.
Aren't you here talking to me because you're\nfighting as hard as you can too, <avatar_name>?
Exactly. So if you want to go play-by-play and ask\nme about anything I did, I'll share everything.
Let's both make this a tournament to remember!
Huh, so you used to live in Osaka, too, Misaki?
Yeah, I've also spent time in Chiba, Fukuoka,\nHokkaido, Saitama... Pretty much all over Japan.
Sounds rough.
But thanks to soccer, no matter where\nI went I could always make friends.
Whoa, I'm impressed!
Makes sense. It was like that for the All-Japan\nteam, too, huh? You just fit in right away.
It's because everyone shares the same love of\nsoccer, no matter who or where they are.
That makes sense...\nWhoops, it's about time for me to head back.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Hey there, <avatar_name>. We should head back\nsoon, too. Wouldn't want to catch a cold.
Have you transferred schools a lot?
Weren't you from Nankatsu?
Oh, you overheard us?
Yeah, I've moved around all over the place\nbecause of my dad's work.
Oh, I transferred to Nankatsu in sixth grade, but\nit's not like I grew up there.
My dad's work forced us to move around a lot when\nI was in elementary school.
But no matter where we went, I could always play\nsoccer. And thanks to that, I've met so many\npeople.
Including you.\nI hope we can be great friends, <avatar_name>.
It's been so long since we could play together\nlike this, Misaki.
Not since we were on the same team in elementary\nschool, right?
Yeah... I wish you could've stayed\nwith Furano Elementary back then.\nMaybe we would've even been champs.
Ha! I'm glad you think so.
And then, after we took home the championship,\nthey'd be calling us the Furano Golden Duo.\nIt would've been great...
Hey! Got a second, Matsuyama?
Coming!
Sorry Misaki, gotta go.\nTell me all about France later.
Hey there, <avatar_name>.\nGood work in today's practice.
So, are you used to the team yet?
You were on Matsuyama's team, too?
You lived in Hokkaido, too?
Yeah, when I was living in Hokkaido.\nHe's such a great friend; we stayed in touch even\nafter I moved.
Yeah, I transferred there in elementary school.\nThat's when I was teammates with Matsuyama, too.\nWe've all kept in touch.
Even when I'd just moved in, we got along right\naway thanks to soccer.
I'm so glad we got a chance to be on the same\nteam again like this.
Have you made any new friends on the team here,\n<avatar_name>?
Alright, let's train with\neveryone else a little longer.
The more you kick the ball around together,\nthe better you'll get along!
You've still got it, Misaki. Seeing that\ntechnique again reminds me of elementary school.
What about you, Kojiro?\nIt's like you've really grown up while I was gone.\nIt's like you're a different person.
I guess.
Meanwhile, you're the same as ever.
I guess. Soccer's always fun, so I made tons of\nnew friends through it.
But I haven't forgotten that fighting spirit you\nshowed in the elementary school finals.\nYou kept going even when you were injured.
And to think I thought you were just a cheeky\nbrat with nothing but cheap tricks when you first\ntransferred in.
Ha ha, that really takes me back.\nI was so desperate back then.
Man, if you weren't in Nankatsu, Meiwa would've\nwon the championship for sure.
Hey, Hyuga, got a moment?
Sure, I'll be right there. Later, Misaki.
Hey there, <avatar_name>.\nWant to train together again?
I didn't think you were such a fighter.
How desperate are we talking?
Yeah, when the game gets intense,\nor we're in a pinch, even I get fired up.\nDid you really think I wouldn't?
Ah, right, like continuing to play on an injured\nleg, or hitting my head on the goalpost to block\na shot. Thinking back, I was pretty reckless.
But I just start moving on instinct,\nbefore I can think.
Since I was always changing schools, I've come to\ntreasure every moment I spend with my friends.\nI want to make every memory count.
I mean, it still hurts to say goodbye every time\nI move, but I have friends all over Japan, so I\ndon't feel lonely.
Besides, I still have all my memories of playing\nthe sport I love with them.
And I even managed to become friends with you.\nSo let's enjoy soccer as much as we can!
Misaki!
Tsubasa!
Phew...\nThe way those two pass is as crazy as ever.
I'm just glad they're on our side.
That's for sure.\nEvery time I see it, I'm amazed all over again.
You just get sucked in.
Yeah, they got us good with that when it was\nShutetsu versus Nankatsu.
Heck, Nankatsu SC only won the tournament thanks\nto their duo.
I can't even count the number of times they've\npulled us out of a mess.
Yeah... Brings back memories.
Before this tournament, I never imagined I'd get\nto play soccer with you again like this, Misaki.
Me neither. But I'm glad either way.
Not only did I get to see you and all my other\nold friends, but I even was lucky enough to meet\nnew people like <avatar_name>.
I'm honored you feel that way.
So I'm part of the group, too?
It's not that big a deal. We're all friends here.
Aren't you? We're all friends here.
That's right, <avatar_name>.\nWe're all friends. We've fought side by side.
Yup. They even welcomed me in with open arms,\ndespite the fact that I've been overseas for so\nlong.
Ha! I hadn't thought about it like that!\nBut still, I was so surprised to hear you were in\nFrance.
I missed Japan, too, but a friend is a friend, no\nmatter where they are.\nEspecially, if you've played soccer together.
Plus, I made even more friends through soccer in\nFrance. A new home always comes with new\nencounters.
Same as always... Even though you move so much,\nyou've always had more friends than anyone.
I'm just lucky to meet so many great people who\nlove soccer as much as me.
Okay you two, how about we practice for a bit?
After all this talking, I'm getting a little\nrestless. I've gotta move my body!
Yeah, me, too! Let's get started already!
Okay, <avatar_name>, I think that's enough\ntraining for today.
I can hardly believe you've improved so much in\nsuch a short time.\nI can tell you really love the sport.
Looks like you're picking up a lot of skills from\neveryone around you.
Where did you learn your techniques?
Did you improve all on your own then?
Oh, the same as you, I guess. I just picked them\nup naturally from playing soccer with my friends.
Ha ha, no way. I just happened to meet a lot of\ngreat people from moving around a lot.
But... I could only do that thanks to my dad.
Actually, my dad's a painter. We had to move\naround a lot because he's always studying art.
Even so, thanks to soccer, I've always managed to\nmake friends anywhere I ended up.
Come to think of it, maybe that's why we moved to\nplaces like Furano and Meiwa and Nankatsu. He was\nchoosing places that love soccer, for my sake.
And in France I learned a whole new kind of\nsoccer. Pierre's been an amazing rival.
I'm really grateful to my dad, for everything.
Now, I really want to win this tournament. For my\ndad, who's always thinking of me, and for all the\nfriends I've met everywhere I've lived!
Let's both give it our all in our remaining\nmatches!
We'll have to go our separate ways after the\ntournament, but we'll always be friends! So let's\nmake the most of the time we have!
Now's my chance! Go!
Yes!
You scored on ME? You really polished your\nshooting in France, Misaki.
I have to say, scoring on you is a huge\nconfidence boost.
Don't expect it to happen twice, though!
We'll see about that!
What's the matter, <avatar_name>?
Huh? You want to learn the shot I just used?
I like how it doesn't rely on strength.
It looked like I could copy it.
Well, I can't exactly shoot like Kojiro does.
I guess it might seem that way, since it doesn't\nuse extreme spin like Tsubasa's Drive Shot.
But that doesn't mean it's easy.
The most important part is being able to imagine\nthe path to the goal.
You have to picture the trajectory that will\ncarry the ball to the net, and keep that in your\nhead as you shoot.
Even a gentle arc like I used can be hard to\ntime, but with fine enough control even\nWakashimazu can't stop it.
First, I picture my ideal arc, then I try to\nrecreate it as best I can, focusing on giving it\njust the right spin.
Now, you try it. Imagine that perfect arc. You'll\nneed technique, too, but creativity is just as\nimportant.
Once you've got the mental image, you put it into\naction!
Tak! That one looked great! You've got a feel\n<avatar_name>for it now, right?
But you still need to keep practicing until you\ncan make the technique work in a real match.
I'll help you out, so let's do this together!
Something came to me when I saw you play\nrecently, <avatar_name>.
My specialty is the Jumping Volley, right?\nI think you'd have more options during the game if\nyou learned it, too.
For example, when you're receiving a cross from a\nteammate, or when the opponent deflects a ball\nand you need one last push.
Actually, I've been training to use it in a lot\nof situations, too.
It's really tough to get the timing right when\nkicking a ball midair.
But if you focus too much on the timing, you can\nend up with a weaker jump or a shallow kick.
Anyway, I guess what you really need to keep in\nmind is hitting the ball straight on with\neverything you've got... without hesitating.
Now, how about you give it a shot?
I hope I didn't intimidate you with all that.\nWith your skills, I'm sure you'll pick it up in\nno time!
I feel like there's something special about how\nyou've been playing lately, <avatar_name>.
Whenever I get a pass from you, it always comes\nright where I need it, and you're always running\ntowards where I want to pass, too.
Our playstyles really sync up.
This is the first time I've felt like this since\nplaying with Tsubasa.
If we practice working together,\nmaybe we can combo like I used to with him.
Do you mind trying working with me?\nI love testing out new possibilities.
Sounds great, let's do it!
I'm replacing Tsubasa?
Awesome! Glad to see you're excited, too.
No, Tsubasa's Tsubasa and you're you.
He and I will always have something special;\nI just thought we could be good partners, too.
No need to overthink it...\nJust play like you always do.
Anyway, let's get started!
That was great, <avatar_name>! Keep it up!
Pick up the pace! Go go go!
That was incredible, <avatar_name>! If we can do\nthat in a game, we'll be killer!
But that's the question: can we pull it off in a\nreal match.
I believe in you.\nI trust you as a talented partner.
Here we go!
Oh no you don't!
Gah! Not bad, Wakashimazu.\nBut the ball's still in play!
I'll finish this!
Now's my chance!
This one's mine!
This one's mine!
Huh?!
What the...?!
J-Just now, that was...!
That was Misaki and Tsubasa's shot from the\nelementary school finals!
Was it a fluke?!
No, they were perfectly in sync!
Yeah, that's how it felt to me.
Do you mind testing it out more after practice,\n<avatar_name>?
If I can make that shot with either you or\nTsubasa that could become Japan's secret weapon!
That dribble you used in the match with France\nwas amazing, Misaki!
It was different from you in elementary school or\neven my South American style. It was something\nbrand new!
Thanks, Tsubasa.
I've been trying to put together all the\ntechniques I've worked on over the years.
So with everything I learned from everyone in\nJapan, plus the improvements I made in France, I\nguess I've ended up with my own unique style.
Something everyone else helped me craft, but only\nI can do.
Can I try it, too?
I really admire your style, Misaki.
Huh? You mean my dribble? I suppose, but there's\na trick I'll have to teach you first.
Hah, I'm flattered... and a little embarrassed.
How about I return the favor for all the times\n<avatar_name>we've hung out and talked?
You want to learn that dribble I just did?
You can't go wrong with Misaki coaching you.\nPlus, I'm a little curious about it myself.
Then join us!
Okay, <avatar_name>, the important thing is ball\ncontrol, so...
Łoł!
You did it! That was amazing! I can't believe you\n<avatar_name>got past Tsubasa.
Yeah, that sure was a surprise.\nYou perfectly copied Misaki!
If this works on even Pierre and Tsubasa, then we\ncan definitely lead Japan to victory in the\nfinals!
Kisugi!
On it!
Uh oh!
Woohoo! I scored on Wakabayashi!
Great shot, Kisugi!
Tch, as good as ever. I feel like whoever\nreceives your assist is twice as dangerous.
C'mon, don't be ridiculous.
No, I'm serious. You really think Kisugi could've\nscored on his own?
Yeah, no way...
Heh...
You need something, <avatar_name>?
You want to know the trick behind my assists?
Let's see... Well, I've moved around a lot, and\nplayed with a lot of different people, so I've\nseen all sorts of playstyles.
Observing people play also helps me fit in faster\nwhenever I'm on a new team.
And thanks to all that experience, I can easily\ntell what people want from me.
I'm really not sure how I could teach that to you\nthough.
Hmm... Let me put it this way... Soccer is a team\nsport, so I think everyone should play how they\nmost enjoy it.
But you need to think about what your teammates\nneed... What kind of play they'd love to make.
I mean, even if we're just goofing around,\nwouldn't they have more fun if they were more\ninvolved? I think inclusion is important.
And it's the same in a match.\nHelping your teammates to play their best also\nhelps the team win.
I guess the trick is to pay close attention to\nyour teammates.
By observing them, and thinking about how to give\nthem a chance to shine, the plays will come\nnaturally.
Don't worry! I can tell you've got a good sense\nfor this sort of thing. I guarantee it.

I want to win this as much as anyone!
Alright! Follow my lead, guys!
I won't let you down!
C'mon guys, just one more!
Let's protect our lead!
Keep at it and we'll catch up, guys!
It's just a tie! The game starts here!

Let's finish this together!
Eat this!
Stampede!
Here's the one!
Eagle Shot!
My Eagle Shot flies!
This'll do it!
The result of my hard work, Wild Eagle!
The Wild Eagle!
Take this! Full force Wild Eagle!
Wild Eagle!
Wild Eagle Shot, get in there!
Wild Eagle Shot!
This'll do it!
You can do it!
My ball!
I can do this!
Try and take it!
This one's for keeps!
End of the line!
Oh no you don't!
See that, Tsubasa? Hard work works!
Darn it! That's Tsubasa for you.
I'm not losing to you, Hyuga!
Ugh, guess that's Hyuga for you.
I've not been slackin', either!
No rust on you, Misaki!
Hard work can overtake talent!
It's not easy taking on talent...
Your plays are so creative, Masao!
Masao, even on your own you're a force!
Your plays are so creative, Kazuo!
Kazuo, even on your own you're a force!
You're slackin', Nitta!
Uh oh, Nitta's quicker than I thought!
See that, Jito? I've got guts, too!
Man, Jito's one tough dude.
You won't break me with that, Soda!
You're pretty tenacious, Soda!
You're not the only one with guts!
Jeez, you've really got guts, Ishizaki.
That's not gonna work, Urabe!
Darn it! I won't lose next time, Urabe!
I know what you're doing, Oda!
Ugh! So you do got some moves, Oda!
You wanted a match, Ishida? Well, I won!
So you're not all talk, Ishida!
I won't lose a mental battle, Schneider!
So this is the Emperor's true strength?!
You let yourself get cocky, Heine!
I'll never live this down, will I?
Even knee deep in mud, I'll win, Pierre!
Is he too much for me?
Not even you can stop me, Jean!
They do call him the Shield of France...
You lost because you looked down on me!
You're pretty confident, Kluivoort.
I'll take you on anytime, Rusciano!
Don't mess around with me, Rusciano!
I want to win as much as you, Carlos!
What technique!
I'm a prodigy of hard work, Diaz!
So he really is a prodigy...
You let yourself get cocky, Victorino!
Look at that lightning fast technique!
Are you even trying to win, Senghor?
Holy cow, Senghor! That technique!
You've gotten too comfortable, Ryan!
All I can do is work even harder!
Soccer is more than power, Blake!
You'll never keep me down, Blake!
I'll give it my all until the very end.
Training is more useful than talent!
I want to win as bad as anyone!
It's all been leading up to this, guys.
No one can take the ball from me!
These are the events from behind the scenes of the\nfiercely fought Junior Youth World Challenge...\nmore or less.
The Night After the 3rd Scrimmage Match
Oh man!
Phew...
(I can't believe even Hyuga's out of breath.\nThat super heavy medicine ball looks like it\nreally works his legs.)
(Not to mention he must be exhausted after the\nscrimmage, but he just keeps on training.\nHyuga's got a lotta guts.)
(But I can't let myself fall behind!\nI need to improve my Eagle Shot, too!)
The next day...
Hmm...
(All that harsh training must be finally catching\nup to him. Hyuga's in rough shape.)
(It's only a few days until the tournament starts,\nnot to mention we start off against Italy's\ndefensive wall... and our ace striker is wiped.)
(That said, he wouldn't ease up even if I told him\nto. How do I handle this?)
All right! Let's start the practice match!\nThe real thing's right around the corner,\nso pull it together and give it your all!
(Today, I'm on Hyuga's team.\nLet's see if I can get through to him...)
Coach, can we talk?
What's up, Matsuyama?
It's about Hyuga's condition lately.\nHow does he seem to you?
To be honest, I don't see any of his usual power\nor sharpness. He must have a lot of fatigue built\nup.
And in a few days, we'll have our first match\nagainst Italy with Europe's finest goalie\nZino Hernandez.
If Hyuga expects to score on him, he needs to get\nback in top condition.
Which is why I told him to treat today's practice\nmatch as an adjustment period, but...
Could you put me farther up for this practice\nmatch?
Up front?
Yeah. I realize it might seem like a bit much to\nask, since I was just made a defense the other\nday...
But while I may not be as good as Hyuga,\nI'm pretty confident in my long shots.
I just thought that if I were up front,\nI could take off some of the pressure off him,\nand he wouldn't need to do any reckless plays.
Hmm...
(I suppose Matsuyama has been working on his\nshots.)
(It's not a bad idea to give him some more\nshooting experience up the field like a forward.)
(Not to mention if an accident were to happen\nduring the tournament, it's always better to have\nmore players capable in each position.)
Sure, go for it. I'll have you play near Hyuga.\nSound good?
Sounds great, Coach!
(In order to make things easier for Hyuga,\nI'll try to draw away opponents.\nI'll also need to shoot and score, too.)
(And to do that, I'll learn from the best striker\nI know... Kojiro Hyuga!)
Looking good out there, Matsuyama.\nYou put the forwards to shame. Keep it up!
Thanks, Coach!
(I tried following Hyuga's example to score while\nleading the team, and it went surprisingly well.)
(I was focusing a bit too much on my shots,\nand with all my energy focused on that,\nI neglected other opportunities on the field.)
(But how else am I supposed to score as he does?\nAm I just not as talented as him?)
(During the Junior Hero League and training camp,\nI felt like I'd figured out my strengths,\nbut I guess I have more to learn.)
(Yeah... That's the mindset I need during\npractice, too.)
(Heck, it might even help me master that shot I've\nbeen struggling with. Can't hurt to try.)
You got me good today, Matsuyama.\nYou're way better than you were back in the\nJunior Hero League.
It was almost like I was facing Hyuga out there.
Thanks. That means a lot coming from someone\nI've had so many battles on the field with.
(So I reminded him of Hyuga, huh?)
(Kojiro Hyuga. I only played against you once\nduring the Junior Hero League, but I'd like to go\nup against you again sometime.)
(And if I want our next face-to-face to be worth\nsomething, I need to make sure I can give you a\nfight!)
(But... Is Hyuga really okay? Even in today's\nmatch he was clearly in bad shape. It's fine if\nhe can recover by the tournament, but...)
(Well, not that I can do much about it by\nworrying. In the end, I just have to put my\nfaith in him to pull it together.)
(I don't have the luxury to waste time worrying\nanyway. I need to polish my own skills too,\nto help out the team however I can!)
Okay, let's head into the next practice!
(Just a little more...)
(I have to power up my Tiger Shot before our match\nwith Italy!)
Junior Youth World Challenge Preliminaries,\nBlock A, Japan vs. Italy
(I don't care if you're the best goalie in\nEurope, this shot is gonna bury you!)
Eat this! Neo Tiger Shot!
I did it... I really did it!
(Hyuga!)
Japanese Practice Area the following day...
(His Neo Tiger Shot was incredible!)
(My Eagle Shot was practically useless though;\nI couldn't score even one goal on Hernandez.)
(Plus Hyuga managed to power up his Tiger Shot\nwith that harsh training AND recover in time for\nthe match.)
(I only recently decided I had to get on your\nlevel, but you've made the gap between us even\ngreater.)
(We may play different positions, but as a soccer\nplayer and as a rival, it feels so frustrating.)
(But... I suppose I should've expected as much\nwith how talented you are and the work you put\nin.)
(Right. If the gap has widened,\nthen I just need to close it again.)
(I really, REALLY don't like losing to you,\nafter all!)
Something on your mind, Matsuyama?
Ah, no, it's nothing.
Hmm...
Well, if you're ever stuck on something,\ntry taking a look at the people around you.
With all the reps we've got gathered for this,\nyou might just find a hint among your teammates.
R-Right. Thank you.
(Watch my teammates?)
(Come to think it, we have another player among\nthe reps who improved a huge amount by observing\nHyuga.)
(He even learned a shot comparable to the\nTiger Shot.)
(Right... of course. No matter how you play,\nthere's nothing wrong with learning from others.\nWhy would there be?)
(And since I've got the chance, I should put\naside my stupid pride and watch Hyuga closely,\njust like that guy.)
(If all goes well and I notice something,\nmaybe it'll help me master my shot or improve as\na player.)
Okay guys, this may just be a practice match,\nbut that doesn't mean you can slack off!\nYou've each got your own things to work on, right?
Right, Coach!
Matsuyama, I'm having you back up the forwards\nagain today.
Thank you, Coach.
(Today we're up against Hyuga, Wakashimazu,\nTakeshi, and Sorimachi... The whole Toho lineup.)
(Back in the Junior Hero League, I thought of them\nas nothing more than another team I had to play\nagainst.)
(But if I watch them with an eye on learning from\ntheir playstyle or mindset, I'm sure I might\ndiscover something.)
(Besides, I've been aiming to improve my\nEagle Shot, but how far have I come exactly?)
(Wakashimazu's the perfect player to try it out\non!)
Okay! I won't lose! Time to show the fruits of my\nefforts!
Ugh... Not bad, Matsuyama.
Yeah, I felt the drive to win from you almost like\nthis was a real match.
I asked to play on the frontline, which I guess\nmight seem a bit selfish... So of course I\nhave to prove I deserve to be in the position.
By the way, Wakashimazu, can I ask you something?
Sure, what is it?
How does my Eagle Shot compare to back in the\nJunior Hero League?
Let's see... Compared to back then,\nit's faster and hits my arm with more force.\nI'd say it's pretty powered up.
So... if you compare my shot to Hyuga's\nNeo Tiger Shot, what do you think?
...It's a little weird to say this after you\nscored on me, but you're not even close.\nThe Neo Tiger Shot is in a class of its own.
Thanks. I had a feeling.
Huh?
There's no way I'd catch up right away to a shot\nthat Hyuga has put so much effort into.
But depending on how much effort I put in myself,\nmaybe I could get there someday. That's what I\ntry to keep in mind when I'm training, anyway.
So I'm glad to hear it's improved.\nThat means I'm on the right path, at least.
Heh. Hyuga said the same thing after seeing\nSchneider's shot.
Acknowledging that your opponent is better than\nyou and making an effort to reach their level\nmight just be the best way to improve.
(I realized it all over again after facing Hyuga\ntoday.)
(Hyuga's got more than just a powerful shot.\nWhat's most scary about him is his intense\nfighting spirit and the fierce aura he gives off.)
(Especially when he's pushed into a corner.\nHe never fails to deliver results.)
(If so, that's all the more reason for guys like\nme to give it our all when we're on our back\nfoot.)
(Right now he's my teammate, but someday we'll be\nplaying against each other again, as rivals.)
(I don't want to play second fiddle to Hyuga.\nNot in terms of my play and much less in terms of\nmy hard work and determination.)
(Which is exactly why I need to watch him closely\nand learn from him while we're still on the same\nteam!)
Junior Youth World Challenge Preliminaries,\nBlock A, Japan vs. Senegal
(That settles it! All the training I've done so\nfar has been in preparation for this!)
I'll... I'll intercept it!
I... I did it!
Japanese Practice Area the following day...
(Yesterday, I perfected my new Eagle Shot in the\nmatch with Senegal.)
(I've had Hyuga on my mind the whole time,\nbut I guess it paid off.)
(Nothing feels better than your efforts being\nrewarded.)
(Well, given my current position I don't need to\nworry too much about shooting...)
(But now I have my new Eagle Shot, as well as the\nfighting spirit I learned from Hyuga.)
(I wonder how much I could accomplish now if I\nwere able to commit to playing offense.)
(And what if I went head-to-head with Hyuga?)
(Nah. As much as I'd love to test myself as an\nindividual player, the team's got important\nmatches coming up.)
(I'm sure plenty of us want to try things out in\nthese practice matches. I should stop being so\nselfish.)
Hmm...
...And that's it for Team A!
Got it!
As for Team B...
Matsuyama, can you play today as if you were on\nthe front line? 
What?
But I didn't ask for that today.
Your shooting in yesterday's match was truly\nbrilliant.
And lately you've been doing just as good as the\nusual forwards.
Ideally, being able to use you seriously in an\noffensive position would be a good option for the\nteam, so we're experimenting with that.
Coach...
Besides, haven't you been wanting to test your\nskills? Don't hold back.
Y-Yes, sir!
(Now that I've got this chance, I'll do my best!\nToday's the day!)
Hyuga!
What?
Care for a little contest?
...You're challenging me?
Sure am. How about we see who scores more goals\ntoday? Simple, right?
Hmph, bring it on.\nYou're going to get embarrassed, though.
Oh, we'll see about that. I'm coming for you!
(Today's opposing goalie is Wakabayashi. If I want\nto score more goals than Hyuga against him,\nI need to stay focused.)
(I'll concentrate on making powerful shots.\nThat's the only way.)
(As a soccer player, as an offensive player,\nas a team, it's the only way to show up Hyuga.)
(And I owe Coach, too. He's put a lot of faith in\nme, so I need to show him that wasn't a mistake.)
(I'll use all I've been working on in this match!)
Yes! I won! Hyuga!
Ugh...
...Much as I hate to admit it, you beat me.
Guess you've been putting in the hours, Matsuyama.
Yeah. The way you are today, your shots are\ncomparable even to Hyuga's.
Seems like Japan's got a new secret weapon.
I'm happy to hear you two say that, but\npersonally, I still feel like I'm struggling.
Why?
I mean, sure, I scored more, but I had to wring\nout every last drop of my strength to take you on.\nI neglected everything else.
The way you've focused on offense reminds me how\namazing of a player you really are.
You're crazy good.
Yeah right. I should be the one sayin' that.
Sheesh. I completely lost to that stubbornness of\nyours.
But ultimately this was just a practice match.
Next time, in high school,\nI'll take you on for real!
Yeah, and I hope you're ready!
(Matsuyama was magnificent today.)
(I remember he started out as a midfielder\nsetting up plays on offense and defense, and then\nhe converted to playing straight defense.)
(To think he'd show such prowess playing on\noffense!)
(He can fight Tsubasa in the midfield, he displays\ngreat leadership on defense, and on top of that\nhis shooting ability is approaching Hyuga's...)
(He's the sort of player a coach can't help but\ndwell on... in the good sense.)
Hey Misaki, Misugi, if you guys have time, wanna\nplay this soccer game with me?
A video game?
It's for four players, so I thought we could play\nit with <avatar_name> too.
A game, eh? I've never really played one before,\nso I'm not sure I'd be any good at it.
I've played some with friends in France, so I know\nwhat they are, but I'm that great at them.
It's just for a change of pace. Come on, I think\nit'll be fun.
In that case... Sure, but give me a chance, okay?
What's this? You're all playing a game together?
Yeah. Matsuyama invited us, and it's surprisingly\nfun. I'm getting some good ideas for the real\nthing.
I'm still not any good at it, but Matsuyama's\ngoing easy on us so it's been fun.
Huh. I guess even third years aren't going to be\nany good at stuff they've never played.
Wait, hold on, I'm not going easy on you!
Actually, is this seriously your first time\nplaying?! I'm shocked that we're falling behind!
Soccer is still soccer in video games:\nit all comes down to instinct!
Darn it! Hey, <avatar_name>!\nYou've gotta try harder!
Anyway, have fun. We're going for a run.
Okay, stay safe on the roads!
Now's our chance, Misaki! Let's finish it here!
You got it! Ready on my end!
Uh oh...
I mean, <avatar_name>! Don't give up so easily just\nbecause it's a video game!
It's time for us to make our comeback!\nWe can't lose!
See? What'd I tell you, <avatar_name>?
As long as you never give up, no matter how bad it\nlooks, you can always make a comeback!\nThere's always a chance to win!
Sheesh, we lost from that position? I'll admit it\nMatsuyama, you're more stubborn than us.
Seriously. You play exactly the same, whether in a\nvideo game or on the field.
But actually, you gave up WAY too soon, <avatar_name>.
Even if Matsuyama pulled you through in the end,\nthat was just unacceptable.
Yeah, I agree. I'd never forgive if you showed\nthat attitude in a real match.
Lectured because of a game...
But video games aren't real...
Darn straight! It may be digital, but it's still\nsoccer.
We're representing Japan here! We should be aiming\nfor victory at all times, no matter what!
You hearing yourself? Teamwork is teamwork,\nwhether it's a video game or a real life match.
You've got to push yourself to turn things around,\nno matter how bad it looks!
He's right.\nIt's important to have the right attitude.
Always giving your all and never giving up. That\napplies to both real and virtual soccer matches.\nDon't forget something so obvious.
Right? You should be trying to learn from\neverything you can.
Looks like you never expected this video game\nstuff to lead into a real discussion about soccer,\ndid you <avatar_name>?
Anyway, now that you understand, let's have a\nrematch!
Learn from your mistakes and do even better this\ntime!
Yo, <avatar_name>. You're looking pretty good, eh?
You were selected outta nowhere for league play,\nand I didn't know what to expect, but you're\nshowing why you deserve to be here.
If you keep improving at this rate, we should be\nable to expect big things out of Furano soccer\nnext year.
My generation's team prided itself\non teamwork and tenacity,
but what kind of soccer will define\nyour generation remains to be seen.
Still, you've been watching us for a while,\nso I imagine you appreciate the value we place\non teamwork.
The biggest cause for concern next year is\nhow to bridge the gap in firepower with Nankatsu\nand Toho. I don't know how to fix that.
I'll work as hard as the captain!
I'll provide the extra firepower!
Right. It all starts with effort.
I've worked hard on offense and defense with\nthe whole team, as well. We can really up our\nlong shots and other soccer skills together.
Yeah, that sounds good to me.
I'm nowhere near as talented as Tsubasa and the\nrest, and yet, I was able to work hard and nail\nmy shots. If you try hard, the sky's the limit.
Seeing how hard you've tried so far, I have\nlittle doubt you're up for the task. Go for it!
Alright, let's call it a day.\nRest up and get ready for tomorrow!
Okay!
Good job, everyone!
Wow, we worked hard again today!
I'm so hungry I could collapse!
Nah, you still look like\nyou have energy to spare...
Wait a second!
There's something I want to show you!
Wh-What's going on?
Wh-Where's this coming from?!
Can't it wait 'til tomorrow?
Well, we have time, don't we, Kaneda?
This is <avatar_name> we're talkin' about.\nIt's worth the time, ain't it?
Putting the ball there of all places,\n<avatar_name>... What in the world are you thinking?
...Seriously?!
Wh-What the heck?!
Wasn't that the captain's longshot?!
That longshot requires tenacious legs that\nwon't buckle even when the ground turns to swamp.
How hard did you practice to nail that\nin such a short period of time?! Jeez...
That's really incredible, <avatar_name>!
Tak! If we could pair your stellar shot\nup with the captain's...!
We'd have a great chance at winning\nthe Junior Hero League!
And not only that...
Did you see that, first and second-years?!\nThis is proof that hard work pays off!
All of the players who didn't make the bench for\nthe league games would be well-advised to follow\n<avatar_name>'s example and try your very best!
After we leave, the fate of\nFurano soccer will fall to you!
We want you to create a new Furano MS soccer team\ncapable of doing next year what we failed to do\nthis year... Winning the Nationals!
Tak!
You're really something, <avatar_name>.\nEven more so than I thought.
We're expecting big things out of you. It'll be\nup to you to carry the Furano MS soccer team next\nyear.
But the Junior Hero League comes first!\nEverybody here will be thrilled\nif we fight through league play undefeated!
Oh, it's you...
You're, <avatar_name>, right?\nYou really killed it last match.
<avatar_name>, right? I remember you\nfrom the last match. You played well.
You're...<avatar_name>, yeah?\nI remember seeing you play once or twice.
So, whaddaya want?
Teach me how to practice a long shot!
Tell me how to be a grittier player!
I'm pretty sure everyone has their own way of\npracticing the long shot... But I'll tell you\nhow I do it if that's what'cha want.
You're asking me that? All I can really\ntell you is to go full tilt in practice...
Hmm. I guess the best first step is to practice\nwhile keeping in mind what you hope to achieve.
Like wanting more power in your shots, for\nexample... I'll teach what I know if you think\nit'll help.
My special longshot requires sturdy legs\nthat hold their footing no matter the terrain.
Developing tree trunk legs isn't something that\nhappens overnight. If you practice every day,\nyou'll get them eventually.
That's why there isn't just one way to train.\nYou just need to be thorough in strengthening your\nlower body and hitting your shots.
Train your lower body, practice your shot,\nand keep dialing up the power.
Do that, and you'll find that your play\nwill naturally get fiercer over time.
That's about all I can tell you.\nThe rest is up to you!
Oh hey, you're <avatar_name>, right? What's up?
I'm here to show you how much\nmy practice has paid off!
See how much grittier my play's become!
I can hardly wait. Let's see what ya got!
Grittier? Okay then, show me what you've got.
Putting the ball there of all places,\n<avatar_name>... What in the world are you thinking?
That was my longshot!\nYou mastered it this quickly?!
I see. So you worked hard at training your lower\nbody and practicing your shot like I suggested.
I have no intention of losing to anyone unwilling\nto put in their due diligence, but that's\ndefinitely not you. You're really something!
With how good you are right now, I wouldn't be\nsurprised in the least if you were chosen to\nrepresent Japan.
I'm shooting for that, too,\nso let's do our best to make it happen!
I was sure the match against Musashi MS would be\nall about me and Misugi, but I'm looking forward\nto facing off against you, as well.
Let's make it a match to remember!
I was sure the match against Toho Academy would be\nall about me and Hyuga, but I'm looking forward to\nfacing off against you, as well.
Let's make it a match to remember!
Are you staying behind to practice more,\n<avatar_name>?
I getcha. If ya don't practice,\nyou don't feel like you're getting anywhere.
I thought I had practiced harder than anyone in\nJapan and caught up to Tsubasa and Hyuga... only\nto encounter even stronger players overseas.
The scrimmages completely changed my\nperspective on what kinda skill was out there.
Practicing and studying technique are the only way\nwe're going to compete against the world on equal\nfooting... You feel the same, don't you?
That's right! Two people working together\nis definitely better than one.\nLet's practice together.
Sticking around with you to practice\nis just like it was back at Furano.
Us finally ending up as teammates like this...\nLet's use this opportunity to absorb\nas much as we can from each other!
Well, would you mind helping me\nwork on something a bit first?
There's something I want to practice\nas a defender. Give me a hand, okay?
Alright, I'm going to do a fast,\nlong pass along the ground.
I'll try to aim for where you're running,\nso take a shot when it gets to you!
Okay, there we go!
Alright! That was good!
I'll take a long shot!
Watch this, Matsuyama!
Nice shot, <avatar_name>!
Nice shot, <avatar_name>!
Phenomenal Eagle Shot!\nIt looked just like one of mine!
That was an Eagle Shot, wasn't it?!
I see. So you've been practicing since then.
I thought this was my practice,\nbut you're the one who's killing it.
That was an Eagle Shot, wasn't it?!\nWhen did you...?
I see. So you followed my example\nand kept applying yourself...
I'm kind of embarrassed that you took after me,\nbut I'm at least glad it helped, <avatar_name>!
To be honest, I was a little nervous about\nyour abilities when you were chosen as a rep.
But we've got nothing to worry about\nif you can do all this!
I may be ahead of you back at school.\nBut that doesn't matter here... Here, we are both\nrepresenting Japan as best we can!
Back in Japan, we may be rivals.\nBut that doesn't matter here... Here, we are\nboth representing Japan as best we can!
Yo, <avatar_name>.
Are you two heading out soon?
I don't see you two often.
We have off from afternoon practice today,\ndon't we?
You can practice like you do normally, but I\nthought this would be a good opportunity to\nwork on something special.
It's true that we're from different schools and\nregions, but right now, we're allies, competing\ntogether.
I thought it'd be good to go\nwatch other teams practice.
Urabe and I were converted into defenders after\nbecoming reps, so we thought it'd be a good idea\nto see how our opponents move and play.
Soda, Jito, Takasugi, and Ishizaki were all\noriginally defenders. They have way more\nexperience at the position than we do.
You guys should come, too.\nThe more eyes we have, the more we'll notice.\nPlus, it'll be way more fun!
Alright, let's do it!
Hey, <avatar_name>! Come when you're ready!
There, Kluivoort!
Nice pass!
Ha! The defense is full of holes!
Ugh, darn it, Dirk!\nYou really put your weight behind that tackle!
Kluivoort! Don't you dare slack off!
Napoleon! Bossis! Let's get in there!
Gah! Whatcha gonna do?!
Don't get flustered! Ferreri and\nDegaulle will mark Napoleon and Bossis!\nI'll keep an eye on Pierre! Stay focused!
Ngh! C'mon, Jean! Gimme an opening!
Both of you recovered!
Listen up, everyone! You need to hold your ground!\nYou can't afford to give your opponent\nan inch in a real match!
A sound defense allows for a sound offense.\nKeep that in mind at all times!
If our defense were sturdier, we wouldn't have\nsuffered that embarrassing defeat earlier.\nWe need to reflect and train harder.
A solid performance by the defenders means less\npressure on the offense. It's on us to\nrestore England to its former glory!
Let's do this, Alberto!
You're not going anywhere!
Huh?!
Alright! Overlap!
Now's our chance!
Darn it!\nI had no idea he'd time the shot like that...
Being a defender isn't just about defense.\nIf you see an opening, exploit it!
The world's defenders are really impressive,\ndon'tcha think? One-on-one, they excel at all\nsorts off things... Coordination, leadership...
We're gonna have to study harder...
Sorry, but... I'm gonna head out.\nNitta asked me to meet him for practice.
Sounds good! Good luck out there!
Since coming to America, I've been moved onto\ndefense and have been doing my best to warm to\nthe role...
But sometimes, I can't help but wonder\nif this is really the best fit for me.
Like when I give instructions... Is anyone really\ngoing to listen to someone who doesn't have those\nyears of experience on defense?
Believe in yourself!
You'll get there with effort!
Yeah, you're right. If I let my concerns\nnegatively impact my play, it'll only make\nthings worse.
Alright! I'll use everything I learned today\nto make myself more confident on the field!
Right. That's all I can really do.
I'll work hard to use everything\nI learned today to carry our team to victory!
Okay, let's head to the practice grounds\nand get some work done!
I need to focus on practicing and put these\nworries behind me. I have a lot left to do!
Take care of that side, Ishizaki! I'll go for\nthe ball. Mark Soda and Tsubasa! Watch out for the\nlong shot, Jito!
Woohoo!
Alright, got it!
Ngh! I can't find any openings! I'll drop back...
Not on my watch, Misaki!
Darn it!
(Should I go up field from here\nand join the offense?)
(Whoa! The opponent's defense has collapsed\nnow that the ball's been taken!)
(And that means...)
Run, Nitta!
Nice job, Matsuyama! I got it!
Gah...
Don't fret, Nitta! You ran well!\nYou'll get 'em next time!
R-Right!
Ack, Matsuyama's directions are really on point.\nHard to believe he only recently became a\ndefender.
I wasn't sure how he'd handle the sudden\nconversion, but it certainly looks like he's\nthe right man for the job.
Man! He's gotta unique eye. Definitely different\nthan Soda and me. Musta picked that thinkin' up\nas a midfielder.
(Matsuyama certainly is special. If he can time\nhis passes to Nitta like that, it'll be the\nperfect counter.)
(Then again... that he can pass like\nthat means I gotta step up to keep up!)
You were right, Misugi. Matsuyama's move\nto defender is working out swimmingly.
Even better than I expected. I always knew he was\na talented player, but I never thought he'd be\nable to make this big of a jump so quickly.
And he continues to improve himself every day.\nI'm sure he still has a lot of growth left in him.
Good job, <avatar_name>!
Today, I managed to play and direct the\nteam with more confidence than ever before.
It's all because of what you said to me before.\nYour words really got me thinking, and helped\nme do what I needed to.
I'm glad we met!
Let's try even harder!
Effort makes anything possible.
Of course! I'm nowhere near satisfied!
Yeah, I feel the same!
So what should we do? Little more practice?
Tak! I was planning on sticking\naround and practicing some more.
Let's do our best so that we can lift the\ntournament victor's cup together, <avatar_name>!
Hey, <avatar_name>. I'm gonna keep practicing.\nHafta make the best use of the time ya got!
Originally, the Eagle Shot was developed as a long\nshot. It's since evolved into a long pass that\ncan be sent from our end of the field.
But if you really think about it, shots and passes\nare both carefully controlled kicks toward goal.
You can kick the Eagle Shot, right?\nThen, I'm sure you can do what I do.
While you want shots to be hard for the goalkeeper\nto get, the opposite holds true for passes to\nteammates. You'll wanna keep that in mind.
You're not goin' any further, Captain!
Pathetic!
Huh?! Sorry, <avatar_name>! Stop 'im for me!
<avatar_name>!
Ack, <avatar_name>...
I'll get you, Matsuyama!
Pathetic!
Whaaa?! Sorry, <avatar_name>! Get 'im!
<avatar_name>!
Ack, <avatar_name>...
What's wrong, <avatar_name>?\nPractice is already over, isn't it?
Next time, I'll show you what I can do.
Gah... Could you teach me that dribble?
Want to work dribbling with me?
Alright, I'll practice with you then. I'll teach\nyou the trick to my dribble if you're up for it.
No need to feel frustrated. All that really\nmatters is that you remain competitive and\nwilling to keep pushing yourself.
I don't have the technical prowess of Tsubasa,\nMisaki, and Misugi. And I don't have the power\nto blow people away like Hyuga.
That's why I focus on pushing my body. Just like\nyou do your best to learn from others, I do my\nbest to get better the way I know how. Get me?
No, no, no... You have to be\nready for an instantaneous dash.
You're too careless with your ball control. At\nthat distance, the ball will be stolen for sure.
Łoł! That was great, <avatar_name>!
Looks like you're getting the hang of it.\nAll that's left is to try to use it in an actual\nmatch! Good luck!
Those two... Even in practice,\nthey really pull out all the stops!
Tsubasa competing with Matsuyama's ball handling\nskills... Really reminds me of the Nankatsu vs.\nFurano match.
Aw, man! This is tough!
Ngh! No openings anywhere!
(This is just like before!)
Ah! Did Tsubasa lose his balance?!
(Losing my balance on purpose is the\nonly way I'll get Matsuyama to shift!)
I'm not falling for that again!
Darn it!
I won this round, Tsubasa.
Nice one, Matsuyama.
I'm in much better shape than I was at Nationals,\nso I was sure I could get the ball away from you.
I've been working especially hard on my ball\nhandling this last month to make sure that won't\nhappen.
Well done, Matsuyama! I knew we could count on\nyou! Alright, then! I'll get you back next time!
What's wrong, <avatar_name>?
You want me to teach you better ball handling?
Your ball handling is outstanding.
Your handling is the best, Matsuyama.
R-Really? Well, if you were that impressed,\nI guess I could teach you.
Well, when it comes to ball handling,\nI've got confidence and then some.
Alright. I'll give you a few pointers.
Listen. It all starts with the basics.\nKeep your eyes on the feet and lines of sight\nof the opponents in front of you.
Then put your body and feet between the ball\nand the opponent to protect the ball from them.
The most dangerous part is the moment when the\nopponent steps in to take the ball from you.
At that time, you can step back hard with the\nball to re-establish distance between you and your\nopponent.
That's about all I can say in terms of\nfundamentals, but the most important part of ball\nhandling is to keep the ball safe at all costs.
With no real talent to work with, the only reason\nI can compete with Tsubasa on this is my absolute\nunwillingness to give the ball up.
Alright, then. I'll practice with you a bit.
There's no need for instruction. You just get the\nhang of it by protecting and stealing the ball\nfrom your opponent over and over again.
Okay! Here goes nothing!
You dodged my step! Impressive!
Don't forget to stick to the ball no matter what,\n<avatar_name>. While practice makes perfect,\nthat's the most important rule of all.
Alright, let's give it another try!\nI don't want to go out on a sour note!
Hyuga! I'm gonna crush you!
Outta my way! Now!
Gah! At this rate...
Come and get it, Matsuyama!\nI'll take you down again and again!
Darn it, Matsuyama. You're more stubborn\nthan I am. I guess I'll guard this zone...
There!
C'mon!
Alright! I got it! You see that, Hyuga?!
You gotta be kidding me!
Okay! Let's take a break!
Looks like I came out on top this time, Hyuga!
Hmph. Showing that much tenacity in practice...\nMan, you're really a stubborn one, aren't you?
That's my secret weapon!\nThe world's best won't even know what hit 'em!
That matchup of Matsuyama and Hyuga was\nreally impressive, wasn't it, <avatar_name>?\nThere was a lot of skill on display.
I was surprised by Matsuyama's tenacity.
Do you practice that hard?
I've definitely struggled against his never say\ndie attitude. I'm sure the world's best will have\ntheir hands full with him as well.
That's another thing he's got going for him. He\nalways gives it his all, no matter what. That's\nwhy he never gives up, no matter how bad it looks.
That's right, <avatar_name>. You may be studying\nMatsuyama's play, but you've still only matched\nhim on a superficial level.
Even though you've watched him at school for\na while, it's his attitude toward soccer that\nshouldn't go overlooked.
You've only been on the same team for a\nshort time, so you may not have noticed,\nbut his approach to soccer is really amazing.
If you're going to study him, you'll want to study\nnot only his play, but his persistent spirit as\nwell. That's what really makes him stand out.
Hmm...\nI think I've gotten a little better since then.
Matsuyama, what are you watching?
This? Nankatsu vs. Furano at Nationals.\nI'm trying to figure out how I lost.
You're really quite the student of the game.
The Eagle Shot, Feinting Tackle, and Avalanche\nAssault... All were effective, but Nankatsu was\nparticularly strong at the time.
That reminds me... I've been interested in it\nfor a while now, but what exactly is the Avalanche\nAssault anyway?
This full-on assault was especially good.\nIt really showed the overall strength of our team.
You're interested in the Avalanche Assault?
Well, it's a team-based attack...\nHow do I put it...?
Oh yeah, <avatar_name>. You just joined in July,\nso you haven't seen it practiced, have you?
The formation isn't exactly set in stone,\nbut it's a tactic we've practiced relentlessly.
We tear into the opponent's side of the field like\nan avalanche and cover each other as we continue\nthe attack.
The Avalanche Assault is basically a tactic in\nwhich every member of the team goes all out to do\nwhatever it takes to score a goal.
Specifically, we dribble forward, and everyone\nfights to maintain control of the ball while\npushing toward their goal.
It's not easy to explain. It's a tactic that\nrelies on everyone knowing their teammates and\nplaying as one.
<avatar_name>... Sano...\nYou'll be leading the team before long.
That's why I think it'd be good if we\npracticed one of the team's tactics together.
Because it's a strategy that worked\nwell against the champion, Nankatsu!
I see...
I was on Jito's team, so I find a tactic that\ndoesn't rely on a single player to be somewhat\nrefreshing.
Then you should mix Jito's style with a team-based\noffense and lead the team the way you feel most\ncomfortable, Sano.
Thanks! I appreciate the advice!
Well, you're eventually going to be\nleading Furano, so keep it in mind!
Well, you're eventually going to be\nleading the team, so keep it in mind!
But when you play Furano MS, you'll be facing\nthe absolute best Avalanche Assault out there,\nso be sure to prepare yourself for it!
Enough talk for now, let's practice.\nWatching a video of such an intense match has put\nme in the mood to move.
Huh? You taught them the Avalanche Assault, right?\nThen let's practice. Let's practice until the only\nlight is the stars!
Our new way of attacking worked out\nbetter than expected!
Tak! You really outdid yourselves this time,\nYamamuro!
That's because I was still playing soccer in\nmy head even while I was studying for exams!
Well, it's all thanks to being\nunable to focus on studying.
But that's fine! You have more than\nenough time if you start studying now!
You aren't taking the exams, are you, Kondo?
But it's disappointing that we're only going to\nbe able to play at this level a few times more.
But it's disappointing that we'll never be\nable to play at this level again after today.
What are you saying, Wakamatsu?
He's right! We've got <avatar_name> here with us!
<avatar_name>, remember everything we've\npracticed and how today's match felt.
You have the ability to turn Han Xin's\nLast Stand into the future of Furano soccer.
The future of Furano MS is in\nyour hands starting next year!
Give it your all, <avatar_name>!
Hey, everyone. Do you have a minute?
What's with the package, Matsuyama?
It was delivered from Furano MS this morning.\nIt's addressed to everyone.
Friendship bracelets for all the Japanese reps.\nThey're small, but they've even got our numbers\non them.
The ones that Furano MS were\nwearing during the nationals?
Machida wanted to do it to give\nthe team a little boost in spirit.
They were handmade by everyone at Furano MS.
Wow, that's great.
It's a good luck charm. Go ahead and take one.\nI'll pass them around.
Here's number 4. Ishizaki, take it.
Hey, why is the pattern on mine all weird?
Kato made that one. He's pretty clumsy. But\nyou can appreciate the effort, at least, right?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter. Doing your\nbest and looking bad doing it suits me anyway!
Next is 23... <avatar_name>.
You and me got headbands, too.
There's a message stitched on them.\n"Spread your wings from Hokkaido to the world."
Next is 23... <avatar_name>.\nLook, this one's yours.
Awesome! Thanks!
I don't know that I deserve this.
Everyone worked hard to make them.\nCan't you feel the energy emanating from them?
I definitely do. They're filled with\nfighting spirit. Hold it. Can't you feel it?
Alright, let's wear these bracelets\nduring practice today!
We'll stand united, just like Furano MS\ndid with their headbands back at Nationals!
Yeah, okay! That's the spirit, right, Matsuyama?!
I kinda dig this.
Yeah, it was a great idea.
Gonna fight wit all Furano's got!
It's okay from time to time, right?
Thanks, everyone.\nI'm sure they'll be thrilled to hear it.
The are imbued with the spirit of everyone at\nFurano. We'll have to do our best to live up to\nthem.
Alright, everyone! Let's get going!
Okay!
Well done, <avatar_name>!\nYou really played with a lot of guts out there!
Maybe you're ready to learn this now.
My Feinting Tackle that faked out Tsubasa Ozora!\nListen up!
First, use an exposed tackle\nto draw out the opponent.
And when the opponent gets stuck, turn to him,\nchange direction, and leap into your preferred\ntackle.
It may sound like a simple trick, but it's\na tackle that was able to stop Tsubasa.\nIt's powerful if used correctly.
We can flesh it out more next time.\nDon't worry though. I'll help you however many times\nit takes for you to get it down.
<avatar_name>! Your fighting spirit\nand guts are on another level!
I can honestly say without a doubt that you've\ngrown the most over the course of this tournament.
I've been watching your efforts this whole time.\nI've seen you practicing my Eagle Shot time and\ntime again.
In time, you'll eventually be able to power up\nyour Eagle Shot into an even more incredible shot\nlike I did.
Any specific advice?
I'll get to that level in no time.
Advice? Hmm... Well, it comes from hard work.\nIt's kind of hard to put it into words.
That's the spirit!
I don't have the kind of talent that Tsubasa and\nHyuga have, so I had to rely on muscle memory.\nYou, on the other hand...
My advice to you for the Eagle Shot and in general\nwould be to work on your lower body strength.
Consistent effort will definitely bear fruit.\nJust keep taking shot after shot after shot.
Training yourself might seem like a long slog,\nbut it's really the quickest way to improve.
Don't worry. If you find yourself stuck\nat some point, you can always talk to me.\nI am your captain after all.
But we won't be able to talk as much when we get\nback to Japan. I do suppose I'll always be only\na phone call away, though.
I believe you can do anything if you put your mind\nto it. You're the type of guy who believes in hard\nwork, just like me.
But when you get to where I am now,\nI'll have been working hard, too.\nIt won't be easy to surpass me!
Oh hey, you're <avatar_name>, right? What's up?
I'm here to show you how much\nmy practice has paid off!
See how much grittier my play's become!
I can hardly wait. Let's see what ya got!
Grittier? Okay then, show me what you've got.
Putting the ball there of all places,\n<avatar_name>... You're not seriously—
That was my longshot!\nYou mastered it this quickly?!
I see.\nSo you worked hard at training your lower\nbody and practicing your shot like I showed you.
I have no intention of losing to anyone unwilling\nto put in their due diligence, but that's\ndefinitely not you. You're really something!
With how good you are right now, I wouldn't be\nsurprised in the least if you were chosen to\nrepresent Japan.
I'm shooting for that, too,\nso let's do our best to make it happen!
With how good you are right now, I wouldn't be\nsurprised in the least if you were chosen to\nrepresent Japan.
We're in different groups so we won't get a\nchance, but I'd love to take you on for real\nsomeday.
So, let's both do our best and meet again as reps!
Oh hey, you're <avatar_name>, right? What's up?
I'm here to show you how much\nmy practice has paid off!
See how much grittier my play's become!
I can hardly wait. Let's see what ya got!

Let's make it a match to remember!
I was sure the match against Toho Academy would be\nall about me and Hyuga, but I'm looking forward to\nfacing off against you, as well.
Let's make it a match to remember!
I was thinking that this time we'd shut out\nTsubasa and make up for our loss to Nankatsu\nat Nationals.
But it looks like I need to worry about you, too.
Of course, that just makes this even more fun.
Let's make it a match to remember!
Oh hey, you're <avatar_name>, right? What's up?

Let's make it one for the history books!
I was sure the match against Otomo MS would be all\nabout me, Nitta, and the Otomo Quartet, but I'm\nlooking forward to facing off against you, too.
Let's make it one for the history books!







Oh yeah!
Heck yeah!
This is it!
You're mine!

Excellent! I did it!
Boys, I did it!
My handicap won't keep me from fighting.
I'll keep it up until my body gives out.
You won't regret fielding me.
My heart grows stronger with every game.
This is for everyone who's supported me.
Victory is in sight! Zróbmy to!
We're doing good, but don't get sloppy.
This is just the beginning, everyone!
Let's take back the lead!
Don't get careless! Stay focused!
Don't panic! We're still in this.
Good work!
Nice!
Looking good!
That's... Not great.
Seriously?!
Stop them!
Nice pass!
Thanks!
Leave it to me!
Go! Go!
C'mon!
Over here!
I'm open!
Pass it!
I can do this, everyone!
I'll show you what I can do!
Follow my lead, everyone!
Alright!
Do or die time!
Got you!
Go in!
I'm ending this!
I'll show them!
I've got an ace up my sleeve!
This is it! It's now or never!
I've been waiting for this!
Get in there!
I know this'll work!
This one's mine!
Just passin' through!
No slowin' me down!
I see you!
So I finally beat you, Tsubasa!
As many times as it takes, Tsubasa.
I can hold my own with you, Hyuga!
So you've gotten even better, Hyuga.
I've not been sitting idly for three years.
You've improved over the years, Misaki.
I train hard, too, Matsuyama!
You've really improved, Matsuyama!
You gotta polish your solo play, Masao.
Maybe I've gotten a little rusty.
You gotta polish your solo play, Kazuo.
Your talent still has room to grow!
You've come so far, Nitta.
Soccer isn't purely physical, Jito!
I envy your physique, Jito.
Nice read Soda, but it won't work on me!
Ugh... So you figured me out?
In a battle of wills, I win, Ishizaki!
My hat's off to you and your hard work.
That won't be enough to beat me, Urabe!
Ugh. You're far better than I expected.
You're so easy to read, Honma.
Ugh. You've gotten good, Honma.
You can't beat me, Sanada!
You've come so far, Sanada.
You're no match for me, Ichinose!
I like seeing how much you've improved.
You've been played, Schneider!
Ngh. There's always a bigger fish...
You've so many weaknesses, Heine!
Oh great, now you'll be even cockier!
My technique is unrivaled!
So this is how the great Pierre plays?!
With this, the game's as good as over!
This blunder could cost us the game.
Don't disappoint me, Kluivoort!
I'd expect at least this much from you!
Your play is too inconsistent, Rusciano!
Ugh, is this really Rusciano?!
I'm confident in my skills, too, Carlos!
Is this what Brazilian players are?
I can handle myself, too, Diaz!
Looks like you're the real deal, Diaz!
I've got you figured out, Victorino!
What a flexible play style. Not bad.
You're still no match for me, Senghor!
I'll win the next one, Senghor!
I've done my research on you, too, Ryan!
Ryan... Such crazy talent.
I've known plenty like you, Blake!
Such power... But of course, it's Blake!
Don't worry... My heart's still beating.
I'll be playing, even from the bench.
My dream is always to be on the field.
Don't worry! I'll be fine.
I've one last thing to do.
Junior Youth World Challenge\nScrimmage Japan vs. America
(Misaki knows how to work with Tsubasa, and\nputting him at midfield established the pattern\nfor Japanese soccer.)
(And I believe that assigning Matsuyama as a\ndefender will solidify our defense and give\nshape to our defensive formation.)
(Still... I'm worried.)
(Matsuyama may have gotten good, but he's still an\non-the-fly defender. He still lacks some polish.)
(But he has the makings of a defensive coordinator\nin him with his sharp eyes, quick thinking,\nprecision, and tenacity against opponents.)
(Jito and Soda are good duelers, which is why\nthey'll be in charge of pinning down enemy aces.\nThat's why I want Matsuyama to supervise defense.)
(And to do that, he needs the necessary experience\nand knowledge to coordinate the defense.)
(The only experience I have is from practice\nmatches, but I’ve got the theory down...)
(It probably would be for the best if I were to\ntell him.)
(I've been leading on defense using strategies\nlike offside traps since grade school.)
(There isn't much time before the tournament,\nbut it'll be enough. Passing my knowledge and\nexperience should at least help him a little.)
...With that said, I'd like the regular attackers\non Team A for today's practice and the defenders\non Team B.
I'd like to be on Team B, so I can observe the\nattackers' balance while seeing how the defense\nhandles them.
Hmm... I see what you're after, but are you sure\nyou're ready for that after the Junior Hero\nLeague? You still seem a bit run down.
Aggressive attacks might be out of the question,\nbut if I go on defense and focus on defensive\nplays, I should be fine playing for one half.
Hmm... All right, if you say so.
But no pushing yourself too hard. I'll call off\nthe play immediately if you show any signs you're\ngetting burned out. Got it?
Yes, sir!
...And there you have it. You understand the plan\nfor today's practice match? You'll be commanding\nthe defense, Matsuyama.
Wakashimazu will track Matsuyama's plays and\npoint out routes for shots and followups.\nI'll make my reads from that to block shots.
You guys got that?
You bet. I'm your man.
I f-follow, but why me?
It's true that we did well against Germany and\nUruguay to a certain extent, but I wasn't used to\nit, so I just did everything I could, that's all.
If you need a captain for the team, why not have\nJito or Soda step in instead? I mean, they're\nalready primarily defenders, right?
Yeah, you're not wrong.
But Jito and Soda were the types who led the team\nto victory by dueling against aces.\nOn the middle school team, that is.
If these reps do the same or focus more on facing\naces, I believe it'll make the team stronger.
And there's something more... I sense something\nextraordinary in you. I imagine it's the part of\nyou that never backs down.
Well, I mean, it doesn't sound so bad coming from\nyou, but I wish I had your confidence.
Well, you've still got things to work on.\nI'm hoping I can help you with that.
I see. I won't deny I could be better,\nand I want to be.
So just keep relying on me, Misugi!
You got it.
As for you, Wakashimazu, tell me what to do,\nbut I'll let you know later if I see any room for\nimprovement.
Yeah, I'm on it. I'd like to think I know a bit\nabout how offense works.
Okay, then let's get this show on the road.
(Plus, it'll also give me an opportunity to find\nout just how good I can play in my current state.)
(I'm here in America not just as a coach,\nbut as a player, too.)
You did great, you guys.
I did my best, but today's defenders were even\nbetter. I couldn't have done it without them.
Yeah. I think we pulled off some nice teamwork\nthanks to how hard everyone played.
And a big part of why I was able to focus on\nthe defensive line today was because we had you\nblocking shots, Misugi.
I think this is enough for today. We've still got\nsome time until the big match, after all.\nWe'll be able to hone our skills a little more.
Though we didn't manage to keep the team\nscoreless, you guys weren't bad out there.
I'm sorry about that. It seems I'm still not\nentirely on the same page as the defense.
We've got plenty of hurdles left.\nWe even had you as a shotblocker, yet we couldn't\npull off a shutout.
I still can't do the stuff you taught me, either.
It's okay. I think this is enough for today.\nWe've still got some time until the big match,\nafter all. We just have to keep practicing.
Besides, I still learned a lot today myself.\nYou sure made some interesting observations,\nWakashimazu.
I guess... Maybe it's because I contribute more to\noffense than normal keepers.
I think that unique trait is one of your top\nassets.
Also, go over the entire formation and everyone's\nroles with all the defenders one more time.
I've decided to teach everyone as much as I can\nabout those offside traps I've specialized in\nsince elementary school.
An offside trap, eh?\nYeah, I can see that becoming a powerful weapon.
I'd like you to learn first, Matsuyama.
For me?
Matsuyama, there's no one who'd deny your eye for\nstrategy or your leadership skills.\nYou can absolutely master this.
It's a lot of pressure for an impromptu defender\nlike myself, but if you insist, I guess I have to.\nOkay. I'll give it all I've got.
Yeah. I'm counting on you.
I'd like you to learn first, Matsuyama.\nBe sure you learn how to line up your breathing\nwith the rest of your timing.
H-Hold on! You sure you want to teach that\nto someone who'll be your rival someday?
But we're on the same side for now, right? A coach\ndoesn't let stuff like that get in the way.
I see... You're right.\nThen, teach me your ways, Misugi.
You got it.
(Whew, today's match is over, yet I don't feel all\nthat worn out.)
(I feel like I'd be perfectly fine playing another\nthirty-minute half.)
(Did I do something differently from what\nI usually do?)
(Today, I drilled my plays, did followups on long\nshots, and worked with the defense, focusing on\nhow my opponents executed their offensive plays.)
(Did I decrease the burden on my body by narrowing\nmy range of plays and focusing?)
(If that's the case, it's possible I could play\nfull games by devoting myself solely to defense.)
(Looks like I'll need to test this out.)
(Hmm... Could Misugi be...?)
Junior Youth World Challenge Preliminaries,\nBlock A, Japan vs. Italy
Phew... How're you holding up, Misugi?
Perfectly fine, thanks.\nI'm making sure to keep myself from burning out.
Anyway, you really gave it your all out there, eh\nMatsuyama? You're playing better than I expected.
Well, it's the position I was given, even if I'm\nnot used to it. I'd feel bad if I didn't do my\nbest for those who didn't make it here.
Besides, giving it everything I've got is about\nall I have going for me.
I see. I love a reliable player. I believe that\ndevotion of yours is a part of the reason our\nteam won the first match.
I just did what I could to keep up. The reason we\nwon is because Tsubasa and Misaki took command of\nthe midfield while Hyuga whupped Hernandez.
But the ones who supported the frontline were you\ndefenders and Matsuyama directing the flow.
When I watched everyone in that match, I really\ngot the sense that we were becoming one heck of\na unified team.
Now, I won't have to push myself. I can watch the\nmatches from the bench and focus on going out\nthere as a super sub, like in the prelims.
Can I ask you something personal, Misugi?\nYou haven't given up on playing games all the\nway through, have you?
...
All you've been doing is helping me practice, but\nif there's actually something I can do to lend you\na hand...
No need to worry. I'd like to think I have a good\nunderstanding why I was selected as a\nrepresentative player.
I'm confident I can swing the game our way when\nI'm sent out onto the field, no matter how bad it\nlooks. I wear this uniform because that's my role.
I see. Sorry, I know I shouldn't have asked.
Nah, don't worry about it.\nLet's just focus on this tournament for now.
(I am indeed ready for that. However...)
(My body's never felt the way it did after that\npractice match where I played defense.)
(If I really was in great shape that day and it\nwasn't just a fluke, there's a chance I could play\nmatches in full.)
(I can't be a burden on the team. I need to make\nsure my condition is perfect at all times so that\nI can play when I'm needed.)
(And I know that, but...)
Man, that guy really puts in the work.
He hits the pitch before we do.\nAnd look, he's still training that hard, even now.
You're right. He spares no effort trying to stand\nout among the other reps.
He often comes to me with questions, and I hear he\nvisits teams from around the world to learn other\nplayers' techniques.
He's driven. But you know, he's giving himself\nmore options by pursuing the game that way.
I felt my own potential expand with my experience\non defense. Granted, I was sort of thrust into\nthat position.
(Expanding your potential...)
(...I see, my possibilities are what I carve\nfor myself. I might’ve forgotten that.)
(Super subs are key players for a team, but if\nI can play the whole game, then that'll expand my\nrole on the team.)
(Also, it'll be good for my career to look into\nways to play a match from start to finish in the\nfuture!)
Something wrong, Misugi? You got real quiet on us.
Oh, nah, it's nothing.
Anyway, why don't we get back to practicing so we\ndon't lose to him?
Yeah, good thinking.
Excuse me.
Well hey, if it isn't Misugi.\nPractice isn't over yet, is it?
No. I just wanted to have a word with you.
Really? That's not something I hear every day.\nOut with it, then.
...And perhaps because I played defense in the\npractice match before the big game, the burden on\nmy body after the match was way less.
It could've been a fluke. Or maybe...
Anyway, if there's a possibility I could play a\nmatch from start to finish, then I'd like to find\nout for sure.
So I came to ask if you could put me in on defense\nfor today's practice match.
Hmm... I see what you're saying.
I perfectly understand what you're trying to tell\nme as a player.
But I also want to hear what you think as a coach.
Huh?
To a coach, Misugi the player is a superb athlete\nwho almost never leaves any openings on offense or\ndefense, even if he can't play for long.
Doesn't Misugi the coach think it'd be a waste\nto use a player like that for defense only?
Objectively speaking, you have a point.
It sounds like we're of the same mind, then.
In which case, I'd like for Misugi the player to\nfocus on offense in today's practice match,\neven though he'll only be in for half the game.
What?
I believe that you have a habit of trying to do\ntoo much since you're so good at everything.
Unlike Musashi, where you were expected to play\noffense and defense as an ace, this is a gathering\nof stars representing middle school soccer.
So if you limit yourself to just one role,\ndon't you think you'll be able to avoid burdening\nyourself, offense or defense?
I don't know if I can pull off something I haven't\ntried...
But I'd like to give it a shot.
That's the spirit.\nThen, I'll pick today's team with that in mind.
I'd like to see how much the stress on your body\nchanges from you focusing on offense today the\nsame way you stuck to defense before.
That said, don't overdo it. I'll stop you right\naway if I notice something's wrong.
Yes, sir!
Misugi! That was some decent play. You managed to\nkeep the intensity high, even if it wasn't at\nquite the usual level.
So, tell me...\nHow do you feel now that the match is over?
Well... To tell the truth, it feels more tiring\nand taxing than before, when I was playing on\ndefense.
I see.
The constant dribbling and quick changes in play\nseem to be more demanding on my body than when\nrunning defense.
But it's less taxing than playing the way\nI usually do, that's for sure.
If I manage to keep this up...
Hold your horses there. You know the situation.\nAnd you know you're better off taking it slow\nand steady.
You're a smart player. I know you can figure out\nwhat your role ought to be, and what you're meant\nto do. If you can play a whole game...
Right... Sorry. I got a glimpse of my potential\nand got carried away.
I know how you must be feeling,\nbut it's better to take it slow.
We haven't finished the gameplan simulation for\nthe Netherlands match but...
...Depending on your condition,\nyou'll have plenty of opportunities to play.
Really?
You want to see if your best is good enough\nagainst the Netherlands, your role models,\ndon't you?
It'll all be for nothing if you try too hard and\nyour health takes a nosedive. I want you to devote\nyourself to maintaining your form for now.
I will! I'll make certain I stay in perfect form!
Good. I expect no less.
(He's usually more composed than most adults,\nbut he sure acts like an excited kid in these\nsituations.)
(I can't train too hard if I want to stay in\nproper shape for the Netherlands match.)
(Doesn't mean I can't use my mind.\nLet me collect my thoughts.)
(It goes without saying, but if I'm going to play\nfull games, I'll need to maintain a certain level\nof strength in my plays.)
(I'll probably need to play with a good balance of\noffense and defense while considering how each\naffects my body.)
(Then, the important thing will be choosing the\nplays I need to make and where to put in extra\neffort for each scenario.)
(And there are few that can do that better than\nMisaki.)
(He's exceedingly good at knowing when to attack\nor defend and pulling out just the right moves.\nMaybe there's a trick to it he could share.)
(I should take advantage of the fact that\nwe're playing together and ask him directly.)
Misaki, do you have a minute?
Hey, Misugi. What's up?
Well, you see...
...That about sums it up. Maybe you were expecting\nsome kind of technique, but I don't really play\nwith anything like that in mind.
It's okay. What you said was very helpful.\nIt makes sense why the team does better with\nyou on it.
That's pretty awesome to hear from you.\nSo, all set?
Yes. Thanks.
(Interesting... If I can apply that to my game,\nit should take it up a notch.)
(And I'll be able to make my dream a reality:\nplaying a full game at the international level!)
(That said... I'll have to put off trying what\nI just talked about with Misaki.)
(I want to attempt to play at full power at the\nNetherlands game, assuming I get to play at all.)
(So... I'll have to hold off working towards\nstaying in play for an entire game for now.)
(I must put all my focus on this match against the\nNetherlands!)
Junior Youth World Challenge Preliminaries,\nLeague A, Japan vs. Netherlands
That was it! I did it!
Junior Youth World Challenge,\nThe Day After the Preliminaries
(After the win against Senegal, we've won all our\npreliminary matches. That's the best outcome we\ncould've hoped for.)
(I think we have an ideal team. We have Tsubasa at\nthe core, but there were others who played a major\npart in each match.)
(Hyuga popped off in the Italy match,\nand Matsuyama tore it up against Senegal.)
(And, to toot my own horn, I think I did some fine\nwork in the Netherlands match.)
(It made me feel quite confident that my best is\ngood enough for the world stage.)
(Then again, considering the stress it put my body\nthrough, I doubt I'd be able to play at that level\nfor a full game.)
(My role as a rep became obvious during the match.\nI'm a super sub who turns the tide in Japan's\nfavor.)
(I had a lot of ideas about playing full matches,\nbut to put the team first, I'll have to set that\ndream aside. Wish I didn't have to but, oh well.)
Misugi! Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, what is it?
If you don't have anything else going on, could\nyou coach me for a bit and check out a play?
Sure. I'm available.
I'm surprised, though.\nWouldn't expect you to come to me.
Yeah, well, you-know-who's been improving\nat breakneck speed.
Heh, I see. Seeing someone younger growing\nso quickly lit a fire under your butt.
I guess that's one way to put it.
If you ask me, you've already made plenty of\nprogress since becoming a rep.
Of course! I'm not about to get left in the dust!
But that guy's not afraid to try anything.\nThat's probably why he's able to improve so fast.
So, I'm taking a page from his playbook.\nI hadn't really taken your coaching to heart\nbefore now, but I know I should give it a go.
Well, that's a good stance to take.\nI'll do my best to meet your expectations.
(Both Nitta and his "inspiration" are pushing\nthemselves.)
(Come to think of it, Hyuga and Matsuyama have\nused their defeat as a springboard to reach the\nheights they've attained as reps.)
(Losing the fear of trying new things...)
(I can't just settle for my current level while\nmy rivals and the young'uns work this hard.)
(I may have a hard time improving my physique,\nbut there are still ways for me to grow.)
(Maybe it's a little self-centered, but I can't\ntoss aside the potential I know I have.)
(I should explore it!)
Hello? Earth to Misugi.
What? Oh, sorry. Got lost in thought.
I can come back later if you're busy with\nsomething else.
No, no, let's get started.
Okay. Let's do it!
Alright, time for afternoon practice!
We're about to enter the finals tournament.\nThis is going to be the toughest competition yet.\nI want everyone focused on their own assignments.
Misugi, I want you with me looking at each\nplayer's movement. If you notice anything,\nyou know what to do.
Got ya.
...
(If the Netherlands match taught me anything,\nit's that playing a whole match at full power is\nnot going to happen.)
(As such, I'll need a new style if I want to play\nthrough a match as things stand.)
(I've organized my thoughts on offensive and\ndefensive balance.)
(Given my playstyle up to now, if I look at my\ndegree of exhaustion when playing only half the\npractice matches...)
(By focusing on defense in the first half,\nI could play a key role in the match and conserve\nmy energy at the same time.)
(From there, I can analyze the state of the\nopposing team from the pitch instead of from\nthe bench.)
(Then in the second half, I can put whatever\nenergy I have left toward an attack based on\nwhat I've discovered!)
(It's hard to be sure ahead of time, but based on\nhow my body's felt so far, I think I can just\nabout manage a full match... Probably.)
Hmm, is Tsubasa's movement a bit sluggish today?\nHow's it look to you, Misugi?
...
Uh, Misugi...?
(Although now that the team's moved on to the\nfinals tournament, matches will only get tougher.)
(Meaning if I want to ascertain whether or not\nthat style will actually be ready for a real\nmatch, I have to do it now.)
(During the next practice match, if I can!)
Hmm...
Hey, Misugi, I want to talk to you about the\nevening practice match.
Okay. I actually want to talk to you about\nsomething, myself...
I hear you. You want to play a full game, right?
Ah, I...
I could tell your focus on coaching had gone down\nduring practice. That's unusual for you.
I'm sorry.
I realize I'm being selfish but please...\nJust one match. That's all I ask.
I see your resolve. You'll play both halves of the\npractice match today, as planned.
I'll assume you found an answer to what\nyou've been mulling over since the scrimmage.\nSo, go out there and give whatever it is a try.
Th-Thank you!
You love the game enough to keep playing despite\nyour limitations. It's obvious you'd look for ways\nto play full games.
No one who loves soccer could blame you for that.\nYou know you have my support.
I appreciate that, Coach!
Keep in mind, though, that I'm responsible for\nmy players. I won't let you destroy yourself out\nthere.
If I see your condition take a turn for the worse,\nI'm pulling you out on the spot. Understood?
Yes, sir!
(I'm feeling weirdly nervous for a simple practice\nmatch. Sure hope this goes the way I think it\nshould...)
Whoa, you're playing a full match, Misugi?
Yeah. I'm giving it a go.
But I won't be playing the way I usually do.\nI'm still not sure whether I'll be able to do what\neveryone expects from me.
Don't sweat it. Even at half your strength,\nyou're trustier than Ishizaki.
Ah, shut up! I can play at least half as well as\nMisugi! I'll show you!
Ha ha! Don't stop at half!\nBy all means, outplay me.
(Heh. Well, I feel a little more relaxed.)
(Okay. This match is a big step toward a big\ndream. I can't hold back!)
*pant* *pant*
(My heart's... It's alright. I did it.\nI played both halves!)
(It was a strain on my body,\nbut I think I kept a good level of performance!)
(Switching off the way I envisioned worked like a\ncharm, too!)
Misugi, are you okay?
Sorry, didn't mean to worry you. I did something\nI'm not used to, so I wasn't sure how it'd affect\nmy body, but that's it.
I'm fine now. It's actually not all that different\nfrom a usual match.
Phew. You gave me flashbacks to the match with\nMusashi FC back in elementary school.
Do forgive me.
How are you feeling, Misugi?\nYou look a little run down.
I can't say I feel amazing, but this was a\nconfirmation for me that this approach lets\nme put up a proper fight.
Well, well. That's what I like to hear.
Personally, I believe for this tournament,\nI can play with all I have in whatever situation\nI find myself, whatever the role.
And my solid performance against Japan's regulars\ntoday proves it.
Is that "coach" Misugi's opinion?
Yes.
Noted. I'll bear that in mind, as coach.
The matches ahead are going to be fierce.\nI don't know where I'll be placing you, but\nI expect a lot from "player" Misugi all the same.
Yes, sir!
(Misugi, I've learned some things about you since\nthe Japan match.)
(Even though you're Japanese, we have a few things\nin common. Our aspirations and the number 14,\nwhich we both bear.)
(I also learned that your time on the field is\nlimited by a heart condition.)
(And more than anything, even playing as well as\nyou do, I saw your desire to improve is alive and\nwell today. You're a fantastic player.)
(Your strength...\nI think it comes from how you feel about soccer.)
(But my feelings are just as strong.)
(I've taken to heart the setbacks and frustrations\nI've faced in this tournament and they're going to\nmake me better than ever.)
(As someone who wears the number 14,\nI will beat you next time!)
(I'm looking forward to that moment, Misugi!)
I know it's a bit obvious by now, but you're\nrepertoire is really impressive, Misugi.
Yeah. If you look up the word "all-rounder," your\nface would totally be in there.
Seriously... You can do anything. I wish I were\neven half as good.
I've even had Tsubasa yell at me for being a\none-trick pony.
Jeez, that's gotta suck.
Um... Masao? If we don't work on it, they'll start\ncalling us the one-trick pony pair.
So you all think I can do anything, huh?
While I'm happy to hear you say that, I've been\nunsatisfied with myself recently.
Like, what can I do to enhance my overall\nperformance? How can I improve my physique?\nThere's no end to that list.
So how do you improve overall?
So how do I improve overall?
Hmm... It really varies from person to person.\nWhat works for me may not work for you.
But considering your playstyle, there may be a\nshortcut to developing your forte.
That's a good question.
In your case, I think one way would be to build on\nyour strengths.\nIt's sort of a roundabout shortcut.
Aimlessly trying to be a jack of all trades will\ndo you no good. "He who chases two hares catches\nneither," right?
So first, you should become a master of your\ncraft, polishing your specialty until you're the\nbest on your team at it.
Believe me or not, just give it a shot.
Łoł! Another amazing play from <avatar_name>!
Doesn't it seem like his movement has gotten\nbetter all-around?
You talked to him a little while ago, didn't you\nMisugi? What'd you tell him?
I just gave him some advice.
He's the kind of player that wants to do it all,\nso I figured surefire confidence in one aspect of\nhis gameplay would positively affect him overall.
He just had to give it a chance.
Such simple but sound advice.
This wasn't part of the plan, but it seems like he\nuses his head the same way I do.
What do you mean?
For example, whenever I improved my dribbling\nskills, I can apply that on defense, too, by\nthinking about how the opponent's going to move.
Or if my teammate has the ball, I can imagine what\nkind of support he wants from me.
Just being able to understand that perspective\nbetter helps me come up with more effective plays.
Makes sense.
And it looks like <avatar_name> thinks the same\nway. Or maybe he just does it naturally.
Developing your forte provides synergy overall.\nThat said, it's been even more effective for him\nthan I imagined.
Then, if we keep working on our aerial soccer,\nwe'll develop other capacities, too?
It very well could. This method just happened to\nbe particularly effective for <avatar_name>.
Besides, there's nothing wrong with hyper-\nspecializing either.\nBeing irreplaceable can be a valuable asset.
You choose what kind of player you want to be,\nand your team will supplement you no matter what.\nThat's the great thing about team sports.
Never thought of it like that.
Alright! How about we try it, too, Kazuo?
Sure thing, Masao!
(<avatar_name>... You could very well end up even\nmore influential a player than I imagined.)
(I'm looking forward to seeing how you'll lead\nMusashi MS next year.)
(And to the day we face each other on the field.)
(I'm looking forward to the day we face each other\non the field.)
Hi there, <avatar_name>. Looking good.
Oh, no, I didn't mean to interrupt your training.\nKeep going. I'll watch from here.
Hmm... I knew it.
So how was my shot?
Something on your mind?
You can certainly kick with all your might, but...
What would you do if there were a goalie here?\nThat kick wouldn't cut it, no matter how solid it\nfeels.
Do you imagine a goalkeeper or any other\nopponents when you're taking your practice shots?
To me, it looks like you're simply kicking it as\nhard as you can.
Even from the sidelines, I can easily predict the\ntiming and trajectory.
I'm guessing it's because you're putting all your\neffort into making each kick as powerful as you\ncan.
How about you try paying more attention to the\nspin on the ball, so its trajectory isn't quite\nas obvious?
Here, something like this.
Curve and course play into each other.
Ultimately, it's up to you what to focus on, but\nI want you to be aware of it.
Pure power shots have their place, but I think\nit's about time you took the next step. It never\nhurts to have more options.
Don't worry. I'm sure you have what it takes.\nKeep working hard.
Okay, next we'll be practicing direct free kicks,\nso everyone get to your positions.
Roger that!
Last time Misugi broke our formation from the\nside, but next up is a highball?
No, with <avatar_name> to cushion the blow, he\nmight be going straight in.
Either way, we need to watch Misugi intently.
So, <avatar_name>, what would you like to do here?
Let me shoot, please.
Hit it straight in.
I can see that you're confident.
Hmm, we won't break through that wall with a\nhalf-hearted shot.
But that confidence... Do you think it can work?
Alright then. I'll help give you room to breathe,\nso you aim wherever you want.
Okay, we're starting!
Huh? <avatar_name>?!
That was just like Misugi!\nSince when could he do that?!
I never imagined you'd use that free kick to take\na shot on goal, <avatar_name>.
I did tell you to pay attention to both spin and\ntrajectory, but I can't believe you mastered both\nin such a short time.
I'm shocked how good your instincts are. Looks\nlike I was right to keep an eye on you!
Although it feels a little weird to be happy that\nsomeone's stealing my moves...
Your effort is paying off.\nYou've got the combo of motivation, quick\nlearning, and excellent conditioning. I'm jealous.
With you on our side, Musashi MS sweeping the\nJunior Hero League is a real possibility.
And with a little luck, maybe we can start\nthinking about the tournament after that!
Let's do this, <avatar_name>!
You were... <avatar_name>, right?
I take it you're Misugi from Musashi?
What's Musashi's captain doing here?
Right. Nice to meet you.
Actually, I came here to see you, after seeing\nhow well you did in the last match.
After seeing how well you did in the last match,\nI got a little curious and came to see you.
But I see now... If you're that zealous about\ntraining, it's no surprise you'd play so well.\nI'm glad I came.
You're taking into account spin and trajectory\nwhen you're making those practice shots?
But you're putting too much force into it. Not\nonly will it not go where you want it to, the\ngoalie will be able to easily read its path.
Let's see... I'll show you what I mean.
Now, watch closely.
Something like that.
What you need is a sharp spin. That's more\nimportant than raw power. Dropping the power a\nlittle makes it easier to handle.
You're from Furano, right? It's slightly modified\nfrom Matsuyama's specialty shot.
You're from Toho Academy, right? This may be the\nexact opposite of how Hyuga does it.
Whoops, I need to head back soon.
If I remember correctly, your school hasn't lost\nany of the league matches yet, right?
Ride that momentum all the way to the end, okay?\nGood luck.
Let's meet up again soon!
Hmm? <avatar_name>? Do you need something?
I did what you said, Misugi!
Check this out!
...!
...!
I can't believe it! You gained that much control\nover the spin in no time flat?!
You have good instincts, and know how to use your\nskills in a real match. You seem to have both the\nright skills and attitude.
You are undoubtedly worthy of representing Japan.
To be honest, I've already been asked to serve as\na coach for the representatives, but I haven't\ngiven up on going as a player, as well.
Let's meet again as reps, <avatar_name>! And then\nwe can play on the same team!
You'll need to work on your skills and attitude,\nin order to better use your instincts in a match.
But those instincts alone are worthy of\nrepresenting Japan, in my opinion.
To be honest, I've already been asked to serve as\na coach for the reps, but I haven't given up on\ngoing as a player, as well.
I hope we can meet again as reps, <avatar_name>.\nLet's both do our best!
You really do have a great sense for soccer.
I've been looking forward to facing Tsubasa in\nthis league, but I think I'll have to add you to\nthe list, too.
Let's meet again on the field!
Looks like you've fully mastered that shot,\n<avatar_name>.
Is that the shot I taught you the trick to\nearlier, <avatar_name>?
Seems like you really put in the work and made it\nyour own.
You're amazing, <avatar_name>! Since when could\nyou shoot like that?
But the swing of your leg and the way you added\nthe curve... Don't tell me you based that on me?
When I saw you in the Junior Hero League, I\nthought your instincts for soccer could cut it as\na rep.
But even so, I never imagined you'd be a starter.\nYou've gained a lot of confidence, haven't you?
I knew you could shine, but I never thought you'd\nbe a starter on the All-Japan team.
Being on the starting lineup with Tsubasa and the\nrest must be a real confidence booster.
Back in the Junior Hero League you didn't seem\nlike much more than a promising first year, but\nlook at you now.
Being on the starting lineup with Tsubasa and the\nrest must be a real confidence booster.
I'm still pretty nervous.
I've always been confident!
Fair enough. There must be a lot of pressure,\nbeing in the starting lineup with all these great\nplayers.
It's reassuring that you still are, when you're\nsurrounded by all these great players.
But don't let your guard down. You never know\nwhen you'll lose your seat to someone else.\nThat's part of being on this team.
Anyway, I'm feeling good today, so why don't we\nget a little training in together?
But I'm not your captain here. We're on equal\nfooting. Let's just do our best together.
We're not rivals here, just two teammates. So\nlet's do our best together.
Okay, next up is a formation check! Everyone get\nto your positions!
Misugi, I want you with me to look over the\noverall balance. I'm counting on you.
Understood.
Practice the following day...
Okay, that's enough, Misugi! Takeshi, you're in!
But I can keep going, Coach!
Sorry, but that's not happening. There's no way\nwe're pushing you that hard in training. Try to\nunderstand that I'm worried about your health.
Yes, Sir. I understand...
Hey <avatar_name>.\nAs eager to train as ever, I see.
To be honest, I envy you. I wish I could be\npracticing this late into the day, too.
We're surrounded by the best of the best, yet\neven in this incredible environment, I can only do\nteam practice. All because of my heart condition.
I know I can do more, but they won't even give me\nthe chance. I'm not allowed to push my limits,\nlike Tsubasa or Hyuga.
I know that the coach and the doctor are right,\nbut it just frustrates me to have this body that\ncan't keep up with my desires.
There are so many things that anyone else can do\nthat I can't.
But you've got a head for soccer.
But you've got the most talent.
Thanks.
Of course, that comes from the time I've spent on\nthe bench imagining plays before getting to take\nthe field.
My head's just full of tactics and strategies.\nBut maybe that's my secret advantage.
No... People always tell me that, and it makes me\nhappy to hear, but I disagree.
Although I can see how it might look that way,\nwith this body and all the training I've done.
Maybe I'm getting a little pessimistic...\nEveryone wants what they don't have, right?\nThat's normal.
I really should be following your example. The\nway you stay focused on what's ahead of you.
Sheesh, you listen to my woes and then offer\nadvice? Who's supposed to be the captain here?
Thanks for listening. I feel a little better now.
Yeah...\nThere's no point in feeling sorry for myself.\nI have my own strengths, just like you said.
And I should do my best to leverage them, just\nlike anyone else would!
Hey, <avatar_name>. Perfect timing.
Let's skip team practice today and go scope out\nour opponents. Don't worry, I already got\npermission from the coach.
What? You can't just decide that.
Ha! I love playing hooky!
Sorry, but this is something I thought you needed\nto see for yourself.
In some ways, this is more important than\ntraining. You'll have to write a recon report\nwhen we get back, too.
Anyway, let's get going. And try to take this\nseriously, like it's another part of your\ntraining.
Okay, remember that feeling! That's the speed at\nwhich we want to be switching from defense to\noffense!
With me and Pierre here, coordinating that should\nbe no trouble at all.
Who cares! Just get me the ball already! I'm the\none doing all the scoring!
Spread out near the goal box, guys! I'll charge\nup the center once I pass the ball!
After that, just get me the ball, alright?\nDoesn't matter when or from where!
It's all you, Kluivoort!
(I'll never forget going up against Japan's\nnumber 14, Misugi.)
(But next time, I'll win! Just wait!)
(You're so much more passionate than last time,\nKluivoort. I can feel your determination from up\nhere.)
(But I won't lose!)
We're still a long way from the level we're\naiming for! We don't have time to rest after a\nlittle warm-up like that!
Right behind you, Kluivoort! We all feel the same.
Absolutely! So c'mon, cheer up!
Our next match is with Italy!\nWe'll never break their catenaccio without taking\nour offense to the next level!
Got it, Captain!
We may have lost to Japan, but we're still in\nthis!
Tighten up around the goal, so they can't get a\nclear shot!
If you get the ball, send it forward ASAP! Then\nit's all you, Rusciano!
I don't need you to tell me that! It's always all\nme! No one can stand in my way!
You can do it, guys!\nBreak their formation with quick passes!
Leave it to us! We'll follow you anywhere,\nSenghor! C'mon guys!
You got it!
Go, Diallo!
Your legs are your greatest weapons, boys! Don't\nthink about anything else, just run and leap!
Tch!
Well, that was interesting <avatar_name>.\nWe saw a lot of countries today, and just as many\nstrategies.
Ones built around an exceptional captain, ones\nwith unbeatable aces, ones with unbreakable\ndefenses commanded by a goalie...
Teams that rally around their key players...\nReally, there's so much variety.
Teams that exploit their athletic superiority...\nReally, there's so much variety.
And it's not just the strategies. Each and every\nplayer has their own personality and talents.
Even my body is just another variant.
Maybe I've been overthinking my condition this\nwhole time.
I have more time to observe than other people do.\nAnd I can use that.\nThat's the sort of player I am.
On days I can't practice, I study videos or watch\ngames in person. My head is filled with countless\nplays and tactics.
And developing that soccer in my head is my\nfoundation as a player. Whether I'm putting the\nstrats into practice myself or leading the team.
I only realized this thanks to you, <avatar_name>.
Jeez, you always surpass my expectations.
When you first joined Musashi, I never imagined\nyou'd influence not only my play, but even my way\nof thinking.
Jeez, you always surpass my expectations.
I never imagined you'd influence not only my\nplay, but even my way of thinking.
Hi there you two. Just got back?
Hello, Coach. Thanks for letting us do this.
So, did you find that helpful, too, <avatar_name>?
Misugi begged me to let you tag along, y'know. I\ndon't mind as long as you learned something.
I think we did, and I'd like to prove it in our\ngames from here on out.
(That's the look I want to see, Misugi.)
(I know it's been frustrating not being able to\nplay because of your condition, but you can\novercome that.)
(I just know it.)
Good to hear. I'm looking forward to your report.
Don't keep me waiting too long.
Okay, <avatar_name>. We can focus on writing up\nthe report after dinner.
And starting tomorrow, we can put what we've\ndiscovered into practice!
Come at me, <avatar_name>.
Today, I'll be teaching you my special feint.
First, you lightly hook the ball with your ankle,\nthen you turn in place while dodging the\nopponent's charge.
The movement itself should be easy enough with\nyour balance and technique.
But the hard part of this technique is actually\nthe timing.
Start spinning too soon and they can easily see\nit coming. Start too late and they'll get the\nball off you before you make your move.
And the only way to get a sense of how close they\nneed to be before you start the movement is\npractice.
So I'll be on defense and you dodge me, okay?
No! That was too slow! Again!
Not bad, but a little faster!
One more time!
Now you've got it! Remember that timing! In a\nreal match you'll need to pay close attention to\nyour opponent's movement to use it.
Hey, you two. Hard at work?
Hello, Urabe.
Seeing that feint really takes me back. Didn't\nyou use it to slip by Nakayama back in elementary\nschool?
Haha, did I? You've got a good memory.
Nakayama tells me it still keeps him up at night.
It left a pretty big impression on me, as well.
You'll hafta play at the same level as Misugi,\n<avatar_name>, to really get use out of that one.
Looking forward to seeing it in action! Good luck!
Still though, it's shocking how fast you've\npicked up on things. And the amount of energy you\nhave to keep going is ridiculous.
It's nice to know I can entrust Musashi MS to you\nnext year.
To be honest, it seems like I've been\nunderestimating you.\nWho could've imagined you'd get so good so fast?
You might even end up the MVP at Nationals next\nyear.
(It may be tough on my heart, but I can press on.)
What a nice, clean overhead.
I wish my form were that pretty.
Yeah? I do feel pretty comfortable with the move,\nhonestly.
Glad to hear it.\nI'm pretty confident in this move, too.
I could teach you the trick, if you're up for it.\nMy heart's still got a few beats to spare.
The technique you use to bring the ball in is\nwonky, which makes your aim and power unstable.
With a more stable form, more of your power will\nbe transferred to the ball, AND you'll have more\ncontrol.
A clean form is good for more than just looking\ncool; it has a practical purpose. Now, go hammer\nit out.
That one was perfect! Isolate that feeling in\nyour brain and body.
That overhead kick just now looked just like\nMisugi's, <avatar_name>!
Tsubasa. Hyuga.
For real. It was just as clean as his.
I would know. I saw it up close in the Tokyo\nregional finals.
I've been teaching him the trick to it.
He's a really quick learner. He's come really far\nin no time at all.
Whoa... That's incredible.
Let's go, Tsubasa. We've still got practice left.
Yeah, you're right.\nWe hafta hurry, or it'll get dark.
Looks like seeing your progress lit a fire under\nthem. All the better for the team.
Glad to see I was right about you.\nI can rest easy knowing that you'll put up a good\nfight with Toho Academy next year.
I was never able to make it to Nationals, but at\nthe very least you could use my move there.
Do you think it's odd that I'm helping someone\nwho might end up standing across from me on the\nfield?
See, having more great players just makes the\nworld of soccer more exciting. That's important.
Besides, it's somehow nice to think that I helped\nmy opponent improve.
Okay, I think we can leave it at that.\nI need my beauty sleep.
You can keep polishing it on your own now.\nMake it shine even brighter for me, okay?\nI know you'll make it work.
I've had a chance to watch you practice,\n<avatar_name>.
When you focus, your play truly shines.
You're fit to be an ace on any team you end up on.
What do you think an ace is, Misugi?
That's a lot of pressure...
Hmm, interesting question...
When someone's as skilled as you, of course\npeople are going to have high hopes for them.
You'll just need to get used to it, and don't let\nthe pressure wear you down.
As both an ace and the captain of a team myself,\nwant a little advice?
Ooh, I want to hear this, too! Mind if I\neavesdrop, Misugi?
Of course not. You should hear this, too, Takeshi.
I appreciate it.
First of all, both aces and captains should focus\non bringing the team to a win. You'll understand\nwhy I phrase it that way when it's your job.
Both aces and captains should focus on bringing\nthe team to a win. You'll understand why I phrase\nit that way when it's your job.
In soccer, the ball comes and goes. The match is\nalways in motion, it has a flow. And my job is to\nfind the current to victory in that flow.
Once you've worked out the flow and identified\nthe way to victory, then you have to be ready to\ntake full advantage of critical moments.
You have to use all your powers of concentration\nand completely devote yourself to it, being ready\nto hold nothing back.
Even moreso for me, since I only have a short\ntime to leave my mark on a match.
But it should be the same for you, even if you're\non the field the whole game.
If all goes well, you two could end up leading\nyour own teams next year.
I hope you'll keep this advice in mind if you\nwant to lead them to victory.
Thank you so much!
Even though your playstyle is the opposite of\nHyuga's, I can tell you care about your teams\njust as much.
Naturally.\nNo one is more serious about soccer than us.
Wow, we've got so many great mentors here,\n<avatar_name>.
It's not just Hyuga, but Tsubasa and Misugi and...
I'm honored you think so.
But after all that talking,\nI'm in the mood for some exercise.\nHow about we practice together for a bit?
Sure thing! After hearing your philosophy, I'd\nlove to learn from some practical application.
Someday... No, if all goes well, you two could be\nleading your own teams as early as next year.
I hope you'll keep this advice in mind if you\nwant to lead them to victory.
Thank you so much!
Even though your playstyle is the opposite of\nHyuga's, I can tell you care about your teams\njust as much.
Naturally.\nNo one is more serious about soccer than us.
Wow, we've got so many great mentors here,\n<avatar_name>.
It's not just Hyuga, but Tsubasa and Misugi and...
I'm honored you think so.
But after all that talking,\nI'm in the mood for some exercise.\nHow about we practice together for a bit?
Sure thing! After hearing your philosophy, I'd\nlove to learn from some practical application.
I think I want to entrust Musashi MS to you next\nyear, <avatar_name>.
So I hope you'll remember this advice when you're\ninspiring them, pulling them out of crises, and\nleading them to win.
If anyone can take Musashi to Nationals and take\nhome the championship, it's you. I believe in you.
Someday you'll be leading your own team,\n<avatar_name>.
So maybe this advice will come in handy when\nyou're inspiring them, pulling them out of\ncrises, and leading them to win.
As you know, I have a heart condition.
So when possible, I try to avoid blocking shots\nwith my chest, which is how I came up with this...
You know the momentum you need for an overhead\nkick? That same momentum can be used to block a\nshot, no matter how powerful it is.
But pulling off this block is even more difficult\nthan an overhead shot.
This is because the opponent's shot is going to\nbe moving faster than a teammate's pass. That\nmakes the timing much trickier.
You have to evaluate the opponent's shot and\nmatch its speed on reflex.
And to do that, you need have a firm\nunderstanding of the speed of your own movements.
Well, I say that, but with your skills I'm sure\n<avatar_name>you'll get the hang of it with a little\neffort.
I'll start with some gentle shots, so try to\nmatch them! Then, we'll gradually crank up the\ndifficulty!
So the white team is a point behind? You've only\ngot ten minutes left, Misugi. Can you do it?
Yes, Sir. Let me do it!
Okay. Takeshi! Switch with Misugi!
We've still got time to turn this around, guys.\nAs long as we stay focused, we'll get our chance.
Got it!
Time to solidify our lead!
My turn!
You just switched in!\nYou think you can keep up with me?!
Gotcha!
Wh-What?!
(I've been following everyone this whole time, my\nhead in the game even from the bench!)
Now's our chance! Time to charge in!
On it!
Misugi's incredible...\nHe did all that in ten minutes?
Yeah, he's definitely somethin' else.\nAll those beautiful plays...
It's like the mood of the whole team changes the\nmoment he comes on.
I realized this back in the Tokyo Regional\nfinals, but that guy can change the course of an\nentire match.
He's a real pain as an opponent, but there's no\none I'd rather have on my side.
Maybe it's because he's always switching in\npartway through, but he just instantly understands\nwhat his team needs and what he has to do.
It's not like things magically change when\nhe hits the field. Nothing's as convenient\nor miraculous as you guys are imagining.
You're right.\nAs a midfielder, have a lot to learn from him.
If only he didn't have that heart condition...\nNo, maybe that's the wrong way to look at it.\nMaybe he only is who he is because of it.
<avatar_name>. I think he's been a good role\nmodel for you since Musashi MS, but now that\nyou're reps I want you to watch him even closer.
<avatar_name>. This is a good opportunity for\nyou. As a fellow rep, I want you to watch him\nclosely.
I think he can be a good role model.
I'm not just talking about his play, either. You\ncan learn a lot from how he thinks, and how he\ncarries himself as a player.
My hope is that you can grow to be someone like\nhim, who leaves his mark on everyone around him.\nKeep working at it.
You had some nice movements in today's match,\n<avatar_name>.
But... something bothered me a bit. You were\ntrying to test something out in the middle of the\nmatch, weren't you? I think I can guess what, too.
Actually, I was trying your dribble.
Doing something new in a match was hard.
I knew it. It's still too early for you to use\nthat in a real match, but it could've been a lot\nworse.
I knew it. That was my dribbling technique, right?
You're right that it didn't go so well, but it\ncould've been a lot worse.
It's just... there's something you're missing\nabout it. One little thing...
Okay! Let's do this now, while it's still fresh\nin your mind! I'll teach you the secret.
Strike while the iron is hot, as they say.\nNow, listen close.
Yes, that was perfect!\n<avatar_name>That's how you need to do it!
Wow... You looked just like Misugi!
Yeah, that was beautiful, <avatar_name>!
Just how incredible can one guy be?!
I'm impressed.\nYou managed to puzzle that out so quickly.
Looks like I was right about you!
You're no ordinary player, <avatar_name>. It\nhasn't been long, but you're already growing into\na key part of the All-Japan team.
Maybe this is a strange time to bring it up, but\nthere's still something I want to teach you.\nMy trump card.
Please!
What...? Now?
Just what I wanted to hear. I'm sure that\nambition is the secret behind your rapid growth.
We can't do it here, though.
No, not right this moment. We can't really work\non it here.
I'll teach you when we get back to Japan.\nThat way we'll have all the time in the world to\nwork through it in detail.
I've already got a video of my techniques and\ntraining methods for you to study once you're\nback in Japan. I'll give it to you later.
You've surpassed my expectations, <avatar_name>.\nBoth as a representative of the future of soccer,\nnot just for Musashi MS, but all of Japan...
You've surpassed my expectations, <avatar_name>.\nBoth as a representative of the future of soccer\nfor all of Japan...
And as my rival.
I'll be playing soccer for as long as my heart\nholds out.
So I'll see you on that future field. And until\nthen, I'll be working as hard as I can.
I guess that's enough for now. It's almost time\nfor the award ceremony.
You're... <avatar_name>, right?
I take it you're Misugi from Musashi?
What's Musashi's captain doing here?
Right. Nice to meet you.
Thing is, you pulled off some nice plays during\nthe match earlier, so I came to see how you\nwere doing.
After seeing how well you did in the last match,\nI got a little curious and came to see you.
But I see now... If you're that zealous about\ntraining, it's no surprise you'd play so well.\nI'm glad I came.
You're taking into account spin and trajectory\non that shot you were practicing just now, right?
But you're putting too much force into it. Not\nonly will it not go where you want it to, the\ngoalie will be able to easily read its path.
Alright... Let me show you what I mean.
Now, watch closely.
Something like that.
You want a tight spin, and that takes a quick\nswing rather than raw power. Dropping the power\na little makes it easier to handle.
You're from Furano, right? It's slightly modified\nfrom Matsuyama's specialty shot.
You're from Toho Academy, right? This may be the\nexact opposite of how Hyuga does it.
But when it comes to Hanawa MS, every last person\nwill be focusing on the Tachibana brothers.
So, not to be rude, but they make the perfect\ndecoys. Keep that in mind and you should be able\nto score on your own.
Whoops, I need to head back soon.
If I remember correctly, your school hasn't lost\nany league matches yet, right?
Ride that momentum all the way to the end, okay?\nGood luck.
Let's meet up again soon!
Hmm? <avatar_name>? Do you need something?
I did what you said, Misugi!
Check this out!
...!
...!
I can't believe it! It barely took you any time\nat all to get that much spin and control!
You have good instincts, and know how to use your\nskills in a real match. You seem to have both the\nright skills and attitude.
You are undoubtedly worthy of representing Japan.
To be honest, I've already been asked to serve as\na coach for the reps, but I haven't given up on\ngoing as a player, as well.
Let's meet again as reps, <avatar_name>! And then\nwe can play on the same team!
You'll need to work on your skills and attitude,\nin order to better use your instincts in a match.
But those instincts alone are worthy of\nrepresenting Japan, in my opinion.
To be honest, I've already been asked to serve as\na coach for the reps, but I haven't given up on\ngoing as a player, as well.
I hope we can meet again as reps, <avatar_name>.\nLet's both do our best!
You really do have a great sense for soccer.
I've been looking forward to facing Tsubasa in\nthis league, but I think I'll have to add you to\nthe list, too.
Let's meet again on the field!
You really do have a great sense for soccer.
I was looking forward to facing the Tachibana\nbrothers, but with you there too this should be\neven more entertaining.
Let's both give it our best in our match!
I've had a chance to watch you practice,\n<avatar_name>.
When you focus, your play truly shines.
You're fit to be an ace on any team you end up on.
What do you think an ace is, Misugi?
That's a lot of pressure...
Hmm, interesting question...
When someone's as skilled as you, of course\npeople are going to have high hopes for them.
You'll just need to get used to it, and don't let\nthe pressure wear you down.
As both an ace and the captain of a team myself,\nwant a little advice?
Ooh, I want to hear this, too! Mind if I\neavesdrop, Misugi?
Of course not. You should hear this, too, Takeshi.
I appreciate it.
First of all, both aces and captains should focus\non bringing the team to a win. You'll understand\nwhy I phrase it that way when it's your job.
Both aces and captains should focus on bringing\nthe team to a win. You'll understand why I phrase\nit that way when it's your job.
In soccer, the ball comes and goes. The match is\nalways in motion, it has a flow. And my job is to\nfind the current to victory in that flow.
Once you've worked out the flow and identified\nthe way to victory, then you have to be ready to\ntake full advantage of critical moments.
You have to use all your powers of concentration\nand completely devote yourself to it, being ready\nto hold nothing back.
Even moreso for me, since I only have a short\ntime to leave my mark on a match.
But it should be the same for you, even if you're\non the field the whole game.
Someday... No, if all goes well, you two could be\nleading your own teams as early as next year.
I hope you'll keep this advice in mind if you\nwant to lead them to victory.
Thank you so much!
Even though your playstyle is the opposite of\nHyuga's, I can tell you care about your teams\njust as much.
Naturally.\nNo one is more serious about soccer than us.
Wow, we've got so many great mentors here,\n<avatar_name>.
It's not just Hyuga, but Tsubasa and Misugi and...
I'm honored you think so.
But after all that talking,\nI'm in the mood for some exercise.\nHow about we practice together for a bit?
Sure thing! After hearing your philosophy, I'd\nlove to learn from some practical application.
Someday you'll be leading your own team,\n<avatar_name>.
You might just be the only other person in Hanawa\nwho can keep up with the twins.
So maybe this advice will come in handy when\nyou're inspiring them, pulling them out of\ncrises, and leading them to win.













When people think Hirado MS, they immediately\nthink of Jito and Sano's combination shots.
So, not to be rude, but they make the perfect\ndecoys. Keep that in mind and you should be able\nto score on your own.




















Add that shot to your arsenal and use it well!






















<avatar_name>, I believe Sano will be leading\nHirado next year, but I also think you'll be\nin that spot eventually.

You were... <avatar_name>, right?
I take it you're Misugi from Musashi?
What's Musashi's captain doing here?
Right. Nice to meet you.
Actually, I came here to see you, after seeing\nhow well you did in the last match.

You're taking into account spin and trajectory\nwhen you're making those practice shots?
But you're putting too much force into it. Not\nonly will it not go where you want it to, the\ngoalie will be able to easily read its path.
Let's see... I'll show you what I mean.
Now, watch closely.
Something like that.
What you need is a sharp spin. That's more\nimportant than raw power. Dropping the power a\nlittle makes it easier to handle.
You're from Furano, right? It's slightly modified\nfrom Matsuyama's specialty shot.
You're from Toho Academy, right? This may be the\nexact opposite of how Hyuga does it.
If you look at it the other way, Tsubasa's Drive\nShot takes power. Even if you're both adding spin\nto the ball, the way you kick it is different.
Whoops, I need to head back soon.
If I remember correctly, your school hasn't lost\nany of the league matches yet, right?
Ride that momentum all the way to the end, okay?\nGood luck.
Let's meet up again soon!
Hmm? <avatar_name>? Do you need something?
I did what you said, Misugi!
Check this out!
...!
...!
I can't believe it! You gained that much control\nover the spin in no time flat?!
You have good instincts, and know how to use your\nskills in a real match. You seem to have both the\nright skills and attitude.
You are undoubtedly worthy of representing Japan.
To be honest, I've already been asked to serve as\na coach for the representatives, but I haven't\ngiven up on going as a player, as well.
Let's meet again as reps, <avatar_name>! And then\nwe can play on the same team!

I think I want to entrust Musashi MS to you next\nyear, <avatar_name>.
So I hope you'll remember this advice when you're\ninspiring them, pulling them out of crises, and\nleading them to win.
If anyone can take Musashi to Nationals and take\nhome the championship, it's you. I believe in you.
Someday you'll be leading your own team,\n<avatar_name>.
I'm sure you'll be leading the team next year,\n<avatar_name>. And when you do, I imagine they'll\nbe singing your praises the way they do Tsubasa's.
So maybe this advice will come in handy when\nyou're inspiring them, pulling them out of\ncrises, and leading them to win.
You're... <avatar_name>, right?
I take it you're Misugi from Musashi?
What's Musashi's captain doing here?
Right. Nice to meet you.
Thing is, you pulled off some nice plays during\nthe match earlier, so I came to see how you\nwere doing.
After seeing how well you did in the last match,\nI got a little curious and came to see you.

You're from Toho Academy, right? This may be the\nexact opposite of how Hyuga does it.
The shot's of a different nature than that of your\nace striker, Nitta, so naturally, the way it's\nkicked is also different.
Whoops, I need to head back soon.
If I remember correctly, your school hasn't lost\nany league matches yet, right?
Ride that momentum all the way to the end, okay?\nGood luck.

You really do have a great sense for soccer.
I wish I could've played against you, but it\nlooks like it wasn't meant to be this time around.\nToo bad.
But when the chance does come, it'll be\na barn burner for sure. Can't wait!







Haaah!
Woohoo!
I got somethin' for you!
Here we go!
Chew on this!
Go!
Get in there!

Heh... I don't even need Skylab.
You'll remember the name Masao!
Score one for-- No, I'm not Kazuo!
Heh. Guess I'm good enough on my own!
Man, I'm good!
Let's flip this script!
There's more where that came from!
Just some bad luck! We can still win.
Now, we just need one more!
Focus, guys! Focus!
This was just the prologue!
Right on!
Łoł!
I like it!
Uh oh!
Whoops.
Shut 'em down!
Now, that's a pass!
Hup!
Believe in me, baby!
Here I go!
I'm open!
Over here!
C'mon! Here!
Pass!
It's time you saw a REAL duo work!
Now, it's our turn!
We'll show 'em our power!
Time for a Twin Shot!
Skylab Hurricane!
This is our midair special!
Skylab Twin Shot!
We did it, Kazuo!
Yeah, it's like you were in my head.
This is the Skylab Hurricane!
We're masters of disaster!
Alright!
Thought I couldn't pull my weight?!
Jeez, I should've known better...
Remember to be light on your feet!
That's too much power!
I've got more than acrobatics, Misaki!
Gah! You're good, Misaki!
Betcha thought I could only jump!
Jeez, not bad Matsuyama!
I'm better than you thought, aren't I?
Note to self: watch out for Misugi.
No way I'm losing to you, Kazuo!
How am I gonna get you to listen now?!
I'm above you, Nitta! Literally!
I just got careless cuz you're younger!
Your name REALLY doesn't suit you!
What've you been eating, Jito?!
It won't be THAT easy, Soda!
This won't happen again, Soda!
Not gonna lose to some goofball!
Guess you just tried harder, Ishizaki.
Heh, you let your guard down, Schneider!
At least, I'm still a better acrobat!
You got careless cuz I was on my own!
Man! If only Kazuo were here...
You thought I'd be easy, huh Pierre?
Jeez Pierre, not even one opening?
Heh, I can just jump over that Shield!
That's why he's called Shield of France?
Well, that was a confidence booster!
Hmph! I wouldn't have lost with Kazuo!
Soccer's not a one man game, Rusciano!
Man... If Kazuo were here...
Heh, guess I'm better than I thought!
I can't beat this guy alone!
I'm pretty light on my feet, too, Diaz!
Whoa, you're quick, Diaz!
Heh... What's wrong? Is that all?
He read all my moves?!
Heh, betcha never thought I'd go solo!
You even studied my play without Kazuo?!
Heh, what a slowpoke!
Darn you, Blake!
The Tachibanas' air game is unbeatable!
Ugh! Man, my legs are tired.
My legs are more than ready!
The Night After the Third Scrimmage
Let's do this, Kazuo!
Idziemy!
Sweet. The Skylab Hurricane's good to go.
But, man, it's a big world out there. There are\nguys who had never seen our Skylab and were able\nto stop it like it was child's play.
You mean the America match, right? That was a rude\nawakening. Really drove it home that they're not\nmessing around at the international level.
Well, at least we've talked to Jito, and started\npracticing a new aerial technique, but man,\nthis is tough.
Yup. I know the plan is to master it during the\ntournament, but to be honest, I have my doubts.
I don't wanna jinx it, but... What if we can't\nnail it? We might end up on the bench.
Hmm. I have confidence in how we work together,\nbut Misaki made it on the team now, so...
Tsubasa and Misaki have that Nankatsu Golden\nDuo going on. Much as I hate to admit it,\nthey are kind of amazing.
Like, even in today's match, Japan was able\nto set the pace thanks to their combo passes.
Yeah...
Thanks to their plays, the team feels like it can\nplay more consistently against teams that used to\ngive us a really hard time.
Granted, that's great for the team,\nbut in terms of some friendly rivalry,\nthey are a major challenger.
It's not just them, either. That first-year's\nstarted breaking into the first string.
Oh, yeah, that guy. All sorts of players have\ninspired him. He just gets better and better.
Kazuo, we can't end up warming the bench.\nLet's be like that guy and up our game!
Tak!
Noon the Following Day
All right, next up we're having a practice match.\nGet ready!
Okay!
I haven't stopped thinking about it since last\nnight. In the end, our scoring ability is our\nmain selling point. That's what we should push.
Sadly, we're not up to dominating a match on the\nworld stage the way Tsubasa and Misaki do yet.
Still, even if we want to show off our scoring\nability, we're gonna be midfielders on the same\nteam as Hyuga and Nitta.
We probably won't get much of a chance to use\nthe Skylab Hurricane.
You're right...
...
Kay! Let's go with our Twin Shot, then!
Oh, yeah! Can't forget that ace up our sleeve!
Not to mention, we won't be able to perfect the\ntechnique we're training unless we keep at it.
Then let's try to use it to shoot as much as\nwe can today on top of the special training!
We did it, bro!
Yeah, we really nailed it!
Shoot... You guys got us good.
And we're supposed to be the most familiar with\ntheir Twin Shot.
I guess that's payback for Nationals.
It did seem stronger than it has been in the past.
That's what we like to hear.
You know, if we work on it,\nwe might be able to improve our Twin Shot!
That Night
One more time! Here we go!
Now!
Nice! Your timing launching us was pretty good!
I gotta say, your lower body strength is\nunbelievable. That you can launch us like\nthat is wild.
Oh, that's nothin'.
But yeah,\nthat's enough practicing as a trio for today.
What are ya talkin' about? I'm barely warmed up!
Unless...\nDon't tell me you guys are already wiped out?
No, we're doing this for your legs' sake.\nYou're the one launching us.\nThe strain on your body is way greater.
You're sellin' me short here. I can handle it.\nI train for this sorta thing.
Doesn't matter. You may feel fine right now,\nbut it's gonna hit you tomorrow.
We have a couple of horror stories from getting\nahead of ourselves and training too much while\nworking on the Skylab Hurricane.
If you say so.
Anywho, when it comes to this, you guys know\nbetter than I do, so I'll go along with it.
Thanks. We appreciate it.
And it'd be bad news if you got hurt on our\naccount right before the tournament.
Well, see you around. We're going to practice\na little more.
Oh? You two ain't headin' back?
Our jump timing was good, but we need more air,\nso we're gonna work on building up some strength.
Unlike the Skylab Hurricane, where you jump into a\nheader, this move requires getting in position to\nshoot mid-air.
So, the reason we need more of a jump than even\nthe Skylab Hurricane is to buy that time.
But this is more a problem on our side of the\nequation than yours, Jito.
Makes sense.
But how are ya goin' to train for that on\nyour own?
We're using the goal posts.
You're what?
It's a method of practicing we adapted from the\nTriangle Shot we used in elementary school.
We jump towards the goal posts, land on them\nwith both feet, and kick ourselves off of them.
That way, we can practice a motion similar to\nthat of the Skylab, but with much less strain.
Plus, we can also practice jump timing by kicking\noff both goal posts at the same time.
There probably ain't another soccer player in the\nworld trainin' like that.
It's a technique no one else in the world\nis using.
Which calls for training no one in the world\nis doing!
Well, dang.\nYou're an interesting pair of brothers.
Junior Youth World Challenge,\nAfter the Preliminaries in Japan's Dorm Lobby
Man, after seeing all those matches during the\npreliminaries, it's interesting to see the\ndifferent duos from around the world.
Germany's Schneider and Heine.\nArgentina's Diaz and Pascal.
Their combination passes were almost as fast as\nTsubasa and Misaki's.
France and Brazil had some crazy combos, too.
The passes from Pierre to Napoleon\nand Leo to Carlos were timed to perfection.\nThey made scoring look easy.
These four pairs are all the kind of team-up where\none player draws out the other's strengths.
Ours, on the other hand, feels more like combining\nour powers into one.
Truthfully, I'm hoping we can work on even more\ncombos together.
But right now, we've already got a technique\nto work on. We can't do everything at once.
So, let's focus our efforts on mastering the\nTwin Shot during this tournament.
Yeah. I'd hate for us not to get it to where it\nneeds to be. Besides, it'll be handy for the\nother move we're working on!
Okay, boys, next up is the closing practice match.
We're heading into the quarterfinals,\nso it's up to you how you want to do things today.
Okay!
Here are the teams.
Red team: Masao Tachibana and Kazuo Tachibana\nat forward.
Got it!
You two have shown a real fire for scoring lately.\nIt's been great to see. Keep it up.
We will!
Next, the midfielders are...
Looks like we're both forwards for today's\npractice match.
You heard the coach, Kazuo. I say we go all in\nwith the Twin Shot and score away.
That's the plan!
Wakashimazu's the goalie, though.\nHis reflexes are sharp as a knife.
True. If we try to wait until we're together once\nwe get the ball, he's going to be beyond ready to\nshut us down.
In which case... whichever one of us gets the\nball, the other has to get to the scene as fast\nas possible.
Okay. Let's be sure to do that and fire off a ton\nof Twin Shots!
We did it, Kazuo!
Yes! It went just like we planned!
You guys caught me off guard.\nAnd I knew that Twin Shot was coming, too!
Whether it was Masao or Kazuo, when one of you had\nthe ball, the other seemed so far off.
When Masao had the ball, Kazuo seemed a mile away.
When Kazuo had the ball, Masao was still far off.
I couldn't believe you made up the distance so\nfast to pull off a Twin Shot with that timing.\nThe speed of your approach was intense!
So, during the match, did you also feel like you\ncould sprint faster than before? At those moments\nwhere we found an opening, I mean.
Yeah. I betcha it's the effects of our goal\npost training.
I think that training is working our ankles and\ncalves a lot, giving us more power for sprinting.
That's definitely part of it.
But I think our decision to focus on using\nTwin Shots from the start was just as important.
You're probably right.
Maybe our feet started moving the instant we\nsaw an opportunity because we were so intent\non the shot.
Masao, Kazuo! Even for a practice match,\nthat was some fine work.
Let's keep that groove goin' and perfect that\nmove today!
Tak!
And then we'll debut our brand-spankin' new move\nin the match against Argentina!
Junior Youth World Challenge Finals Tournament,\nQuarterfinals,\nJapan vs. Argentina
Now's our chance! Let's do it, fellas!
Idziemy!
Aw yeah, time to let 'er rip!
This is it. Our new combination play!
The Skylab Twin Shot!
We did it... We finally did it!
It was worth all that work! Right, Masao?
Did you see that, world?! That's our new one-two!
Ah!
Japanese Practice Area that Night
Let's go, Masao!
Yep!
Ugh... That's not it.
We're putting so much force into it,\nbut if anything, it's even weaker!
You two are enthusiastic, ain't ya?
Hey, Jito! What's up?
I see you're still practicin' your Twin Shot.\nHow come? Didn't we perfected the Skylab Twin\nShot?
I know. We did, but that's not a big step up for\nus as a duo, you know?
What do ya mean?
The Skylab Twin Shot is only possible because\nof you.
It's a major weapon to have as reps, but we\nprobably won't be able to use it in the future,\nwhen we go to different high schools.
We need to improve on our own if we wanna stay\ncompetitive for high school soccer next year.
Hmm... I get ya.
So, since we already ironed out the Twin Shot,\nwe figured we'd try to power it up while we were\nat it.
But it's not working at all. We're kicking as hard\nas we can, but it's not changing much from before.
On the other hand, we have the Skylab,\nso we can't go getting too buff and heavy either.
I hear what you're sayin'.
...
Alright, you two. Let's go to the\nequipment storeroom.
The storeroom?
Oof... Geez...
Okay. Right around here should be fine.
Okay, putting it down now. One, two, three!
Phew. That thing's heavy as heck.
Hey, Jito. This is one of those sandbags they use\nin football practice, right?
I remembered seein' it here before. I'm gonna show\nya how to pump up your kicks using this thing.
That sounds pretty good, but...\nwe're using a sandbag?
Okay. I'm gonna give the sandbag a good kick.\nI want you two to hold it up and feel the impact.
Uh, okay. Got it.
This good?
Yep. First up, I'm gonna slam my foot home with\nall I got!
Haaah!
Ungh... That was intense.
So, that's the power behind your explosive kicks.
I'm gonna do another one. You ready?
Hmph...
Hyaaah!
Łoł!
So, how did kick number two measure up to\nthe first?
Well, the first one was awesome,\nbut the second was even more so.
The second one looked like a lighter kick, but the\nshock I felt through the sandbag was incredible.
Putting a ton of power into a kick doesn't\nnecessarily make it a good one.
If you're strainin' and still not gettin' a lot of\npower out, it might work better if you loosen up\na little and bring the leg all the way around.
That's what a guy I fought once told me.\nLo and behold, dude was right.
I see. So, you ease up and don't force it.
I figured if ya can't build up muscle strength,\nyou could still kick your kicks up a notch\nthis way.
Definitely. This seems more our style.
Thanks, Jito!
Nah, it's nothin'.
Okay, I'll go grab another sandbag.
Oh, don't worry. Just one will do.
Huh?
If we kick it from opposite sides, we can practice\nwhile watching each other's form, which might give\nus some ideas.
Not to mention, our physical strength is about\nthe same, so the sandbag will swing one way or\nthe other if our kicks' power doesn't match up.
But it won't if they balance each other out.\nThat way we'll also be able to judge and adjust.
Smart. You guys put a lotta thought into how\nyou practice.
Japanese Practice Area Several Days Later
Okay, practice match time.\nThe teams are as follows...
For the red team, the forwards will be\nMasao Tachibana and Kazuo Tachibana.
Okay!
You did great with your combination shot the other\nday. Hope to see more of that today!
Okay!
Next up, midfielders...
This is perfect, Masao. We're at forward again.
Yeah. It'll give us a chance to see if our special\ntraining has paid off!
And we'll be going up against Wakabayashi.\nHe's the perfect goalie for gauging our power.
Let's show them that the Tachibana bros can do\nmore than just acrobatics!
That was it, Masao!
It was! That was the Twin Shot exactly as\nwe'd envisioned it!
We now have one more weapon at our disposal!
That was an excellent Twin Shot, wasn't it?
It looked as if it was even stronger and faster\nthan our shot.
Yeah, you might be right.
Wakabayashi!
It seemed like they'd kicked it kind of lightly\nbut the ball's speed, swerve, and even its power,\nwere pretty impressive.
They have to have figured out some kind of trick.
Ya guys pulled it off.
All thanks to you!
I told ya it was nothin'.
By the way, why did you help us out with this?
We're going to be rivals again next year.
We've come this far and you still haven't put\nthose pieces together?
If ya get stronger, ya help me now on my team,\nand when we hit high school, I have some\nchallenging opponents to look forward to.
It's a win-win for me. Helping you helps me.
I see. I can understand that.
Well, we'll make sure to repay you for all this\ncome high school!
Good! I'll be waiting! And I'll be ready to take\nyou back to school again!
Alright boys, it's the moment you've all been\nwaiting for: your academic achievement tests.
It's almost finals, and you're giving us a test?!
Don't forget that you're still students.\nLearning is the main reason you're here.
I mean, I guess that's true...
Anyway, it's not the end of the world.\nI'll let Katagiri explain.
Ugh, for real? We're really doing this?
As important as I know soccer is to you,\nand you know it is to me as well, yes, we are.
That grin doesn't scream sympathy.
Was I...? Terribly sorry.
The thing is what you learn in school is going\nto help carry you through the rest of your life.\nIt matters.
Think of it as preparing for your future.\nI'll let Katagiri hash it out for you.
Okay, you'll start your tests now.
There are a lot of questions, and it might be\ndifficult to get through them all in time,\nso just answer as many as you can.
But don't worry, no matter how you do,\nit won't affect your grades at school.
Probably.
Probably...?
Like I said, don't worry about it.\nAnyway, split up by year.
Wakabayashi and Misaki, I want you to supervise\nthe first and second year rooms for me.
On it!
...
...
...
Too easy!
Who in the whatsit?!
Alright, that's time. Put down your pencils,\nand I'll collect your answer sheets.
That's all for today.\nI'll return them tomorrow once they're graded.
The following day...
Okay, I'll be handing your tests back.\nCome forward when I call your name.
First up, Izawa.
Coming!
So how'd you do, <avatar_name>? Me?\nWell, see for yourself...
Could you tutor me?
Oof, well, that's not too bad.
What? Seriously? Your score was that bad? Show me.
...
(I see. This... might be a problem.)
Okay, I'll help ya out if I can.
Oh, wow. You did even better than me.
I can't believe you were secretly an egghead\nthis whole time. I'll hafta study harder!
It's time to settle this, Ishizaki!
You're on! Bring it!
...
Well, you filled in all the answers,\nbut your score is kinda...
Oh shut up! S'not like you did any better!
So are we calling it a draw?
How'd you manage to get through them all in time?\nI didn't get anywhere near the end.
Well, Masao was sitting next to me, and he\nsuddenly started filling them in like a madman,\nso it kinda became a race, I guess?
You, too? I did the same thing.
Ditto.
Well, ya know what they say... If ya can't hit\nthe bull's eye, may as well try and at least hit\nsomething. Kablammo!
I mean, I figured I should try to fill in all\nthe answers at least.
I think your strategy was a bit unsound.\nLooking at your answers, you missed some\nthat I'm pretty sure you know.
Ha! The opposite happened to me.\nI got a bunch right, where I can't make\nheads or tails of the question.
All's well that ends well!\nDoesn't matter as long as you get the points.
Definitely!\nDoesn't matter how you get the ball in the net!
Well, maybe when we have our final assessment,\nbut for a midterm quiz that's kinda a problem...
It's certainly noisy over here.\nWas the test really that exciting?
Well, actually...
Oh? I see.\nWell, I can understand where you're coming from.
You can?
It's like in soccer. Even if you're not certain\nit'll go in, you still take the shot, right?
Yeah, exactly! I knew you're get it, Wakabayashi!
You're a genius, Masao!
Maybe that works in soccer, but...
Certified!
If you actually knew how to find the answers,\nyou wouldn't hafta justify such a wonky method.
<avatar_name>, maybe that works on the field,\nbut for a test you really need to study.
<avatar_name> is right. Soccer and school tests\naren't really the same thing.
Guess it's more of a competition thing...
Even in soccer, you really need your teammates\nto make a shower of shots work.
It's not a bad way to wear out a tough goalie.
What's going on over here? Some kinda argument?
Were all your scores really that bad?
Oh, perfect timing. Show us what you got.
Sure. We did okay, I guess.
You guys are... surprisingly smart.
What do you mean by that?
Agh, forget all this! Who cares about scores\nand test strategies? Let's get back to soccer!
Tak! Who has time to study when we've got a game\nto play!
And that's that. You coming, Wakabayashi?
Fine, fine.
But don't expect your kablammo method\nor whatever to work on me!
Say what?!
Okay, it's on! C'mon guys! Let's give him\na thunderstorm of shots to deal with!
Woohoo!
Pass, Daimaru!
Okay!
Hey, Daimaru! Ya gotta give it more oomph!
Ah, sorry...
You...!
If it isn't <avatar_name>!
Yeah... It's <avatar_name>, isn't it?\nI remember seeing you play before!
Hey, kick the ball this way!
Here we go!
Take this!
Yeah, I'm counting on you!
What do you mean... Take what?
Anyway, I'm counting on you!
(Wh-What's with this ball?!)
Hey! Thanks!
...
Thanks for earlier, <avatar_name>.
Sorry to be so abrupt, but could you kick\nthe ball around with me a little bit?\nI'd really appreciate it.
Let's pass the ball while running. Idziemy!
(I knew it...\nSomething feels different about this ball!)
Thanks, <avatar_name>.
The truth is that when I trapped the ball\nthat you kicked to me earlier, it felt\nsomewhat strange to me.
I came here to try to figure out why.\nPracticing passing just now gave me the clue.
Your play feels a lot like\nthat of my little brother, Kazuo.
Even though it's our first time playing together,\nour ability to time our passes well could only\nbe because I was able to read your breathing.
We'd make a great team!
I felt we were in sync, too!
We sure would.\nIt's too bad we're from different schools.
You did?!
That means we'd make a great team.\nIt's too bad we're from different schools.
(That's right! If our breathing is this in sync\nafter basically our first meeting... Maybe...)
Hey, let's practice again sometime\nwhen the opportunity arises!
There's something I want to try with you!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Alright!
Kazuo managed it, so I was sure I could do it,\ntoo!
I knew the two of us would be able to pull it off!
Bro, <avatar_name>, what's going on with you two?
Hey, Bro, what's up?
This is <avatar_name>. We met recently.\nWe've been practicing together a lot.
Oh, is that right?
I'm Kazuo Tachibana, Masao's younger twin.\nNice to meet ya!
But what are you thinking bringing him here?
Watch this, Kazuo!
Tell him, Masao!
Tak! Take a good look at this, Kazuo!
Should I really tell him?
Well, fine. The two of us have something\ninteresting to show you, Kazuo.
You and <avatar_name>? Could it be...?!
Yes! Yes it could! Here we go!
F-For real?!
You and <avatar_name> can do it, so it's not all\nthat strange for me to be able to do it as well.
Hmm. Yeah, makes sense.
Well, let's see it then.
Alright, we'll show you!\nHere goes nothing, <avatar_name>!
Wh-What the?! You pulled off a\nTwin Shot with someone besides me?!
When we met before, I had a feeling that we could\nmake this work, so I decided to put it to the\ntest.
No way...
Well, we're not attending the same school right\nnow, so it doesn't really matter if we can pull\noff a Twin Shot or not.
But we'll shock the world\nif we're both chosen as reps!
Tak! You said it! We'll be the Twin Shot Trio!
Reps... I don't know if I'll get picked,\nbut I'll do my best.
Do your best in the remaining matches,\n<avatar_name>!
Then, we'll all become reps together!
Let's do this, <avatar_name>!
Tak!
<avatar_name>! We'll make a killer\ncombination representing Japan!
When we met before, I had a feeling that we were\nin sync, but I had no idea we'd be able to pull\noff Twin Shots!
It's a good thing I trusted my\ninstincts and practiced with you.
I mean, you never know when you're going\nto find someone who's a good match.
Though we've practiced since coming to America,\nI didn't think I'd be able to pull off a\nTwin Shot with anyone other than Kazuo.
(And if we can do a Twin Shot, there's\ndefinitely one more technique we can do...!)
Would you mind trying my practice schedule,\n<avatar_name>?
I want to try the Skylab Hurricane!
I'm also interested in Aerial Soccer!
You... How did you know?!
That definitely has to do with\nhow well we move together.
You read my mind.\nI'd expect nothing less, <avatar_name>.
Just as you thought, I was hoping\nto practice the Skylab Hurricane with you.
In my opinion, you'd be better off taking\nthe reins than being a mere launching pad.
So while you can of course strengthen your lower\nbody, you'll need to strengthen your upper body as\nwell if you hope to keep it together in the air.
When doing the Skylab, it's really dangerous if\nyou break posture, and you could end up falling\nflat on your head.
I found myself in such a bind during Nationals\nthat I have no idea what would have happened if\nTsubasa hadn't hurt himself helping me.
I don't want that to happen to you.\nSo do your best, okay?
I've been shocked at how strong the rest of\nthe world has been since coming to America.
I was seriously surprised when America's Azwan\nso easily caught on to the Skylab Hurricane...
But there's something I came to understand from\nplaying against overseas teams and watching their\nmatches.
And that's that nobody else in the world\nuses aerial techniques like we do.
In other words, if we work hard enough,\nJapan can control the air game during matches!
Let's do our best as reps to make Japan\nthe best in the world, <avatar_name>!
Okay, are you ready, <avatar_name>?
Whenever is fine!
I'm a bit nervous!
Good to hear!
Don't worry! Believe in me and yourself!
Alright, I'm counting on you, Kazuo!
Right on! Here we go!
Here goes nothing, <avatar_name>!
We... We did it!
We did it, Brother! <avatar_name>!
Because you two were able to perform the Skylab\nHurricane, I believed that I could do it as\nwell...
Just trying it was enough to make me happy!
I knew the two of us could do it!
Which means you can definitely\ndo a Skylab Hurricane with me!
Alright! Let's do our best, <avatar_name>!
I never thought I'd meet anyone besides the two\nof us who could pull off the Skylab Hurricane.
The world is a very big place...
Me and Kazuo. Kazuo and <avatar_name>.\nAnd me and <avatar_name>.
The fact that any combination of the three of us\ncan do the Skylab is sure to cause fits for any\nopponent!
Tak! Japan dominates the aerial attack!
We'll show the world what our\naerial soccer can do!
Tak! The skies above the pitch belong to Japan!
Let's do this, <avatar_name>!
We're the perfect combo!\nIt's as solid as when I partner with Kazuo!
But it's still kind of strange\nif you think about it.
To think that we make such a perfect combo despite\nnever meeting until the beginning of the Junior\nHero League.
To think that we make such a perfect combo despite\nnever playing together before coming here...
It feels like we've been\nplaying together for ages.
Heh, it's almost like we're brothers.
The three Tachibana brothers!
I'm counting on you, Bro!
How interesting!
Kazuo is my little brother, but I don't really see\nhim that way. But you're actually younger and feel\nlike a little brother to me.
Oh, it's from Kazuo.
It says I should return home\nbecause it's time to study.
It's fine, right, <avatar_name>?\nWe don't need to study quite yet.
The truth is that we were both thinking of going\nto the same school, but it's times like these when\nbeing a twin is tough.
I mean, if just one of us fails,\nwe both look bad, right?
That's a good point.
You'll be okay if you have each other!
Well, people can't help but compare how we do\nin school. It's pretty tough being a twin.
I can't help but try my hardest when\nmy little brother encourages me.
Well, there's no use crying over spilled milk.\nTime to focus on my schoolwork!
But before that... Let's practice!\nJust a little more!
I mean, I can study for exams whenever!\nThis tournament is a more pressing matter!
Let's win this tournament!\nNo matter what, <avatar_name>!
I'll have you holding the champion's cup\nup in the Skylab!
I thought about this in the match earlier,\n<avatar_name>.
The rhythm of your passes matches mine perfectly.
It's strange how we time our passes\nin the exact same way.
I don't really know the reason behind it,\nbut my brother Kazuo is the only other person\nwith whom I've been so in sync.
There might be some sort of\npsychic understanding between us.
I'd love it if we could team up for the\nInternational Tournament, but we'll have to do\nour best to be chosen as reps first.
Alright! Us working together is bound\nto add some energy to the team!
Huh? You want to know about Hanawa's offense?
You definitely have a way with words,\n<avatar_name>.
Well, you'll be carrying the team either next year\nor the year after, so you might as well soak up as\nmuch info as you can before then.
Our offense is quite specialized,\nso it might not help you all that much...
But if you really want to hear about it,\nI'll oblige you.
Hanawa MS mainly leaves the offense up to me and\nKazuo, while everyone else commits themselves to\ndefense.
In other words, it's up to the two of us to get\ngoals. Our ultimate weapon is our ability to\ncreate opportunities to score as a team.
But this puts an enormous amount\nof pressure on the two of us.
Think about it. The whole team depends on us.\nWe can't let them down, can we?
So I try to get into a mindset where I can take\nthat pressure and use it to strengthen my resolve.
That's just how it has to be done.
You see?
Coordinated shots are difficult to pull off, but\nif the two of you can generate more power than\nusual, it's better than what can be done alone.
That's our style of offense.\nThough I'm not sure how much it'll help you.
But I suppose it could help\nif you found someone to work with.
This is the kind of offense that should\nbe combined with technical shots.
It's just like my brother said. If you can\ncoordinate it properly, you can utilize the\neffectiveness of the Skylab Hurricane.
At least, that's what I think.\nHow about you, Kazuo?
It's just like my brother said. If you can do\nthat, it makes the Skylab Hurricane all the more\npowerful.
Right? And that's why...
Ah, <avatar_name>. Perfect timing.
Remember practicing the Skylab Hurricane together?\nI've been thinking things over since then.
I've been thinking that technique isn't the\nonly factor in performing a Skylab Hurricane.\nThat it can be performed with power, as well.
And if that's the case, it would make\nthe shot even more useful.
I was thinking of trying it out now.\nHelp me out, <avatar_name>!
The two of us have been using the Skylab Hurricane\nin our attack for a while now.
But if you fire the shot with the same power\nevery time, your opponent gets used to it,\nand it gradually becomes harder to score.
That's why I've been thinking that Kazuo and\nI could mix it up a bit to make the\nSkylab Hurricane more effective than ever before.
Even if the shot looks the same at first glance,\nthe opponent won't be able to ascertain exactly\nwhat kind of power is coming their way.
So I've been thinking of coming up with a more\npowerful Skylab Hurricane that attacks the ground\nfrom above.
Help me practice it, <avatar_name>!
Alright, let's practice while\nresting our legs like before!
I can't work on this without someone to\nsend passes my way, so I'm counting on you!
Okay, let's get started!
Darn it! This is no good! Let's do it again!
Not bad... Not bad at all. But we can do better!
Gah... My legs can't handle much more!
Okay, let's rest a bit.
Alright! We'll get it this time!
Masao!
Yeah, that's it! That was perfect!
Thanks for helping out, <avatar_name>!
I'll teach you the trick to the aerial move\nwe've been working on later.
It should be of use to you even\noutside Skylab Hurricane!
Hey, <avatar_name>. When we worked on the\nTwin Shot during practice for the first time...
I felt like I could predict\nhow you were going to move.
Me, too.
Yeah, I could sense something.
So it was the same for you!
Oh? Maybe you're sharper than me...?
Like I said before, it's the same feeling\nI get when I'm playing with Kazuo.
But we're not brothers or anything.\nAnd we never even played together until recently.\nI wonder what it is...
Maybe you just work well together naturally.
Tsubasa...
Misaki and I are the same. We first met in\nelementary school, and we even breath at the\nsame time now.
So, even though we hadn't seen each other in three\nyears, we were able to pick up where we left off.
I don't really understand it, but Misaki and I\nare able to communicate without words.\nThat much I know for sure.
You and Masao are definitely like me and Misaki,\n<avatar_name>.
Knowing the relationship between Tsubasa\nand Misaki, his words are pretty convincing.
Alright, <avatar_name>! Let's be as productive\non the field as Tsubasa and Misaki!
Ninety-eight... Ninety-nine... One hundred!
Alright, that's it for the back muscles...
Hey <avatar_name>, you're here early!
Hey, so are you, Masao!
What are you up so early for?
Well, you know how it is.
I gotta get here early if I wanna finish my solo\ntraining.
I was just wrapping up working on my back.
Still got core, arms, hips...\nWell, basically everything else.
When we do the Skylab, the guy in the air gets all\nthe attention, but the guy on the ground needs to\nwork just as hard.
I mean, think about it. Do you think you could\njump as high as you can if your footing was off?
It takes more than strong legs to make it work.
As the guy on the ground, if I want Kazuo to reach\nhis max height, I need to use my back, my legs...\nbasically my whole body.
So while the move itself is, like, the flashiest\nthing you'll ever see, we'd never pull it off\nif we didn't hit the gym, as boring as it may be.
Hey, wanna work out together?
Sure, why not!
Y'think I'd be okay?
Good answer!
Eh, you'll be fine!
I can tell that kinda thing!
Anyway, we're starting with abs!
Phew, and that's all for today!
Man, that must've been tough, even for you!
But you stuck it out. Nice work!
I know that someday you'll...
On second thought, forget it.
Whoops! It's that time.\nLooks like everyone else is showing up.
See ya, <avatar_name>. Good luck in practice today!
Hey <avatar_name>, we're about to split up into\npractice teams, and there's something I wanna try.
You don't mean...?
Oh? What is it?
I knew you'd catch on quick.
Guess we're on the same wavelength!
Okay, listen up...
Hanawa MS Practice Match
Here we go!
Ready, Masao?
No, let's have me and <avatar_name>\ntry it this time!
Huh?
Here goes nothing, <avatar_name>!
I... I can't believe it!
Heh, nailed it!
You actually did it, you two!
I just figured if <avatar_name> and Kazuo\ncould pull off the Twin Shot together,\nthen maybe I could, too.
I knew the two of us would be able to pull it off!
That was crazy! You two are awesome!
That right there's another huge weapon for Hanawa!
Hey, mind helping me stretch, <avatar_name>?
Kazuo already headed off for his own training,\nor I'd have asked him.
Five... Six... Seven... Eight.
Okay, I'm good.
The way we play is tough on our bodies,\nso doing this sort of thing after practice\nis pretty important.
The stretch I was doing is something coach\nlooked into for us and had us start doing.
We owe a lot to him, really.\nNot many people would let us play the way we do.
Can't ever forget what we owe him.\nSomeday, we'll return the favor.
And what better way than by winning this thing,\nand tossing him in the air when we celebrate!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Alright!
<avatar_name>! We'll make a killer\ncombination representing Japan!
I felt we were in sync back when we started\nworking passes, but I never thought we'd be\npulling off the Twin Shot!
It's a good thing I trusted my\ninstincts and practiced with you.
I mean, you never know when you're going\nto find someone who's a good match.
Though we've practiced since coming to America,\nI didn't think I'd be able to pull off a\nTwin Shot with anyone other than Kazuo.
(And if we can do a Twin Shot, there's\ndefinitely one more technique we can do...!)
Would you mind trying my practice schedule,\n<avatar_name>?
I want to practice the Skylab Hurricane!
I'm also interested in Aerial Soccer!
You... How did you know?!
That definitely has to do with\nhow well we move together.
You read my mind.\nI'd expect nothing less, <avatar_name>.
Just as you thought, I was hoping\nto practice the Skylab Hurricane with you.
In my opinion, you'd be better off taking\nthe reins than being a mere launching pad.

I found myself in such a bind during Nationals\nthat I have no idea what would have happened if\nTsubasa hadn't hurt himself helping me.
I don't want that to happen to you.\nSo do your best, okay?
I've been shocked at how strong the rest of\nthe world has been since coming to America.
I was seriously surprised when America's Azwan\nso easily caught on to the Skylab Hurricane...
But there's something I came to understand from\nplaying against overseas teams and watching their\nmatches.
And that's that nobody else in the world\nuses aerial techniques like we do.
In other words, if we work hard enough,\nJapan can control the air game during matches!
Let's do our best as reps to make Japan\nthe best in the world, <avatar_name>!
Alright, you ready <avatar_name>?!
Anytime!
Will this really work...?
Good to hear!
Don't worry! Believe in me and yourself!
Alright, I'm counting on you, Kazuo!
Ready or not...!
Let's do this, <avatar_name>!
We... We did it!
You did it, Masao! <avatar_name>!
Because you two were able to perform the Skylab\nHurricane, I believed that I could do it as\nwell...
Just trying it was enough to make me happy!
I knew the two of us could do it!
Which means you can definitely\ndo a Skylab Hurricane with me!
Alright! Let's do our best, <avatar_name>!
I knew you could keep up with us, but now you're\njust showin' off! Man, the Skylab Hurricane, too?!
And it hasn't even been that long either!\nConsider me wowed.
Me and Kazuo. Kazuo and <avatar_name>.\nAnd me and <avatar_name>.
The fact that any combination of the three of us\ncan do the Skylab is sure to cause fits for any\nopponent!
Tak! Japan dominates the aerial attack!
We'll show the world what our\naerial soccer can do!
Tak! The skies above the pitch belong to Japan!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
We're the perfect combo!\nIt's as solid as when I partner with Kazuo!
But it's still kind of strange\nif you think about it.
We weren't even on the same team until the Junior\nHero League, and we already make a solid team-up.
Somehow, it feels like we've been playing together\nsince forever.
Heh, it's almost like we're brothers.
The three Tachibana brothers!
I'm counting on you, big Bro!
Ha ha, that sounds awesome!
Kazuo is my little brother, but I don't really see\nhim that way. But you're actually younger and feel\nlike a little brother to me.
Oh, it's from Kazuo.
It says I should return home\nbecause it's time to study.
It's fine, right, <avatar_name>?\nWe don't need to study quite yet.
The truth is that we were both thinking of going\nto the same school, but it's times like these when\nbeing a twin is tough.
I mean, if just one of us fails,\nwe both look bad, right?
You're right.
You'll be okay if you have each other!
Well, people can't help but compare how we do\nin school. It's pretty tough being a twin.
I can't help but try my hardest when\nmy little brother encourages me.
Well, there's no use crying over spilled milk.\nTime to focus on my schoolwork!
But before that... Let's practice!\nJust a little more!
I mean, I can study for exams whenever!\nThis tournament is a more pressing matter!
Let's win this tournament!\nNo matter what, <avatar_name>!
I'll have you holding the champion's cup\nup in the Skylab!
Hey, I noticed this back when we practiced\nat school, but...
The rhythm of your passes matches mine perfectly.
Even the timing of when you send or take the\nball... It feels like I'm looking at a mirror.\nKinda gets me psyched to play.
I don't really know the reason behind it,\nbut my brother Kazuo is the only other person\nwith whom I've been so in sync.
There might be some sort of\npsychic understanding between us.
I'd love it if we could team up for the\nInternational Tournament, but we'll have to do\nour best to be chosen as reps first.
Alright! Us working together is bound\nto add some energy to the team!
Hey, <avatar_name>. Remember, when we did our first\nTwin Shot during a practice match?
Hey, <avatar_name>. When we worked on the\nTwin Shot during practice for the first time...
We never practiced it before that, but for some\nreason, I was certain we could do it.
But thinking back on it, doesn't it seem, like,\na bit crazy? What was I thinking?\nAnd how did it work?!
Maybe you just work well together naturally.
Tsubasa...
Misaki and I are the same. We first met in\nelementary school, and we even breath at the\nsame time now.
So, even though we hadn't seen each other in three\nyears, we were able to pick up where we left off.
I don't really understand it, but Misaki and I\nare able to communicate without words.\nThat much I know for sure.
You and Masao are definitely like me and Misaki,\n<avatar_name>.
Knowing the relationship between Tsubasa\nand Misaki, his words are pretty convincing.
Alright, <avatar_name>! Let's be as productive\non the field as Tsubasa and Misaki!
Masao! Kazuo! <avatar_name>! I knew it!\nYour triple combo is bonkers!
We'd never have won all our matches without you!
Aw, c'mon... We were just doing what we could!
I mean, none of us could carry a whole team on our\nown, like Tsubasa or Hyuga.
Which is exactly why we had to combine our\nstrengths to win. Hard work and a little faith!
Exactly!
It's our bond as teammates!
You know it! Putting it all on the line like that\nonly strengthened our ability to work together!
For sure!
No matter how good the other team is...
They can't break what unites us!







Try this out!
Ooh, yeah!
Here's a bomb!
Here we go!
How's this taste?!
Punch it!
Time to party!























Captain!
Your turn!
I trust you!
Here it comes!
Woohoo!
Rock it!
Take 'er away!
Tsubasa!

Wakabayashi!

Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!

Azwan!
We're the kings of the universe!
I've got more than just Skylab!
Heh... I don't even need Skylab.
I'm Kazuo! Remember the name!
Heh heh, don't mix me up with Masao!
Guess I'm good enough on my own!
Man, I'm good!
Let's get this back on track!
There's more where that came from!
We can turn this around, I know it!
Just a tie! Let's go and win!
Play it safe!
We're just warmin' up!
That's the stuff!
Łoł!
I dig it!
Oh boy...!
Oops.
Shut 'em down!
Now, that's a pass!
Hup!
This'll be easy!
Time to fly!
I'm open!
Here, man!
Right here!
Yo! Pass!
Twin Shot ready to fly!
Skylab Hurricane!
Here's our midair special!
Skylab Twin Shot!
We did it, Masao!
Yeah, it's like you could read my mind.
Heh heh... See that?
We're the real masters here!
Nailed it!
I can act on my own, too!
Jeez, why'd I go up against Tsubasa?
Gotta be lighter on your feet!
Jeez, that power is just unfair, Hyuga!
I've got more than acrobatics, Misaki!
Gah! You're good, Misaki!
I got hops! And so much more!
Jeez, not bad Matsuyama!
I'm better than you thought, huh Misugi?
Gotta remember to watch out for Misugi.
Not gonna lose to you, Masao!
If it were anyone else, Masao...
Stay sharp! I won't be taken lightly!
I just got careless cuz you're younger!
Your name REALLY doesn't fit you!
Jito what the heck do you eat?!
It won't be THAT easy, Soda!
This is a one time event, Soda!
I'm not losing to some clown!
Guess you just tried harder...
You let your guard down, Schneider!
At least, I'm still a better acrobat!
How do ya like my one man show, Heine?!
Man! If only Masao were here...
You thought I'd be easy pickins, huh?
Jeez, Pierre, not even one opening?
Shield?! More like a low hurdle!
Jeez, the Shield of France, huh?
Well, that was a confidence booster!
Hmph! I wouldn't have lost with Masao!
You can't play soccer alone, Rusciano!
Darn! If Masao were here...
Heh, guess I'm better than I thought!
I can't take this guy alone!
I'm pretty light on my feet, too, Diaz!
Whoa, you're like lightning, Diaz!
Oh, was that it?
He read all my moves?!
Heh, betcha never thought I'd fly solo!
Did you research both of us?!
Pick up the pace, slowpoke!
C'mon, Blake! That's a bit much!
The Tachibanas' air game is unbeatable!
Ugh! My legs are burnin'.
My legs are rarin' for a fight!
I wonder what's for dinner tonight.
Same. I'm starving.
We're having a buffet today. It's all-you-can-eat.
For real?! You're gonna hafta roll me to my bed!
Make sure you thank the hosts.
You got it!
Ga ha ha! Food! Glorious food!
It's so hard to choose. It all looks so good.
Why choose when you can have some of everything?\nI'm having one of everything,\nand then I'm coming back for seconds!
Ha, if you're having everything then I am, too!
Shall we make it a contest?\nSee who can clear the most plates?
Let's find out!
Okay, this should be enough to start me off.\nNow, where do I sit?
Whoops, excuse me.
Watch where you're going, stupid.\nYou made me spill.
What was that?!
Whoa, deja vu.\nThis feels like elementary school all over again.
Sure does. Now, will you two calm down?
Hmph. You're lucky my hands are full.
Yeah, who has time to fight when there's so much\neating to be done? Can't let it get cold!
Whoa, you really filled your plate,\nhuh <avatar_name>? Let's eat together!
Heh heh. Time for round two!
Hey, wait for me!
When did you all turn into human food vacuums?
I mean, they said it's all-you-can-eat, right?\nNo sense passing up an opportunity!
Huh. Never knew you were such gluttons.
...
Okay, I'm going for seconds, too!
Phew... Now THAT was all-I-could-eat!\nMaybe a teensy bit more, if I'm being honest.
That's for sure. But I guess it was a tie.
Something wrong, Soda? You're not looking so hot?
What's wrong is I was trying to keep up with you\ntwo like an idiot. I'm gonna be sick...
Yeah, I think I may've overdone it.\nMan, these Tachibanas are always dragging us\ninto some kind of race.
Wait, so did everyone just about explode trying\nto keep up with them?
They were having an eating contest.
Ugh... I had too much, too.
Hey now, how is this our fault?
Take responsibility for your own plates!
You too, <avatar_name>?
I know we had the whole eating contest thing,\nbut what's your excuse?
They couldn't help it.
There's been research that shows that people's\neating habits are influenced by those sitting\nnearby, especially when it comes to quantity.
Oh, huh. It's kinda weird to think there are\npeople out there researching stuff like that.
I suppose. But the point is that even when you\ndon't mean to, your behavior can have an influence\non others.
Whoa there, are you guys gonna be okay after this?
Didn't we promise to practice shooting after\ndinner?
...Oops.
Well, you can come after you take some time to\ndigest. We'll go set things up.
Thanks! Sorry!
Oh well... Then, instead of going for as many\nshots as possible, let's make each one of 'em as\nstrong as we can.
Not a bad idea.
Guess that means the timing for our Twin Shot has\ngotta be tighter than ever.
You up for a walk to give our stomachs a chance\nto digest a bit before we dive in?
Sounds good.
...
What's the matter, Misugi?
No, it's just... Actually, my stomach's bursting,\ntoo. I feel like I'm going to tip over.
I know I said we'd practice together today,\n<avatar_name>, but I'm not feeling well...
I'd hate to get any worse,\nso I'd like to rest a bit today. Sorry.
I know I promised that we'd practice together\ntoday, but everyone in my family is sick...
I'm worried about them, so I'm heading home.\nSorry to go back on my promise.
I know I promised that we'd practice together\ntoday, but you see, I forgot about my summer\nhomework...
I want to prioritize that today. Sorry about that!
You...!
Oh, if it isn't <avatar_name>!
Yeah... It's <avatar_name>, isn't it?\nI remember your play from the match earlier!
What are you doing here all by yourself?\nVoluntary practice?
Actually...
Would you practice with me?
I see. So things didn't work out with\nyour practice partner. It happens.
Want to practice with me then?\nI happen to be free at the moment.
Yeah, sure.
I was planning on practicing with my brother,\nbut he twisted his ankle during practice,\nforcing us to cancel our plans.
Let's work on moving and passing. Idziemy!
(Wh-What's this?! This feeling when receiving\nthe ball?! I know it all too well!)
(And our timing is totally on the mark?!)
<avatar_name>, our passes just now...\nDid anything feel unusual about them?
We moved in perfect harmony.
It felt oddly familiar.
This feeling...\nTo be honest, I know it all too well.
I was thinking the same thing.\nAnd I know this feeling all too well.
The feeling I got when we were passing just now is\nvirtually the same feeling I get when I play with\nmy brother.
Even though it's our first time playing together,\nour ability to time our passes this well...\nWhat's going on here?
It is... interesting to say the least.
(If we're working this well together\nafter so little time...\nI'm sure we can do something spectacular!)
Hey, let's practice again sometime\nwhen the opportunity arises!
There's something I want to try with you!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Alright!
My brother managed it,\nso I was sure I could do it, too!
I knew the two of us would be able to pull it off!
What's going on, Kazuo?\nOh, so you were with <avatar_name>.
What were you two doing?
Huh? Who's that Kazuo?
This is <avatar_name>. We met recently.\nWe've been practicing together a lot.
I see.
I'm Masao Tachibana, Kazuo's older twin.\nNice to meet ya, <avatar_name>!
So what brings you here today? You came together,\nso are you doing something together?
To surprise you, Masao!
Tell him, Kazuo!
That's right. Watch this!
Alright!
Hang on! Hang on! I will.
Anyway...! Check this out, Masao!
So something you two have been working\non together... Could it be?!
Yes! Yes it could! Here we go!
Unbelievable... You two can do it, too?!
There's nothing unusual about it.\nIf you can do it, I can do it, too!
Hmm. Yeah, makes sense.
Well, let's see it then.
Alright, we'll show you!\nHere goes nothing, <avatar_name>!
Wh-What the?!\nYou pulled off a Twin Shot with someone else?!
When we met before, I had a feeling we could work\nwell together, so I decided to put that theory to\nthe test!
That's awesome.
Well, we're not attending the same school right\nnow, so it doesn't really matter if we can pull\noff a Twin Shot or not.
But if we happen to be chosen as reps,\nthis could be a huge weapon for us!
Tak! You said it! We'll be the Twin Shot Trio!\nThe world will be awestruck!
You're right. We might even get some attention\nin the next International Tournament.
Do your best in the remaining matches,\n<avatar_name>!
Then, we'll all become reps together!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Hoo-rah!
<avatar_name>!\nOur combinations are getting better all the time!
When we met before, I had a feeling that we could\nsync up well, but I had no idea we'd be able to\npull off Twin Shots...
I'm shocked that I can do them\nwith someone other than my brother.
We finally did it!\nOur practice has really paid off!
And yet, I still can't believe I'm able to match\nmy breathing as well with you as I do with my\nbrother...
(If I can align my breathing with him as well as I\ndo with my brother, then I'm sure we can pull off\nour special technique, too!)
Got a minute, <avatar_name>?
I want to practice the Skylab Hurricane!
We'll rule the skies over America!
Not to sound like a broken record...
But we really are in sync!
You... How did you know what I was thinking?!
But I really get the feeling we're ready for it...\nThe Skylab Hurricane!
Based on what I've seen, you've got better lower\nbody strength. My advantage is in jumping power\nand intuition.
That's why you should focus on thoroughly training\nyour lower body so that you can be the launching\npad for the Skylab.
Don't look so disappointed.\nJumping during the Skylab is dangerous.\nDo it wrong, and you'll land flat on your head.
And if the person serving as the launching pad\nis unreliable, the jumper will hesitate, too.
What I'm trying to say is...\nI'm putting my faith in you.
It's really been a shock how strong\nthe rest of the world has proven to be.
The scrims against America and Germany were really\ndiscouraging. Even the Skylab Hurricane proved\nineffective...
But I learned something, as well. And that's that\nnobody else in the world uses aerial techniques\nlike we do!
In other words, if we work hard enough,\nJapan can control the air game during matches!
Let's do our best as reps to make Japan\nthe best in the world, <avatar_name>!
Okay, are you ready, <avatar_name>?
That was perfect!
What do you think, Kazuo?
Great attitude! You're very reliable!
If you can afford to worry about me,\nyou're on the right track!
Alright, I'm counting on you!
Right on! Here we go!
Here goes nothing, <avatar_name>!
We... We did it!
Way to go, Kazuo and <avatar_name>!
Because you and <avatar_name> were able to perform\nthe Skylab Hurricane, I naturally believed that\nwe could do it as well...
That certainly makes sense!
I knew the two of us could do it, <avatar_name>!
I had been practicing with <avatar_name>, too...\nBut it looks like you beat me to the punch.
Alright, now it's our turn!\nLet's give it our all, <avatar_name>!
I never thought I'd meet anyone besides the two\nof us who could pull off the Skylab Hurricane.
You're really something.
Me and my brother. My brother and <avatar_name>.\nAnd me and <avatar_name>.
Now, we can play aerial football\nfrom anywhere on the pitch!
Tak! The skies above the pitch belong to Japan!
We've added another huge weapon\nto Japan's aerial assault!
Tak! The three of us will rule\nthe skies above the pitch!
Let's do this, <avatar_name>!
We're perfect! I bet we could perform Twin Shots\nand Skylab Hurricanes with our eyes closed!
But it's still kind of strange\nif you think about it.
To think that we make such a perfect combo despite\nnever meeting until the beginning of the Junior\nHero League.
To think that we make such a perfect combo despite\nnever playing together before coming here as reps.
I've been with my brother since the day we were\nborn. But I feel a strong connection to you, too.
Heh, it's almost like having a little brother!
The three Tachibana brothers!
I'm counting on you, big Bro!
Three brothers! That has a nice ring to it!
You sometimes hear about twins playing together,\nbut it's rare to hear about triplets!
You called me "big bro"!
I've never been called that before.\nIt feels kinda strange!
Oh yeah! Come hang out with us in Akita\nwhen this tournament is over.
The food is delicious, and you can even ski\nin winter! My brother and I will teach you how!
Thank you!
Don't you have to study for exams?
Tak! Just leave it to your big bro!
Well, yeah. But it's not like\nI'm gonna be studying nonstop.
I can definitely find time to hang out.
But before that, we'll have to\nfight our way through this tournament.
Let's do our best to win the tournament and share\nthe memories later over some nice hot eats up in\nnorthern Japan!
I thought about this in the match earlier,\n<avatar_name>.
The rhythm of your passes matches mine perfectly.
What can I say? It's comforting how\nwe're able to time our passes so well.
I don't really know the reason behind it,\nbut my brother is the only other person with whom\nI've been so in sync.
There might be some sort of connection between us.
I'd love it if we could team up for the\nInternational Tournament, but we'll have\nto do our best to be chosen as reps first.
Alright! Our combination is bound\nto add some energy to the team!
I think this could be combined\nwith more powerful shots.
If Kazuo's right, a more powerful shot should\nmake the Skylab Hurricane all the more effective.
At least, that's what I think. How about you?
It's just like you said.\nIt'll make the Skylab Hurricane even better!
Yeah, so...
Ah, <avatar_name>. Perfect timing!
Remember practicing the Skylab Hurricane together?\nI've been thinking things over since then.
I've been thinking that power isn't the only\nfactor in performing a Skylab Hurricane.\nThat it can be performed with technique as well.
And if that's the case,\nit would make the shot even more effective.
I was thinking of trying it out now.\nHelp me out, <avatar_name>!
The two of us have been using the Skylab Hurricane\nin our attack for a while now.
But if you fire the shot with the same power\nevery time, your opponent gets used to it,\nand it gradually becomes harder to score.
That's why I've been thinking that my brother\nand I could mix it up a bit to make the Skylab\nHurricane more effective than ever before.
With more than one kind of Skylab Hurricane,\nthe defense will have to figure out which\nwe're using to deal with it.
So I'm wondering if I couldn't pull off a\ntechnical shot aimed at the corner of the goal\nthat's hard for the goalkeeper to reach.
Help me practice it, <avatar_name>!
Alright, let's practice while\nresting our legs like before!
I can't work on this without someone to send\npasses my way, so I'm counting on you!
Okay, let's get started!
Gah! I'm still hitting the center of the goal.\nLet's try again!
We're starting to get this thing down,\nbut it's still within reach of the goalkeeper.\nWe need to aim for that corner.
Agh... Kazuo, my leg can't handle much more!
Okay, let's rest a bit.
Alright! We'll get it this time!
Kazuo!
Yeah, you did it! How you used your\nbody just now... It was perfect!
Thanks for helping out, <avatar_name>!
I'll teach you the trick to the\naerial move we've been working on later.
It should be of use to you\neven outside Skylab Hurricane!
Hey, <avatar_name>. When we worked on the\nTwin Shot during practice for the first time...
I felt like I could sense how\nyou were going to move.
You too, Kazuo?!
Yeah, of course.
I see! So it was the same for you!
So you knew it all along?!\nMaybe I'm not as sharp as you then...
Like I said before, it's the same feeling\nI get when I'm playing with my brother.
But it's not like we're brothers or anything.\nWe didn't even know each other until recently.\nI wonder what it could be...
Maybe you're just a good combo.
Misaki!
Tsubasa and I are the same. We first met in\nelementary school, and even our breathing is\nperfectly in sync now.
So, even though we hadn't seen each other in three\nyears, we were able to pick up where we left off.
I don't really understand it, but Tsubasa\nand I are able to communicate without words.\nThat much I know for sure.
You and Kazuo are definitely like me and Tsubasa,\n<avatar_name>.
I still don't understand it,\nbut your words ring true, Misaki.
Alright, <avatar_name>! Let's be as productive\non the field as Tsubasa and Misaki!
Hey, <avatar_name>! Perfect timing!
Let's get some morning practice in!
Where's Masao?
Sure thing!
Oh, he forgot his lunch, so he ran home to get it.
He can be kind of a dingleberry sometimes.
Thanks, man!
I've got a lot to do each morning,\nand it helps to have someone to work with.
I'm starting off with trampoline jumps,\nso I need you to pass the ball up for a header.
It's easier if you use your hands though,\nlike you're playing basketball.
Okay? Okay!
Again!
Phew, thanks.
Skylab Hurricane puts me in the air much higher\nthan a normal jump, so the angle of the header is\nway steeper.
That's why I need this trampoline to practice.
Plus it helps me practice the landing,\nwhich, you know, is kind of important!
Actually, wanna try it out for yourself,\n<avatar_name>?
Can I?
Um... That's a little...
Why not? Let's get you started!
C'mon, don't say that. We'll start you off lower\nto the ground and build up. You'll be fine!
Okay, let's get started!
Whoa, it's gettin' late. Okay, one last time then!
Nice. I knew you had good instincts.
It's not like me or Masao got it right away,\neither. That was pretty impressive!
You might even be able to...
On second thought, forget it.
Whoops! It's that time.\nLooks like everyone else is showing up.
I've got high hopes for you, <avatar_name>!
Okay guys, split into twos!\nWe'll practice going from pass chains to a shot!
Hey, could you do this one with me, <avatar_name>?\nI wanna try something out.
Do you mean...? Can we...?
Try what out?
Looks like we were thinking the same thing.\nI knew you were on the same wavelength.
And have some confidence!\nWe can definitely do this.
Well, you see...
Hanawa MS Practice
Alright, next! Kazuo and <avatar_name>!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Now!
Success!
See, just like I told ya!
I figured if you and Masao could do it,\nthen we definitely could, too!
You did it, you two!
I was sure we'd be able to pull it off together!
That was crazy! You two are awesome!
That'll be another ace up our sleeve for Hanawa!
Hey, you got a moment, <avatar_name>?\nCould you help me out with my training?
I'll be jumping, and I want you to slam into me\nas hard as you can.
What kind of training is this?
This about what happened in Nationals?
You saw what happened at Nationals, right?\nIn the match against Nankatsu, Masao and Tsubasa\nwere going at it in midair.
That was when Tsubasa hurt his shoulder,\ntrying to protect my brother from a bad landing.
Yep. That's the size of it.
That was when Tsubasa hurt his shoulder,\ntrying to protect my brother from a bad landing.
We can't let anyone else get hurt because of us\nlike that.
I need to figure out how we can maintain our\nbalance, even if there's a midair collision.
That's what we're working on here,\nso we can make a safe landing no matter what.
If we can manage that, then next time maybe\nit'll be us protecting other people.
I'm counting on you, <avatar_name>!
Phew... I think that's enough for today.
Thanks for going along with that crazy training.
We're the only ones who play like this, so there\naren't any examples to follow, and it's easy to\nget a bump or a bruise, here and there.
It's one thing if either of US get hurt from\nour own stupidity, but if someone else does,\nwell, that's not okay.
So I've been thinking a lot about how to prevent\nthat.
I mean, we've got a lot of people expecting great\nthings from us back at school.
Which is why we've gotta ride this thing\nall the way to the end, our own way!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Alright!
<avatar_name>!\nOur combinations are getting better all the time!
I felt in sync with you ever since we first\npracticed at school, but I never thought\nwe'd be pulling off Twin Shots!
I'm shocked that I can do them\nwith someone other than my brother.
We finally did it!\nOur practice has really paid off!
And yet, I still can't believe I'm able to match\nmy breathing as well with you as I do with my\nbrother...
(If I can align my breathing with him as well as I\ndo with my brother, then I'm sure we can pull off\nour special technique, too!)
Got a minute, <avatar_name>?
I want to practice the Skylab Hurricane!
We'll rule the skies over America!
Not to sound like a broken record...
But we really are in sync!
You... How did you know what I was thinking?!
But I really get the feeling we're ready for it...\nThe Skylab Hurricane!
Based on what I've seen, you've got better lower\nbody strength. My advantage is in jumping power\nand intuition.
That's why you should focus on thoroughly training\nyour lower body so that you can be the launching\npad for the Skylab.
Don't look so disappointed.\nJumping during the Skylab is dangerous.\nDo it wrong, and you'll land flat on your head.
And if the person serving as the launching pad\nis unreliable, the jumper will hesitate, too.
What I'm trying to say is...\nI'm putting my faith in you.
It's really been a shock how strong\nthe rest of the world has proven to be.
The scrims against America and Germany were really\ndiscouraging. Even the Skylab Hurricane proved\nineffective...
But I learned something, as well. And that's that\nnobody else in the world uses aerial techniques\nlike we do!
In other words, if we work hard enough,\nJapan can control the air game during matches!
Let's do our best as reps to make Japan\nthe best in the world, <avatar_name>!
Okay, are you ready, <avatar_name>?
Never better!
What do you think, Kazuo?
Great attitude! You're very reliable!
If you can afford to worry about me,\nyou're on the right track!
Alright, I'm counting on you!
Tak! Here goes nothin'!
Let's do this, <avatar_name>!
We... We did it!
Way to go, Kazuo and <avatar_name>!
Because you and <avatar_name> were able to perform\nthe Skylab Hurricane, I naturally believed that\nwe could do it as well...
That certainly makes sense!
I knew the two of us could do it, <avatar_name>!
I had been practicing with <avatar_name>, too...\nBut it looks like you beat me to the punch.
Alright, now it's our turn!\nLet's give it our all, <avatar_name>!
I never thought I'd meet anyone besides the two\nof us who could pull off the Skylab Hurricane.
I knew you had good instincts,\never since we met at school, but still...
Me and my brother. My brother and <avatar_name>.\nAnd me and <avatar_name>.
Now, we can play aerial football\nfrom anywhere on the pitch!
Tak! The skies above the pitch belong to Japan!
We've added another huge weapon\nto Japan's aerial assault!
Tak! The three of us will rule\nthe skies above the pitch!
Let's do this, <avatar_name>!
We're perfect! I bet we could perform Twin Shots\nand Skylab Hurricanes with our eyes closed!
But it's still kind of strange\nif you think about it.
We may have gone to the same school,\nbut we hardly played together at all until\nthe Junior Hero League.
But look how perfect we play together now!
It's like having another Masao!
No, wait, you're younger than me...
Heh, it's almost like having a little brother!
The three Tachibana brothers!
I'm counting on you, big Bro!
Three brothers! That has a nice ring to it!
You sometimes hear about twins playing together,\nbut it's rare to hear about triplets!
"Big bro," huh?
I've never been called that before.\nIt feels kinda strange!
Hey, when winter comes and this tournament is long\nover, how about we go skiing together?
We're ace at skiing!
I'm not too bad, either!
Don't you have to study for exams?
Ooh, sounds like a challenge.\nWe'll have to have a little competition.
Well, yeah. But it's not like\nI'm gonna be studying nonstop.
I can definitely find time to hang out.
But before that, we'll have to\nfight our way through this tournament.
Let's do our best to win the tournament and share\nthe memories later over some nice hot eats up in\nnorthern Japan!
You know, <avatar_name>, I've been thinking this\never since we practiced passing at school...
The rhythm of your passes is almost exactly\nthe same as mine.
Not only that, but your timing on sending and\nreceiving... It's scary how similar we are.
I don't really know the reason behind it,\nbut my brother is the only other person with whom\nI've been so in sync.
There might be some sort of connection between us.
I'd love it if we could team up for the\nInternational Tournament, but we'll have\nto do our best to be chosen as reps first.
Alright! Our combination is bound\nto add some energy to the team!
Hey <avatar_name>. Remember, when we did our first\nTwin Shot during practice?
We'd never tried it together before,\nso why was I sure we could pull it off?
That was the first time I had that kinda\nconfidence in someone that wasn't Masao.
Maybe you're just a good combo.
Misaki?
Tsubasa and I are the same. We first met in\nelementary school, and even our breathing is\nperfectly in sync now.
So, even though we hadn't seen each other in three\nyears, we were able to pick up where we left off.
I don't really understand it, but Tsubasa\nand I are able to communicate without words.\nThat much I know for sure.
You and Kazuo are definitely like me and Tsubasa,\n<avatar_name>.
I still don't understand it,\nbut your words ring true, Misaki.
Alright, <avatar_name>! Let's be as productive\non the field as Tsubasa and Misaki!
Hey, <avatar_name>, I know I mentioned practicing\ntogether today...
But y'know I took a cleat to my ankle during\nafternoon practice? Yeah, it's starting to swell,\nso I gotta get home and ice it.
I'm really sorry. Let's take a rain check!
























I know I said we'd practice together today,\n<avatar_name>, but I'm not feeling well...
I'd hate to get any worse,\nso I'd like to rest a bit today. Sorry.
I know I promised that we'd practice together\ntoday, but everyone in my family is sick...
I'm worried about them, so I'm heading home.\nSorry to go back on my promise.
I know I promised that we'd practice together\ntoday, but you see, I forgot about my summer\nhomework...
I want to prioritize that today. Sorry about that!
Sorry, <avatar_name>. I said we could practice\ntogether today, but I hurt my wrist in training\njust now.
I can't afford for it to get any worse,\nso I'm gonna be taking the day off. Sorry!
You...!
Oh, if it isn't <avatar_name>!
Yeah... It's <avatar_name>, isn't it?\nI remember your play from the match earlier!
What are you doing here all by yourself?\nVoluntary practice?
Actually...
Would you practice with me?
I see. So things didn't work out with\nyour practice partner. It happens.
Want to practice with me then?\nI happen to be free at the moment.
Yeah, sure.
I was planning on practicing with my brother,\nbut he twisted his ankle during practice,\nforcing us to cancel our plans.
Let's work on moving and passing. Idziemy!
(Wh-What's this?! This feeling when receiving\nthe ball?! I know it all too well!)
(And our timing is totally on the mark?!)
<avatar_name>, our passes just now...\nDid anything feel unusual about them?
We moved in perfect harmony.
It felt oddly familiar.
This feeling...\nTo be honest, I know it all too well.
I was thinking the same thing.\nAnd I know this feeling all too well.
The feeling I got when we were passing just now is\nvirtually the same feeling I get when I play with\nmy brother.
Even though it's our first time playing together,\nour ability to time our passes this well...\nWhat's going on here?
It is... interesting to say the least.
(If we're working this well together\nafter so little time...\nI'm sure we can do something spectacular!)
Hey, let's practice again sometime\nwhen the opportunity arises!
There's something I want to try with you!
I know I said we'd practice together today,\n<avatar_name>, but I'm not feeling well...
I'd hate to get any worse,\nso I'd like to rest a bit today. Sorry.
I know I promised that we'd practice together\ntoday, but everyone in my family is sick...
I'm worried about them, so I'm heading home.\nSorry to go back on my word.
I know I promised that we'd practice together\ntoday, but you see, I forgot about my summer\nhomework...
I want to prioritize that today. Sorry about that!
I know I said we'd practice together today <avatar_name>,\nbut my knee's a little outta whack.
I'd hate for it to get any worse,\nso I'd like to rest a bit today. Sorry.
You...!
Oh, if it isn't <avatar_name>!
It's <avatar_name>, isn't it?\nI remember seeing you play in the match before!
What are you doing here all by yourself?\nVoluntary practice?
Actually...
Would you practice with me?
I see. Things didn't work out with your practice\npartner. It happens.
Want to practice with me then?\nI happen to be free at the moment.
Yeah, sure.
I was planning on practicing with my brother,\nbut he twisted his ankle during practice,\nforcing us to cancel our plans.

Hey, let's practice again sometime when the\nopportunity arises!
There's something I want to try with you!







Get bent!
Ho-yeah!
Gotcha!
Boom!
Now's the time!
Here's a good 'un!
Power up!























Captain!
All yours!
Counting on you!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
Over here!
Let's work together!
Tsubasa!

Hey, I pulled it off!
Woo! I'm a beast under pressure!
Ha! Piece of cake!
I'm on course to outpace even Tsubasa!
The name's Shun Nitta! Remember it!
I'm climbin' higher every day!
You should see the looks on your faces!
Time to push into the lead!
We're gonna crush 'em!
Gotta score! It can't end like this!
Pass it here! I'll get the job done!
Just take back what's taken, right?
We'll catch up in no time!
Right on!
There we go!
Good show!
That's not good!
You kiddin' me?!
Blow 'em up!
Now, that's a pass!
On fire!
On it!
I'm up!
I'm open!
To me!
Wide open!
Pass it here!
Go in!
Hoo boy!
Choke on this!
Falcon Shot!
Falcon Shot!
The Falcon Shot's talons are out!
It's go time!
This one won't miss!
Gotta make it count!
No-trap running volley Falcon Shot!
Falcon Volley Shot!
Have some dessert!
Pushin' past!
Get off me!
Too slow!
Finally on your level, Tsubasa!
Someday, I'll surpass you, Tsubasa!
I'm the ace, not you Hyuga!
I knew you'd be a challenge, but...
I'm faster, Misaki!
Nankatsu veterans represent!
Falcons are faster than eagles!
Outflown by an eagle...
I'm not holding back, Misugi!
Whoa, that's some skill.
I won't lose, Masao, land or air!
Ugh! I can't believe I lost to Masao!
I won't lose, Kazuo, land or air!
Ugh! Kazuo actually beat me!
Too slow, Jito!
Gah, I shouldn't take Jito head on.
Ace Killer? More like Space Filler!
Ouch! That's the Ace Killer for you.
Too slow, Ishizaki!
What I expected of a Nankatsu veteran.
I won't go easy on you, Urabe!
I knew it! Urabe knows all my moves!
I'll dethrone you, Schneider!
Gah! A world-class ace indeed.
I won't lose to a kid my age, Heine!
Whatever! I'll get you next time, Heine!
You're not the fastest, Pierre!
Gah! Still no match for Pierre...
This match is mine, Napoleon!
I won't lose next time, Napoleon!
You can't handle me, Jean!
Just try that again, Jean!
I'll beat anyone, even you Kluivoort!
Kluivoort... So this is world-class.
Not even you're a match for me, Rusciano!
Gah! Rusciano!
See that, Carlos? I can handle you!
Is this how good they are in Brazil?
I guess "prodigy" doesn't mean much!
Guess I'm no match for Diaz.
Are you even trying, Senghor?
Since when were you this good, Senghor?
You won't see through me that easy Ryan!
Gah! He's just too sharp!
Muscle weighs you down, Blake!
Łoł! I can't fight that!
I'm gonna be number one in Japan!
I'll catch up with you someday!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Heh. You did pretty well last game, <avatar_name>,\nbut looks like your tricks won't work on me.
Okay, <avatar_name>, let's switch passing positions!
I'll go next. Wakabayashi!
You said it!
(<avatar_name>'s position, the speed and angle the\nball comes at...)
Okay, whenever you're ready!
This is it!
Wh-What?!
Alright! It worked!
You're amazing, Nitta!
What... What was that?!
Thanks, man!
Actually, I've been looking into direct shots\nlately, so I thought I'd try out what I learned!
I've been thinking about no-trap, direct shots\nlately.
I've been meaning to try one out in practice for a\nwhile, but it went even better than I had hoped!
Oh? So, what exactly were you thinking about?
Before, I had to concentrate really hard to get\nthe timing of the incoming pass right for a\nfull-power kick.
But lately, I've gotten used to it, so I noticed I\nhad a bit of leeway before the shot.
Changing up the timing or the angle I catch the\nball at even a little can make a pretty big\ndifference in power.
So, I've been subtly changing my kick to better\nmatch the speed and course of the incoming pass.\nAll to make the best possible direct shot.
Oh, so that was it. That shot just now was way\nsharper and faster than usual.
But it's easier said than done. I still don't even\nknow what kind of kick goes best with each pass.
If that's all, I could lend a hand.
Mr. Katagiri!
As a former Japanese Forward myself, I have some\nexperience with that.
Because of my eye I can't demonstrate it for you,\nbut I can try to explain it at least.
For real?! Please!
Got it.\nThen I'll start with the most orthodox shot...
...And that should get you started.
That said, in a real match you'll be under\npressure, and the opponent won't just wait for you\neither, so I can't guarantee it'll go as planned.
Even so, it can't hurt to try.
Thank you so much, Mr. Katagiri!\nI'll start practicing that right away!
Let's ask Takeshi to pass!
Let's ask Soda to pass!
Takeshi, huh?\nHe's got the technique for it, that's for sure.\nHe can throw all sorts of passes my way.
Soda's Razor Pass, huh? That's sure jumping in\nfrom the deep end.
But that just makes it worth doing!
Let's go ask him!
...
You look happy, Mr. Katagiri.
Yeah.
(My life as a player has been over ever since the\ninjury, but nothing makes me happier than knowing\nmy experience is helping the next generation.)
(Is this how Roberto feels about Tsubasa?)
Zróbmy to!
Phew... Not bad.
You...
Oh, if it isn't <avatar_name>!
You're...<avatar_name>, right?\nI'm having a hard time remembering...
Oh yeah... You're, <avatar_name>, right?\nI think I've seen you play somewhere before...
So what're you doin' here?
Please, teach me the Falcon Shot!
Your shots sure are cool!
Oh, so my shot caught your eye?\nYou've got good taste...
But you couldn't possibly do it.\nDon't waste time trying.
Wh-Where did that come from?
Wait, don't tell me you want to learn my shot...
This shot requires my unique combination of leg\npower and instincts. You can't possibly do it.\nGive up now.
I'm warning you. Don't even think of\nwatching me practice to steal my ideas.
Not that simply watching would be enough\nfor you to pull off my techniques!
Anyway, you're interrupting my practice. If you're\ngonna watch, do it from somewhere off to the side.
Oh, if it isn't <avatar_name>!\nWhat're you doin' here?
Huh? My Falcon Shot?
Interesting. Show me what you can do!
N-No way! Seriously?!
Fine. I'll admit that your instincts are on point.
So let's compete one-on-one this time! Here we go!
Ha! You're... not half bad...
Don't doubt me because I'm younger!
You're still the best, Nitta!
Hahaha! Sounds like the same kind of thing\nI used to always say to older opponents!
I see. So this is how the people\nI used to say that to must've felt.
I was such a little brat.
Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I\nalways practice and play with that in mind.
Fine, <avatar_name>. I accept you.\nYou're a lively kid.
(This is really getting me pumped\nfor next year's nationals!)
So let's both do our best and meet again as reps!
Unfortunately, your school and Otomo MS are in\nseparate leagues, so we won't be facing each\nother.
Which means the next time we'd meet...\nwould be representing Japan.
Let's do our best to make sure we're both chosen!
Come on, <avatar_name>!
Łoł! Such blazing speed on the dribble!
You've really been working hard lately,\n<avatar_name>!
I didn't know much about you back in the Junior\nHero League, but you really get things done, huh?
That reminds me, you were practicing\nmy Falcon Shot earlier.
And your dribbling reminds me of my own.\nHave you been studying my technique?
Well, you're energetic for a first-year.\nIt's nice havin' you around!
I remember your play from back when\nyou played Otomo MS, <avatar_name>.
That reminds me, you were practicing\nmy Falcon Shot earlier.
And your dribbling reminds me of my own.\nHave you been studying my technique?
If that's the case, feel free to ask me anything!\nNo need to be shy! I'm happy to help!
Watching your shooting practice earlier, it looks\nlike you've finally got my Falcon Shot down.\nThough it certainly took you long enough...
And now you're copying my dribbling...\nI guess it's nice to have an admirer.
Well, not that I mind! Feel free to ask me\nanything! I'm always here to help out a\nfirst-year!
Back in the Junior Hero League I said we should\nboth aim to get picked, but I'm sure glad it\nactually happened!
So that dribble just now was based on mine, right?\nI knew you had good instincts!
Anyway, don't be shy if you have any questions.\nI'm always happy to help out a first-year!
Anyway, we're not gonna lose to the third-years,\nare we?
Let's show 'em the power of a falcon!
A pleasure to work with you, Nitta!
You know it! We'll be two falcons,\nsoaring over the field!
You can count on me!
Anyway, how about that practice, yeah?\nLet's do this!
You've been working almost as hard as me lately,\n<avatar_name>!
So how about we practice together again, today?
Man... We ran and ran and ran... Training with\nyou really gets the ol' engine humming.
Maybe to everyone else we're just kids...
But we're representing our country, too, right?\nAge shouldn't matter. We won't fall behind!
But actually, something's been\nbothering me lately.
Our team's ace striker has gotta be Hyuga, right?\nNo matter how you spin it, I'm no match for him.
So in order to stand out, I've gotta use what\nI've got: my speed. But I feel like I've hit a\nwall with that these days.
No matter how hard I try, no matter how much I\nrun, my time's aren't really getting any better.
At this rate, I won't have anything\ngoing for me anymore...
Sorry. I know it's weird for me\nto be complaining like this...
Don't worry, your legs are world-class!
Have you considered other methods?
Hah, thanks, man.
World-class, huh? I like the sound of that.
You're saying my approach is the problem?
Maybe you're right... I mean, I'm not improving.
Another method, huh?
Wait... I know!
I owe you one, <avatar_name>!\nI'm starting to see it now!
Alright... Zróbmy to!
You're asking what kind of training I normally do?
Yeah. To be honest...
I see. Yeah, I'm sure Uruguay and Japan use\ndifferent training methods, so maybe there's\nsomething that'll suit you better.
Okay, I'll teach you what I know. But in return,\nyou tell me all about your methods, okay?
You want to know the trick to making full speed\nplays? I usually do it without thinking so it's\nhard to convey in words...
I think you need to just do it over and over\nagain to develop the proper muscle memory.\nThen your instincts will take over.
You've sure got guts coming to ME about this,\nNitta. In a good way, though.
I'm willing to talk about my training methods,\nbut only if you tell me yours, too.
Based on our past battles, I think we can\ndefinitely help each other improve. I respect you.
Thanks, Jean.
I have to do it instinctively? Thanks, Diaz.
<avatar_name>.
I just went around and asked the\nfastest people I know from other teams.
That's what you suggested earlier, right?\nI thought it was a good idea to learn from the\ndifferent training methods used all over world.
And thanks to that, I've heard all kinds of\ninteresting stuff that I can use in my training.
You've put in so much effort, and come so far,\nbut I'm not gonna lose to you!
You can't beat me!
Challenge accepted!
Last time I said age didn't matter,\nbut this time I guess I'm the older one!
Whoa there, getting a little cocky, are we?\nInteresting. But that's what makes it fun!
I'm gonna start training as soon as\nwe get back to the dorms! Come with me!
Let's make sure we stand out,\neven on the All-Japan team!
You've really gotten good at that Falcon Dribble,\nhuh, <avatar_name>?\nIt's practically second nature to you now!
Let's switch it up.\nThis time, try and stop my dribble!
Weren't expecting that, were you?\nI've got another ace up my sleeve.\nI call it the Low Falcon Dribble.
The Falcon Dribble's all about jumping up a little\nwhile sprinting, but this one's more about jumping\nFORWARD.
Make sure you don't lose any momentum when\nyou jump. By maintaining acceleration,\nyou'll slip past 'em before they can react.
I know you can handle it,\nso let's get crackin' already!
You've gotten pretty good at the Falcon Shot,\nhuh, <avatar_name>?
With a kick that sharp,\nmaybe you can handle this one, too...
Of course, I'm talking about Shun Nitta's\nfamous no-trap running volley Falcon Shot!
The name pretty much describes the whole deal,\nbut basically it's a Falcon Volley Shot made\nwithout trapping the ball. And while running.
It's great for when the opponent's practically\nstanding on your heels, and you don't have time\nto trap.
The most important thing you need for this shot is\nto match the timing for taking the shot with your\nsprint.
Not to brag, but it only took me five tries\nto get the timing in a match down.
I wonder how many it'll take you...\nOnly one way to find out!
Łoł! Five tries exactly, the same as me! Not bad!
Okay, next time you're helping me out, instead.\nCan't have the inventor of the shot fall behind,\nnow can we?
...
What are you doing at a time like this, Nitta?
I was thinking about that goal\nfrom our game with France.
Oh, that? Yeah, that was pretty cool.
A full-power kick combined with a\nfull-speed dash... It was an ideal shot.
But it only worked out through sheer luck.\nI wouldn't be able to pull it off again even\nif my life depended on it.
But I want to. If I could,\nI'd be able to move advance as a striker.\nThat's what I was thinking on...
...
All I can say is that if anyone can do it,\nit's you.
Because I know your talent better than anyone.
Urabe...
Racja! I'll give it my best shot!
Phew... It's hard to shoot a perfect shot.\nGo figure.
Guess it's about time to head back.
Hyah!
You'll have to do better than that\nif you want to score on ME!
Darn it! I'll get you this time!
Hmph. Better than last time,\nbut you've still got a long way to go!
This one'll make it for sure!
Wh-What?!
Ha! I did it!
How the...? Each shot was better than the last!
That's what makes Nitta so amazing.
With every shot he misses, he can immediately\nmake adjustments for the next one.
Like his Falcon Volley... He came up with it in\nthe Shizuoka Regional finals with Nankatsu, but he\nwas still fixing the timing right up to the end.
He kept on practicing afterward,\nuntil he finally mastered it mid-match.
Everyone makes mistakes.\nBut only some people grow from them.
You'd better not be scared of makin' mistakes\neither. If it doesn't go well the first time,\nor even the second, keep on trying until it does.
Never give up!
















(Gotta get through this tournament first, though.)
<avatar_name>!\nCan't wait to go head-to-head with you!
I'm... We're gonna win this, so get ready!














I've had my eye on you since the Junior Hero\nLeague, but I gotta say, I didn't think you'd\ncome this far.
Also, that dribble you used was based on mine,\nright? Man, I knew you had good instincts!







Come on, <avatar_name>!
Łoł! Such blazing speed on the dribble!
You've really been working hard lately,\n<avatar_name>!
Hard at work, huh <avatar_name>?
I didn't know much about you back in the Junior\nHero League, but you really get things done, huh?
That reminds me, you were practicing my Falcon\nShot earlier.
And your dribbling reminds me of my own.\nHave you been studying my technique?
Well, you're energetic for a first-year.\nIt's nice havin' you around!
I remember your play from back when\nyou were up against us, <avatar_name>.
That reminds me, you were practicing my Falcon\nShot earlier.
And your dribbling reminds me of my own.\nHave you been studying my technique?
If that's the case, feel free to ask me anything!\nNo need to be shy! I'm happy to help!
You were copying my dribbling just now, weren't\nyou? That shot you were practicing was like my\nFalcon Shot, too.
We were in the same school.\nI would've helped you if you'd just asked.
That said, it looks like you're trying to figure\nit out on your own. Gotta admit, I admire the\nhustle!
Watching your shooting practice earlier, it looks\nlike you've finally got my Falcon Shot down.\nThough it certainly took you long enough...
And now you're copying my dribbling...\nI guess it's nice to have an admirer.
Well, not that I mind! Feel free to ask me\nanything! I'm always here to help out a\nfirst-year!
You're really darn good, <avatar_name>.
Based on that shot earlier, I'd say you're trying\nto copy my Falcon Shot. And that dribbling just\nnow looks pretty familiar, too.
Have you been studying my technique?
Well, we're in the same school,\nso don't hesitate to ask me about anything!\nI'm always here to help out a first-year!
Back in the Junior Hero League I said we should\nboth aim to get picked, but I'm sure glad it\nactually happened!
So that dribble just now was based on mine, right?\nI knew you had good instincts!
Anyway, don't be shy if you have any questions.\nI'm always happy to help out a first-year!
That was my dribble just now, wasn't it? Not bad.
But, man, copying my Falcon Shot AND my\ndribbling... I guess it's nice to have an admirer.
I mean, as an upperclassman, I don't hate it.
Don't be afraid to come to me.\nIf you've got questions, send 'em my way.
C'mon, we're not gonna lose to the third-years,\nare we?
Let's show 'em the power of a falcon!
A pleasure to work with you, Nitta!
You know it! We'll be two falcons,\nsoaring over the field!
You can count on me!
Anyway, how about that practice, yeah?\nLet's do this!
Alright! Lookin' good. If I keep this up,\nOtomo will clean up come game time.
Oh, hey, <avatar_name>.\nYou been watching this whole time?
You might as well be practicing\nif you're just gonna be spacing out.\nDon't tell me you're already worn out.
I was studying　your Falcon Shot.
Just taking your　Falcon Shot for myself.
Oh? You saying you improve just by watching?
I think you're better off actually practicing\nif your plan is to master the Falcon Shot,\nbut that's just me.
Heh. Oh, were you, now? My Falcon Shot's not so\nsimple you'll master it just through observation.
What's with that face? Oh, alright.
C'mere. I'll give you some pointers.
After all, if your shots improve,\nit helps the whole team out.
Huh. You're quicker on the uptake\nthan I gave you credit for.
Guess your display on the field\nthe other day wasn't just a fluke.
You've still got a good ways to go before\nyou can handle my Falcon Shot, though.
Whether you polish it properly comes\ndown to your commitment and hard work.
I'll be looking forward to seeing how far you go.\nDon't let me down, eh?
Okay. Next, let's run through the pattern\nsetting <avatar_name> up for a shot.
Nitta, the last pass is yours.
You got it!
Nitta, go!
Yep!
<avatar_name>! Take the shot!
What?! Just now, was that...?!
<avatar_name> has a shot like that\nin his back pocket?!
Whoa. For real? That shot was exactly like\nNitta's. Did you teach him how to do it?
Yeah, uh...\nI pointed him in the right direction, I guess?
But I seriously didn't think he'd be\nable to use it in this short a time.
Looks like I gotta up my game.\nAt this rate, never mind surpassing Tsubasa,\nI'll get overtaken by this guy.
But you know what? With you two, we can absolutely\ntake Nationals. This is gonna be good.
Was that a good\nshot or what?
Guess this makes me　an ace striker!
Well, duh. I taught it to you, after all.
It's not quite there yet, but it was pretty good.\nThat's all I'll say.
Haha! The nerve of this kid.
That was a good shot, for sure, but\nyou've not quite caught up to me yet.
Can't hate on that attitude, though. I didn't\nget this far without puffing out my chest here\nand there.
You keep improving and next year Otomo\nwill have a new pillar to lean on.
Heck, maybe even sooner... Maybe this tournament.
It'd be great if we can lead Otomo to a sweeping\nvictory, and then we can work toward representing\nJapan.
Let's both do our best! Okay, back to practice!
During this tournament, it's become even clearer\njust how amazing Nitta's tenacity for scoring is.
You have to keep shooting without backing down, no\nmatter how many times you get denied.
It also feels like his shots are getting more\npowerful every time.
Thanks.
As a striker, the ideal is for every shot to score,\nbut that's not how things go.
But if you use the frustration of getting your\nshots blocked as fuel to keep shooting, you'll\nscore eventually.
That's what being a striker means to me.
You listening, <avatar_name>? I want you to take\nNitta's attitude to heart.
Soccer's a sport about scoring points. You can't\nbe afraid of a shot getting blocked or get\ndepressed whenever it happens.
<avatar_name>, let's keep crushing our opponents in a\nhail of shots.
And then win the national championship next year!







How d'ya like this!

Are ya even tryin'?
Ain't no fun fightin' wimps!
We're winnin' this thing!
Hmph. Just warmin' up.
Let's rain on their parade!
Boring! Winnin' shouldn't be this easy.
Keep it up! Charge! Charge! Charge!
Heh. Gettin' interestin' now.
We're takin' back what's been taken!
Bigger they are, harder they fall!
Good goin'!
That's what I like!
Attaboy!
Aw, man...!
What the...?!
Break 'em to bits!
Preciated!
Good to go!
M'all over it!
Here I go!
I'm open!
Send it here!
I know ya see me!
Give it!
Time to show 'em our strength!
Brace yerselves!
Just a little effort!
Suck on this!
You're dead!
Graaah!
Full steam ahead!
Alright, Tachibana!
Let's put it all together!
We make a nice duo, don'cha think?
Hmph. Guess yer nothin' special.
That's what makes ya worth fightin'!
Ha! Not even Hyuga's a match for me!
Yer just makin' this more fun, Hyuga!
Yer tricks won't work, Misaki!
Ya ain't half bad, Misaki!
Where's yer guts, Matsuyama!
I like yer spunk, Matsuyama!
Yer gettin' rusty, Misugi!
You're a fun fight, Misugi!
Gahaha! You can't beat me, Masao!
So which is it?! Masao or Kazuo?!
Gahaha! No way, Kazuo!
Hmph. Sano's better'n you, Nitta.
How'm I gonna look Sano in the eye...
No Ace Killer's gonna kill me!
Yer funner 'n I expected, Soda!
Gahaha! Ya got guts, Ishizaki!
I like yer guts, Ishizaki!
You ain't gonna overpower ME, Takasugi!
When'd you get so good, Takasugi?
Try again in a couple years, kid!
Ugh... Attaboy, Sano!
Power is everythin', Schneider!
Gonna be sweet when I beat ya!
Magician?! Ha! I'll make ya disappear!
Not bad. Same age as Sano, huh?
Hmph. You ain't even makin' it fun.
Gonna be fun smashin' yer fancy plays!
Ain't no shield that can't be smashed!
Ugh. You ain't bad, Jean.
Ha! That all, Kluivoort?!
Gonna be fun crushin' you, Kluivoort!
Hmph. Boring...
Ngh! You pickin' a fight, Rusciano?!
You ain't nothin' special, Carlos.
Carlos, huh? This'll be fun.
What's a shrimp like you gonna do?
Quit wigglin' so much, shrimp!
Skill only takes ya so far, Senghor.
Yer better'n I thought, Senghor!
Stay off the field, squirt!
Th-This squirt's got some moves!
Ga ha ha! That was fun, Blake!
Yer makin' this worth it, Blake!
Hmph. Ain't anyone stronger than me?
Hiroshi Jito's 'bout to ruin yer day!
My hobby's killin' giants.
That's right! Run on home to mommy!
Ah, refreshin'...
Takasugi is the victor!
Alright!
Ugh... We're too different physically.\nHow do I compete with that?
Looks like I'm up! Here goes nothing!
Yo, what're you doing?
Sumo wrestling.
Ishizaki and Urabe were doing it,\nso they let me and Morisaki jump in.
Why didn't you tell me? That sounds awesome!
Yeah, that looks fun. Let me give it a shot.
I'll show you the hidden power of being short!\nYou in, <avatar_name>?
This is great!\nIf we get eight people, we can do a tournament!
I'll be the ref then.
Coach?!
It's my responsibility to make sure you kids\ndon't knock each other's teeth out.
That's the only rule for this, okay?\nTry not to hurt each other.\nIt's important to have fun once in a while.
Let's make a bracket!
Victory goes to Sano!
Too slow, Morisaki!
Shoot... He ran circles around me.
<avatar_name> and Jito are next.
I hope you're ready for some pain, <avatar_name>!
Face each other... Begin!
Blast him head on!
Get around him! Maneuver!
Ya ain't ready for this!
A mosquito'd do more damage!
Right there!
Jito wins!
You don't got what it takes to beat me!
Heh! Of course, he just steamrolled 'im.
(I'm up against Jito next.\nNot sure I'm looking forward to it...)
Takasugi is the victor!
Ow, ow, ow... Not bad.
So it all comes down to Takasugi and Jito...
It's a fitting matchup.
This'll be something to see.
I'm one of the Towering Duo! I won't go down easy!
You know I don't hold back.\nLet's have a good fight!
You may've beat me in middle school nationals,\nbut today is a new day!
I'll let'cha know if you're still as much of a\ndisappointment... after I destroy you!
Bring it on!
You got it!
Well! You do put up a good fight.\nI expected as much.
Urgh... He won't budge!
But I got your number!
Jito is the winner!
Raw strength, I got plenty!
Phew... Jito's a beast.
That settles it! Team champ right here!
A solid stance and unstoppable power is you\nall day, Jito.
I don't need praise. Winning is just what I do.
Huh? What is it, <avatar_name>?\nWant an autograph?
How do I get that kind of power?
How do I get as good at sumo as you?
Hmm... Well, ya gotta start with the right diet!\nOne with all the protein!
But I bet you were hopin'\nI'd say somethin' different.
Hey, you're not thinking of quitting soccer to be\na sumo wrester, are you?
Hey, it's natural the kid idolizes me.\nHe's a guy. Guys wanna get strong.
Now, the trick is ya can't make rash movements.
If you flail around like a whiny baby, you'll mess\nup your center of gravity and lose your footing.
If you plant your feet and lower your center,\nyou can put more oomph behind whatever ya do.
When the guy you're up against circles the ring,\nyou get a good chance to watch 'im move.
Then you wait for the right moment and BAM!\nBlast 'im off his feet with all that power!
That makes a lot of sense.\nIt actually reminds me of how you play soccer.
Not a bad way to think about it.\nIt's important to play to your strengths.
I'm honored you'd say so, Coach.
Don't forget though that sumo takes place in a\nsmall ring. Those strategies won't work on a broad\nsoccer pitch.
Even if you hunker down and try to push off,\nit won't do any good if the other team is\nconstantly outrunning you.
I-I know that!
<avatar_name>, if you're going to learn from Jito,\nbe sure to consider all aspects of his technique,\nincluding the faults.
Coach is right. A strong man knows not to rely\nonly on brute strength.
A truly strong man knows his soft targets,\nas well as what he's good at.
Don't fall into that trap, <avatar_name>!\nYa can't let'chur own strength get the best of ya.
Don't tell me... <avatar_name>, right?
I've had my eye on you since our match.\nI like guys like you.
You didn't stand out much before,\nbut you've gotten pretty slick.
I came ta peek at the rookie folks've been talkin'\nabout, and I have to say I like what I'm seein'.
Still, ya ain't exactly All-Japan material,\nta be frank. So good luck with that.
Still, ya ain't exactly rival material,\nif I'm bein' honest. So good luck with that.
You, too!
Right, I'll do my best!
The heck...? You givin' me lip?!
Hah hah hah! I love it! The nerve of this kid!
Tch! Lemme give ya a tip, kid. You'll never make\nit in soccer if ya ain't got the will to fight me.
Anyway, see ya later. Or not. Who knows?
Łoł!
Łoł!
Łoł!
Well now! That looked like one o' my moves!\nWhen'd ya have the time to nick that?
But guess I was right about ya!\nYou'll go far, <avatar_name>!
With moves like that,\nwe might even both get picked as reps!
With moves like that,\nya might even put up a good fight!
You do your best, too, Jito!
That's what I'm hoping!
Well now! That a challenge?\nGuess you're a man after all!
I'm likin' you more and more!\nA real man's always ready for a fight!
A real teacher's pet type, huh?
Listen here, <avatar_name>, if you're a man\nyou've gotta have some fight in ya!
Anyway, here's hopin' that next time\nwe meet we're both reppin' Japan.
Anyway, here's hopin' we meet again someday!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Łoł! When'd you get so strong?!
Been workin' real hard lately, huh <avatar_name>?
I'm gonna be straight with ya, back in the\nJunior Hero League ya weren't worth spit.\nBut look at ya now. A real man.
And yer even usin' my moves! Ya got a good eye!
I had my eye on ya after our match,\nand look at ya now! A real man.
And yer even usin' my moves! You know what's up!
I knew you were good, and look at ya now!\nA real man.
And yer even usin' my moves! You know what's up!
You've really grown into that defense just now.\nNot bad.
Ya got that glint in your eye. You've really\ngot some fight in ya now. And I like it!
Anyway, if we're gonna be the best in the world,\nwe can't slack off now! Japan's countin' on us!
I'm comin' for ya, Jito!
Why in the world would we slack off?
That's what I wanna hear! Just cuz\nwe're teammates don't mean we can't compete!\nThat's how ya build real muscle!
Hah hah, got me there!
But yer exactly right! Givin' it yer all no\nmatter what is how ya get hair on your chest!
Speaking of, we'd better get to practicin', yeah?
Sorry about callin' ya out at a time like this,\n<avatar_name>.
Could ya bring yer uniform and come with me?
I've got a favor to ask ya.
Could ya take a shot straight at me\nfrom point blank, as hard as ya can?
Wh-Why?
Got it.
I'll explain after. C'mon!
I'll explain after.
Gimme yer best shot!
We're not done yet, keep 'em comin'!
*pant* *pant*
Isn't it about time you explained?
Is that enough, Jito?
Fine... Not like it's a big secret.
Yeah... that's enough.
Okay, here's the thing...
Actually... I had a nightmare.\nAbout that scrim between America and Germany.
Ever since I was a kid I've hated fightin' with\nkids weaker'n me. So I make sure I pick fights\nwith the big, tough guys.
Even back in elementary no one was a match for me.\nSo I fought with middle schoolers. And I won.
So those two matches really\nknocked the wind outta me.
I mean, seein' those guys who beat us get creamed\nlike that... It wasn't even close. I still can't\nbelieve it. Made me wanna call it quits...
But even after all that, you and\nTakeshi cheered us all up. You guys were strong.\nAnd I let myself be weak...
After that, I promised myself\nnever to be so pathetic again.
So here I am. Tryin' to hype myself\nup by takin' your shots.
Sorry again, for askin' ya to do this so late.
But I'm good now.\nI feel m'frustration turnin' into fuel!
After takin' all those shots from ya,\nI got to thinking.
Yer a real beast, man!
Eat this! Neo Tiger Shot!
Raaah!
Wh-What?!
Just what I've been waitin' fer!
It just ain't me if I ain't slayin' giants.
C'mon, Hyuga! Keep 'em comin'!\nI'll block every last one of 'em!
You're on. You want a pounding...\nI'll give you one!
Yo <avatar_name>. I owe ya for last time.
Looks like you're feeling better.
You're really into it today!
You know it! I'm back and better 'n ever!
Yup! I'm back in business!
Back before I got picked, I was really lookin'\nforward to takin' on the best in the world.
But once we got here,\nand I got teammates like Tsubasa and Hyuga...\nSomewhere along the way I got too cocky.
I thought we were hot stuff,\nbut we couldn't cut it here. And that shook me.
But not anymore!
Just you wait, world! I'll show you that\nI'm the... no, WE'RE the strongest!
Guess you were even manlier than I thought,\n<avatar_name>.
Time to take on the world together!
That was some dribble you pulled off last match,\n<avatar_name>.
But it coulda been better. More savage.
Luckily, you got the talent for it\nand me here to teach ya.
The trick is to go in strong. I'm talkin' dump\ntruck strong. Like, flatten anyone gets in yer\nway. Like this!
I mean, where's the fun in just slippin' past 'em?\nIf yer gonna do it, do it hard.\nPut the fear of god in 'em.
You wanna know how we play at Hirado MS?
It's kinda a school secret,\nbut how could I turn ya down?
Okay, listen up.
Back at Nationals they called us a dark horse,\nbut that's just cuz we kept on beating guys\nthey thought were better.
So do that! Beat down the guys they think are\nbetter'n you! Especially their heroes. How're\nthey gonna win without their best guys, huh?
Well, maybe I'm the only one who thinks like that.\nBut if you can drill that into everyone's heads\nuntil they all follow suit... great!
Then your team'd have nothin' to fear!\nThey would BE fear!
But just so ya know, don't even think of tryin'\nto pull this on Hirado. It'll never work.
Sano likes to clown around, but deep down he's way\nbetter'n ya think. His spirit'd never lose to\nyours.
But rest assured any clash you guys\nhave is gonna be a ball.
Maybe I should be training up Sano\nto beat ya while I'm at it!
Your defense caught my eye, <avatar_name>.
Figured I could help ya beef it up today.\nC'mon, let's go!
I brought a ball stuffed with sand,\nand I'm gonna be chucking it at your belly.\nSo you'd better flex those abs!
Once you can take this without flinchin', you'll\nhave the muscles and posture to take on any shot!
Here we go!
You call that a block?! That was a friendly kick!\nUse those guts of yours! I mean, literally!
Now yer gettin' it! Use your strength like that!
One more for the road!
Eat this!
There ya go! Perfect!
Okay, <avatar_name>! Use that Power Block and\nbecome a fortress! Nothing's gettin' past you!
(<avatar_name>'s defense ain't half bad,\nbut it's missing somethin'...)
(It's like... he's tryin' to play it cool.)
(That ain't how it goes. I gotta step in somehow.)
(I got it!)
Hey, <avatar_name>! We're headin' to the field!\nLet's beef up your defense!
What's the matter?! You can't stop me\nwith a fancy pants tackle like that!
Is that all you've got?\nSince when were ya such a wuss?!
I'm embarrassed to be on the same team as ya!\nPack yer bags and go home already, loser!
I'm... a Japanese rep!
I'm... not a loser!
(Yeah! That's what I'm talkin' about!)
Okay, one more time!
(Yeah! That's what I'm talkin' about!)
Okay, one more time!
That's more like it!
Soccer is war. It you don't wanna lose,\nya gotta break the other guy's spirit.
What ya needed was to get down and dirty,\nto be ready to seriously plow through 'em!
With your strength and that spirit, they'll be\nlosing more'n the ball when you're done with 'em!
Łoł!
Łoł!
Łoł!
What the...?! How could I be overpowered?
Well now! That looked like one o' my moves!\nWhen'd ya have the time to nick that?
But guess I was right about ya!\nYou'll go far, <avatar_name>!
With moves like that,\nwe might even both get picked as reps!
With moves like that,\nya might even put up a good fight!
You do your best, too, Jito!
That's what I'm hoping!
Well now! That a challenge?\nGuess you're a man after all!
I'm likin' you more and more!\nA real man's always ready for a fight!
A real teacher's pet type, huh?
Listen here, <avatar_name>, if you're a man\nyou've gotta have some fight in ya!
Anyway, here's hopin' that next time\nwe meet we're both reppin' Japan.
Anyway, here's hopin' we meet again someday!
What are ya doin' practicin' off on your own like\nthat, <avatar_name>?
If being a first year here has you intimidated,\nyou needn't worry.
It's break time, isn't it? Might as well do it\nsmack dab in the middle of the grounds.
Yeah, there ya go! Lemme join ya.\nThat way you can train all comfy like.
Alright, <avatar_name>, give it to me like always!\nHit me with your best shot!
Whoops. May've overdone it with that one.\nYou okay there, buddy?
(The way his eyes glint when he's in the thick of\nit, though...)
(I've thrown down with a ton of dudes in my time,\nbut the ones with that look in their eyes are\nrare.)
You wanna keep goin'? That's the way!
Guess I'll have to go all out, too.\nWouldn't be doin' right by ya otherwise.
Let's do this, then! Come at me!
On second thought, if we keep this up, we might\nrun ourselves out by the time we reach the end\nof regular practice.
Pushin' yourself is good and all,\nbut ya gotta be careful with your body, too.
You're right. Thanks, Captain!
You know this was your idea, right?
Good answer! Ya grow faster if you listen to those\ntryin' to teach ya somethin'.
Yeah, yeah... I know!
Sorry 'bout that. It's hard for me to hold back.
But ya showed the fighter in ya. That's what\nI wanna see durin' the next practice and in the\nmatches that follow!
Captain gave you the run around, eh, <avatar_name>?
But you know, he doesn't go through the trouble of\ntraining just anyone. He sees something in you.
We're countin' on you, too,\nso keep up the hard work!
*pant* *pant*
Hey, <avatar_name>. I thought you'd already gone\nback. What are ya up to?
Me? Trainin', as you can see.
I've gotta buff up enough to withstand the Drive\nShots Tsubasa got me with during Nationals.
That shot got me good.\nMore so than any punch or kick I've ever felt.
So, when I think about that shot and facin' him\nagain, my body starts talkin' to me...
"Don't lose again. Train to win."
Plus, we gotta face Toho's Hyuga in this\ntournament. In other words, there'll be\nTiger Shots to deal with.
You can never be too ready when you're up against\na powerful opponent. I learned that lesson the\nhard way with Tsubasa Ozora at Nationals.
Like I said, I gotta battle that Tiger Shot in our\nnext match with Toho.
I had you guys help me train, but when it comes to\nfightin' head on, no amount of trainin' is ever\nreally enough.
Now that I've beaten Hyuga, my sights are set on\nthe one and only Tsubasa Ozora.
I've lost to him once before,\nand I ain't about to do that again.\nThis time, I'm pullin' out all the stops!
But anyway, that's my business.\nYou go on ahead and rest. Don't mind me.
Our team winning is my business, too.
Time for payback... I mean, help.\nLet me help!
Ya don't say. Got some decent teammates, I do.
Help me train a bit, then.
What was that? I thought I heard you say somethin'\nthat I know you wouldn't dare...
Ah, whatever.\nIf ya say you'll help, I won't turn ya down.
Alright, let's get movin'!
Phew. Not bad.
Thanks, <avatar_name>.\nTrainin' wouldn't have been as good without ya.
Not quite like playing Tsubasa or Hyuga, but your\nshot packed some serious punch for a first year.
Those kicks of yours give me high hopes for\nHirado's future.
With you bein' as strong as you are, there's no\nreason we shouldn't win the whole tournament.
And if you make a good impression, you might end\nup wearing the rep uniform with the rest of us.
This made my abs hurt more than that time I was\npracticin' blocking the Tiger Shot and everyone\nwas havin' a grand ol' time shootin' at me.
When we had our first match, it was easy to suss\nout we had some fresh blood worth a darn.
<avatar_name>, I'm countin' on you for this\nlast match.
Who knows? Maybe after the tournament you'll end\nup wearin' the rep uniform with the rest of us.
That sound far-fetched? Not to me.\nYou've got grit.
Anyway, keep it up. See ya tomorrow!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Łoł! When'd you get so strong?!
<avatar_name>! Working hard as usual!
To be honest, though I was glad, I was also a\nlittle nervous about you when you were chosen\nto rep Japan with me.
But I see I had nothin' to worry about.
No surprise coming from our first-year ace! Haha!
Anyway, if we're gonna be the best in the world,\nwe can't slack off now! Japan's countin' on us!
I'm comin' for ya, Jito!
Of course, we're not slowing down!
That's what I wanna hear! Just cuz we're teammates\ndoesn't mean we can't compete!\nThat's how ya build real muscle!
Hah hah, got me there!
But yer exactly right! Givin' it yer all no\nmatter what puts hair on your chest!
Speaking of, we'd better get to practicin', yeah?
Sorry about callin' ya out at a time like this,\n<avatar_name>.
Could ya bring yer uniform and come with me?
Ya remember the trainin' we did that one time\nwhen everyone took shots at me?
Let's give that another go. But this time, take a\nshot straight at me point blank as hard as ya can.
What...? Now?
...Okay, I guess.
I'm sorry to bug ya, I am.
But please, just do this for me.\nI'll explain later.
Sorry. I'll explain after.
Gimme yer best shot!
We're not done yet, keep 'em comin'!
*pant* *pant*
Isn't it about time you told me\nwhat's up?
Is that enough, Jito?
Fine... Not like it's a big secret.
Yeah... that's enough.
Okay, here's the thing...
Actually... I had a nightmare.\nAbout that scrim between America and Germany.
Ever since I was a kid I've hated fightin' with\nkids weaker'n me. So I make sure I pick fights\nwith the big, tough guys.
Even back in elementary no one was a match for me.\nSo I fought with middle schoolers. And I won.
So those two matches really knocked the wind\noutta me.
I mean, seein' those guys who beat us get creamed\nlike that... It wasn't even close. I still can't\nbelieve it. Made me wanna call it quits...
But even after all that, you and\nTakeshi cheered us all up. You guys were strong.\nAnd I let myself be weak...
After that, I promised myself never to be so\npathetic again.
So here I am... Getting my head back in it by\ntakin' a few of your shots to the bread basket.
Sorry again, for askin' ya to do this so late\n<avatar_name>
But I'm good now.\nI feel m'frustration turnin' into fuel!
After chowing down on a few of your shots,\nit confirmed what I knew about you.
Yer a real beast, man!
Eat this! Neo Tiger Shot!
Raaah!
Wh-What the...?!
Just what I've been waitin' for!
It just ain't me if I ain't slayin' giants.
C'mon, Hyuga! Keep 'em comin'!\nI'll block every last one of 'em!
You're on. You want a pounding...\nI'll give you one!
Yo, <avatar_name>! I owe ya for last time.
Looks like you're feeling better.
You're really into it today!
You know it! I'm back and better 'n ever!
Nothin' to it!
Turns out beating Toho Academy and Nankatsu in\nsuccession in the Junior Hero League gave me the\nwrong idea.
Being the strongest in Japan, I thought I could\ncut it against the rest of the world...
What's more, I found myself with strong\nteammates like Tsubasa and Hyuga...\nBut I got too sure of myself.
I thought we were hot stuff,\nbut we couldn't cut it here. And that shook me.
But we're not repeating that mistake!
Just you wait, world! I'll show you that\nI'm the... that WE'RE the strongest!
Guess you're made of even tougher stuff\nthan I thought, <avatar_name>.
Time to take on the world together!
What's goin' on, <avatar_name>?
Oh... You're comin' to me as the Hirado captain\nand not as an All-Japan member...
Ya wanna know about Hirado's strategies, huh?
Oh... Ya wanna know how Hirado played in my day?
I've already tried to drill it into that\nhead o' yours, but maybe I need to explain it.
Okay, no problem. Listen up.
Back at Nationals they called us a dark horse,\nbut that's just cuz we kept on beating guys\nthey thought were better.
So do that! Beat down the guys they think are\nbetter'n you! Especially, their heroes. How're\nthey gonna win without their best guys, huh?
Well, maybe I'm the only one who thinks like this.\nBut I prefer to drill lessons into everyone's\nheads until everyone's on board.
I'm sure ya remember that all too well.
But that's why the players at Hirado MS play the\nway they do and should be sittin' pretty next year\nand on down the road.
Since we showed our strength at Nationals, we'll\nprobably lose the dark horse moniker, but we'll\nnever lose our drive to beat the best!
Since we beat everyone in the Junior Hero League,\nwe'll probably lose the dark horse moniker, but\nwe'll never lose our drive to beat the best!
But it makes me happy to see ya keepin' the\ntraditions of previous players alive.
Just do your best to stay ahead of the game\nnext year like we did this year.\nYou'll be number one in Japan before long.
You're quite the player, <avatar_name>!\nI had no idea!
I think you're ready to practice a new move\nI came up with...
Don't worry! I got your back!
(Seems like we've fast become training partners.)
I gotta lotta power to disrupt opponents'\nplay with tackles and charges.
And I came up with a new approach while tryin'\nto figure out how to disrupt them further.
Oh? Care to share?
It's what ya'd call a counter.
A counter? Like in fighting?
A counter? Like in soccer?
Of course.
Nah, nah. A counter like in fighting.
If the opponent tries to break into my lane,\nI charge or tackle in a way that syncs to his\nmovements.
This allows me to go deeper with the tackle\nor charge, meanin' a stronger impact overall.
I see. It really is a counter.
Hmm... But these counters seem kinda risky.
Yep.
Matching the opponent's movements perfectly leaves\nya unable to deal with anythin' else.
If you misjudge his movements,\nhe'll have no problem dodgin' ya.
So basically, you need to be able to read your\nopponent's movements and have the skill to align\nyour movements with theirs.
Right ya are.
And to do both those things, ya got no choice but\nto put in the time and effort.
And that's why we need someone like <avatar_name>,\nwho has the stamina and heart to push through my\ntraining and deliver on the field!
<avatar_name>, we'll all do our best to get better!
Łoł!
Łoł!
Łoł!
Łoł!
Well now! That looked like one o' my moves!\nWhen'd ya have the time to nick that?
But guess I was right about ya!\nYou'll go far, <avatar_name>!
With moves like that,\nwe might even both get picked as reps!
With moves like that,\nya might even put up a good fight!
You do your best, too, Jito!
That's what I'm hoping!
Well now! That a challenge?\nGuess you're a man after all!
I'm likin' you more and more!\nA real man's always ready for a fight!
A real teacher's pet type, huh?
Listen here, <avatar_name>, if you're a man\nyou've gotta have some fight in ya!
Anyway, here's hopin' that next time\nwe meet we're both reppin' Japan.
Anyway, here's hopin' we meet again someday!
Łoł!

You ain't got a chance!
You have nothin' on me!
Alright! Just don't lose any more!
Watch for your opportunities!
We're still in this, guys!
Relax, I'll bring us back up!
Don't get sloppy!
We ain't givin' up!
That's what I like to see!

That'll do!
Oh crud.
What the...?!
Don't let 'em beat you!
Now, that's a pass!

You'll never stop this!

Razor Shot!
Razor Shot slicing through!
Razor Pass!
This'll work!
Razor Tackle!
Not so fast!
Not today, Tsubasa!
I'll chase you to the ends of the Earth!
Ha! I'm the Ace Killer, Hyuga!
Didn't even flinch, huh?
I expected more from Tsubasa's partner!
I lost to you?! Why you little...!
You'll need more than guts to beat me!
I can be just as stubborn as you!
How'd you like the Ace Killer, Misugi?!
Ugh! This ain't happenin'!
Heh, you can't take me on alone, Masao!
Did Masao just take me down solo?!
Heh, you can't take me on alone, Kazuo!
Did Kazuo just beat me on his own?!
I'd never live it down if you beat me!
Why can't I beat you?!
Quit slackin' off, Jito!
Ugh. Ya move better than ya look, Jito!
Like I'd lose to you, Ishizaki!
Seriously?! Ishizaki...?
Not on my watch, Schneider!
Ugh! So this is a world-class ace...
Don't get fulla yourself, Heine!
He'll be braggin' about this for weeks.
You ain't gonna beat me that easy!
Ugh! I'd rather deal with Napoleon!
Welcome to Waterloo!
Darn it! I'll get'cha next time!
There's only one Ace Killer, Jean!
Tch! So this is how that feels!
Sorry to dash off, Kluivoort!
Oh man, Kluivoort's got some moves.
I'm disappointed, Rusciano!
Y'wanna fight, Rusciano?!
I'll take you on anytime, Carlos.
Gah! Figures Carlos'd be good.
I'll pin ya down, prodigy or not!
Well, they do call you a prodigy...
Shaking in your cleats, Senghor?
Łoł! Not half bad, Senghor.
I know your moves, Ryan!
Gah! So you researched me, too?
Meatheads just make it easier, Blake!
When all you've got is a hammer, huh?
Too soon to celebrate, punks!
I'll chase ya to the ends of the Earth!
Why you always gotta be wastin' time?
Relax, my Razor Shot's got two blades!
Ack, got me again!
Keep trying! Nothing's getting past me today!
Soda! You've left an opening!
Oof!
(Tsubasa isn't done training his stance yet.\nThis is my chance to stand out!)
Sorry, guys.
Soda had me locked down during that practice\nmatch. I couldn't make a single opening.
Don't worry about it. Everyone has their off days.
It's not an off day... Soda was just solid.
Well, my job was to keep you marked.
The way you kept him basically outta the game,\nthough! You really are the Ace Killer!
I didn't see the match in Japan,\nbut I heard all about it.
I didn't expect to be stuck for the whole match.\nYou're an even better defender,\nthan you were back in Japan.
I have to sharpen my skills to play\nat the international level!
If I can hold you,\nI think my defense might be world-class.
If I were playing with teams from all over the\nworld, like today I wouldn't give my mark any\nroom to work with.
We'll need that from you.
But Soda, after you got the ball from Tsubasa,\nyou seemed to be dragging your feet a bit.
Yeah... You're right about that.
When I'm up against a player like Tsubasa,\nall my focus is on the moment for a tackle,\nand I overcommit to guarantee it works.
But if I focus too hard on the tackle,\nI make myself vulnerable. It creates an opening.
So that's what happened.
But if you get yourself in a pinch,\nwhat's the point?
Don't be stupid! It wouldn't work at all\nif I wimped out.
Besides, you hafta swap straight to attack\nafter you break the enemy ace.\nThat's important.
You have to play with your head, Ishizaki.\nNot just your face.
Lay off!
When we played Nankatsu,\nI couldn't just pour everything into defense,\nI had to also cover offense.
But with this team I can focus on my mark.
That way I can use my sharp skills to mow down\nthe competition!
Do you think I can do it?
Sounds like harvest season!
You think it's easy? You need to have ability\nand the smarts.
If you still think you can handle it,\nI wouldn't mind showing you the ropes.
I think it would be good to learn from\nSoda's ferocious defense.
Getting marked by Soda during a match might teach\nyou something.
Ha! That's a great line! I might borrow that.
Ha! Makes me think of Halloween.
You gonna say "trick or treat" to the enemy ace?
No, I don't think I'm going to be asking for or\noffering candy...
A-Anyway, I think I should study against\nSoda's strong defensive skills.
Getting marked by Soda during a match might show\nyou something.
Okay guys, break's over.\nLet's get back to practice!
Wow, Soda. You had <avatar_name> on lockdown.
So, <avatar_name>? Did you figure anything out\nfrom our little showdown?
I can tell from the look on your face you did.
Listen, when you're on man-to-man defense duty,\nyou do everything you can to keep your mark busy.
You go at them with everything you have.\nEverything you got. Maneuvering, feints,\nand maybe even get a little physical.
You usually want to be marking the ace, and if you\nmess up, it can lead to a sticky situation for the\nteam. You understand, right?
Depending on your team's strategy,\nyou might be put in that position.
Remember what I told you when the time comes.
Now, it's your turn to use those razor-sharp\nsoccer skills we've been working on to cut\nthe legs from under the other team.
Move it, people!\nOutta the way unless you wanna get hurt!
Huh?!
Wha...?!
Eh?!
You there!
Watch out, <avatar_name>!
Watch out, <avatar_name>!
Watch out, <avatar_name>!
C'mon now, really? You seemed pretty good in our\nmatch, but you're telling me that was just a\nfluke?
C'mon now, really?\nI got curious about you after our match, but\nyou're telling me that was just a fluke?
C'mon now, really? I came all this way to see the\namazing first year everyone's talking about, and\nthat's all you've got?
Stop spacing out, man!
You just caught me by surprise!
I let you have that one.
Your fault for letting down your guard on the\nfield.
What the heck?! Why you cocky little...
Whatever.\nOur match is already over, so it's unlikely we'll\nmeet again unless you're chosen as a rep.
And good luck with that... You'll need it!
Whatever. With skills like that, I'll eat you\nalive. Good luck! You'll need it!
Azumaichi MS would've eaten you alive, but you\nlucked out since we're not matched up.
Good luck! You'll need it!
Wait, what are you...?
Bwuh?!
How do you like them apples?!
Got a problem?
What? He turned it around on me!
Ugh! Now, I look stupid...
Still, you've got more guts than I thought.\nI like your attitude.
Our match gave me that impression,\nbut your tackle's not half bad.
And that tackle just now was based on my\nRazor Tackle, right? Jeez, you're somethin'!
And that tackle just now was based on mine,\nright? Jeez, you're somethin'!
But you've still got a long way to go before you\nmeasure up. I could coach you, if you like.
You wanna do good in the league,\nso they pick you as a rep, right?\nCan't hurt to get more training in, can it?
I'll be your practice partner, so bring it on!
C'mon, what was that?! Too slow! Too weak!\nYou'll never steal the ball like that!
Drive your leg in there like you mean it! Eat a\nfoul if you have to! That's how real tackles work!
Wha...?
Remember that sharpness just now, <avatar_name>!\nThat's the REAL Razor Tackle!
Jeez, I can't believe you picked it up so fast.\nYou're no ordinary fella.
Well, I guess that was pretty obvious after\nseeing you in our match, but I still can't\nbelieve you're just a first year!
I said this before, but the better you do in the\nleague, the closer you get to becoming a rep.
So let's make sure we both get picked, alright?
Well, I kinda had that feeling after seeing your\nmatches, but I still can't believe you're just a\nfirst-year!
Maybe...\nJust maybe we'll see each other as reps...?
Well, I kinda had that feeling after seeing your\nmatches, but I still can't believe you're just a\nfirst-year!
Too bad your school's in a different league.\nI would've liked to face you.
So how about we both make sure we're picked as\nreps instead?
Whoa. That's my Razor Shot, right?
I didn't know much about you back in the Junior\nHero League, but you really get things done, huh?
Earlier you were practicing tackles based on my\nRazor Tackle, right?
And now you're copying the shot, too? Well aren't\nyou just adorable.
We're on the same team now, so don't be shy!\nAsk me anything!
I remember seeing you play in our match,\n<avatar_name>.
Come to think of it, it's not just the shot, huh?\nThat tackle you were practicing was based on my\nsmooth skills, too, right?
I coulda just taught you if you'd asked.\nWe're on the same team now. Don't be shy!
I went to see you once, back in the Junior Hero\nLeague, but you've come a long way since then.
And it's not just the shot...\nYou were practicing my tackle as well, weren't\nyou? You using me like a technique encyclopedia?
Well, maybe I scared ya after tripping you.\nThat was my bad. Sorry.
Plus, we're teammates now. I am an open book!
Still, not just my Razor Tackle but my Razor Shot\nnow, too? You my biggest fan or something?
Hah, I'm just messing with ya.\nBut I guess it does feel pretty nice having\nsomeone want to imitate ya.
Anyway, don't be shy if you have any questions.\nI'll teach you anything you want!
Might as well, since we both got picked as reps.\nThe world won't know what hit 'em!
I'll keep practicing Razor Soccer!
Could you stop badmouthing my team then?
You know it! But I'm still the inventor,\nso I'm not gonna let you outdo me.
My bad. I know better now.
I'll never say stuff like that again, promise.
Anyway, how about that practice, yeah?\nLet's do this!
Here it goes!
End of the line!
Come on!
Here I come, <avatar_name>!
Ugh... Not bad...
That was a pretty keen tackle, <avatar_name>.
Soda's was dull by comparison. I wonder why...
Anyway, I'll be heading back first. Bye!
Great job, <avatar_name>.
Not just the tackle, but everything.\nLooking sharp.
...
Actually, something's been bugging me lately.\nMind hearing me out?
This teams got aces from all the famous\nschools, right? Like Tsubasa and Hyuga.
So they're the perfect practice partners for me,\nright? I'm the Ace Killer, the merciless defender!
But they're also, like, the main force on our\nteam. I don't want to injure them in practice.
We need every edge we can get if we're gonna be\nnumber one.
So I got to thinking... Should I be holding back?
And who would that help? Or hurt?
Would that be what Tsubasa wants?
Wh-What?!
...
Who would that help...?
Wh-What?!
...
You might be onto something there.
Thanks, man. I'm starting to see the answer.
Here I come, Soda!
Bring it, Tsubasa! You're not getting past me!
Uwaaah!
You call that dribbling?!
Soda is looking better. Guess there's nothing to\nworry about after all.
Yo, <avatar_name>, great job out there!
Just like you said.\nMy concerns were completely unfounded.
But the competition in this tourney is so fierce.\nWe'll have to improve if we want to be the best.
Naturally, we don't want to hurt each other, but\nthe only way we are going to improve our game is\nby playing earnestly during practice.
We all need to play hard to take down our\nopponents. It's important that we keep improving\nas a team. That's what you meant to say, isn't it?
Good grief. Took you long enough.
As long as you understand that, we're good.
Jeez... Look at you acting all high and mighty.
But seriously, that's what makes me such a\nreliable teammate.
I'd rather you didn't talk down to me...
But hey... I appreciate your concern.
Even so, when I first met you, you were a\ncompletely unreliable freshman, and now, you're a\nregular on the national team.
I never thought you'd amount to anything... Let\nalone become such a great player.
Alright! You and I are gonna make this the best\nteam in the world!
We'll show the rest of the world what our Razor\nSoccer can really do!
You know, <avatar_name>. The Razor Shot can be\nused for passing, too.
Don't underestimate its use as a pass. This\ntechnique is actually more difficult to pull off.
Think about it.\nThe mouth of the goal doesn't move, right?
So with the Razor Shot, you're fine as long as\nyou wind up and kick it as hard as you can into a\nplace outside the goalie's reach.
But the Razor Pass is different. You have to\nadjust the bend, speed, and distance to match the\nspeed and movement of your teammate.
That means that pulling off one of these passes\non the fly takes some serious intuition.
Is yours as good as mine? Well, give it a try out\non the pitch! I can't wait to see what you can do!
Want me to tell you how to take on Azumaichi MS?\nI'll make it quick.
And besides, they may very well be our rival next\nyear. Your rival...
Well, anyway... Listen up. Here's what I know.
I know we've got bigger fish to fry right now,\nand this is hardly the time to be talking about\nall this, but I'll tell you anyway...
Azumaichi MS is a defensive team. I was obviously\nthe heart of that team, but make no mistake about\nit... Everyone is well-trained and capable.
Tackling is what we do best. The faster and\nsharper the tackle, the more it will strike fear\ninto the hearts of your opponents.
When the opponent has the ball, close in on them\nquickly! If you can do this consistently as a\nteam, it'll put serious pressure on your opponent.
And over time they'll start to make mistakes, so\nyou can counter by stealing the ball when they\nmiss their shots and passes.
Keep that in mind for next year. Not that it'll\nnecessarily be enough to best Azumaichi MS.
Despite what I've told you, rest assured that my\njuniors won't go down without a fight.
I can't wait... to see my juniors blow you outta\nthe water!
Here I come, Morisaki! Razor Shot!
Bring it on!
Ha! Nailed it! My extra blade does it again!
Darn it! I thought I was prepared for the two\nkinds of Razor Shot!
That just now, <avatar_name>, was my specialty...\nThe Double-Bladed Razor Shot.
Kicking the ball in the opposite direction of a\nnormal Razor Shot sends the goalkeeper in the\nwrong direction, making it an easy goal.
I'm feeling generous today, so I guess I'll teach\nit to you. You can already do a Razor Shot, so\nlearning this is sure to come in handy.
Well, in truth, the form is a bit different, so\nyour opponent might see it coming...\nLike with Tsubasa at Nationals.
But I'm determined to pull off this technique\nusing the exact same form as the Razor Shot\nsomeday!
<avatar_name>, the defense you displayed in that\nlast match... Absolutely incredible!
You were right to stick so tenaciously to the\nopponent's ace!
If their ace were allowed to run wild, you'd never\nbe able to take control of the match. That's why\nit's critical that you get under his skin.
I'm not telling you to break the rules or\nanything... but you can get away with bending\nthem with a little tackle here and there.
A good tackle will cause your opponent to lose\nheart. They'll grow increasingly hesitant to play\nat full speed.
It's the number one reason they call me the Ace\nKiller.
Okay. In the next match, we'll both trip up the\nopponent's ace.
Japan's Ace Killers are about to show the world\nwhat they can do!
Move it, people!\nOutta the way unless you wanna get hurt!
No way!

Your fault for letting down your guard on the\nfield.
What the heck?! Why you cocky little...
Whatever.\nOur match is already over, so it's unlikely we'll\nmeet again unless you're chosen as a rep.
And good luck with that... You'll need it!
Whatever. With skills like that, I'll eat you\nalive. Good luck! You'll need it!
Azumaichi MS would've eaten you alive, but you\nlucked out since we're not matched up.
And good luck with that... You'll need it!







Hyah!
Bow down!
Got the moves!
Here we go!

I did it, Mom! Did you see?
Heh, we did it, guys!
Ya can't call it a fluke!
See? I can do it, too!
Heh, I can pull it off when it counts!
Nothin' to it!
I'm not gonna suck forever!
Tighten defenses and turn this around!
Keep this up and it's in the bag!
Time we show 'em what we're made of!
Relax! Just do your best and we're good!
Calm down! I'll try to calm down first!
Don't give up! Hang tough!
Awesome sauce!
That's the one!
Looking good!
Oof!
Whoops.
Break 'em!
Sweet pass!
I'm untouchable!
Y'know me!
Here I go!
I'm open!
Get me that ball!
Send 'er here!
Pass it here!
Boom!
Got ya!
Here it goes!
Why you!
A-Am I dreaming? I beat Tsubasa?
Heh, nice one, Tsubasa!
Alright! I beat Hyuga!
Dangit! I knew Hyuga would be tough...
Look how good I've gotten, Misaki!
Gah, shoulda known Misaki was too good.
I won't lose a battle of wills!
Dangit! How could lose a battle of guts!
Jeez! I can hear his fans shouting.
How are you so good, Misugi...
Can't keep me down, Masao!
Man! Next time I'll get through, Masao!
Y'won't slow me down, Kazuo!
Gah! Next time I'll push through, Kazuo!
I'm a Nankatsu SC veteran, too, Nitta!
Dangit! These young'uns!
I got more heart than you, Jito!
Dangit, he's got that warrior spirit!
Heh heh... Guess you're all talk, Soda!
Dangit, Soda! Guess you're not all talk!
The Shutetsu Quartet is past its prime!
Dangit, that's a bridge too far...
The Shutetsu Quartet is past its prime!
So I'm just here to make you look good?
The Shutetsu Quartet is past its prime!
Jeez, I thought already knew his deal.
The Shutetsu Quartet is past its prime!
Jeez, he got me good!
Heh heh, this one's mine, Urabe!
Dangit, I'll get you next time, Urabe!
It's all about your will, Schneider!
Schneider... Figures.
Heh heh, you're so full of holes, Heine!
Dangit, my goat's been got!
Wait, that works on Pierre?!
Misaki told me all about you, Pierre.
Heh! I didn't expect to find an opening!
Dang! I could learn a thing or two!
Y'got guts, then y'got all ya need!
Dang! He's got skill AND guts!
When opportunity knocks, I answer!
Dangit! Guess I'm no match for him!
Alright! That even worked on Carlos!
Gah! You won't get me next time, Carlos!
Ha! Guess I'm a soccer prodigy, too!
Dang! This guy's on Tsubasa's level...
You've got skill, but you need heart!
Y-You've got some technique, Senghor!
Heh, you thought too little of me, Ryan!
My spirit remains unbroken, Ryan!
Sorry Blake, but Hyuga's way scarier!
Dangit! That guy's unstoppable!
Aww... And that was my time to shine.
Man, I am so embarrassed.
Heh, guess we're the golden gravel duo?
Why does stuff only ever happen to me?
Ha! Well, at least you got some pep!
This is it! We settle this now!
That shot's not gettin' past me!
Ngh... Even after all this time,\nthose shot still sting. I stop 'em, though!
(Jito can actually block Tsubasa's Drive Shot...\nHis defense is astounding.)
What's eating you, Ishizaki? You're awful quiet\ntoday. Normally, you'd be cheering up a storm.
Well, I...\nHeh, yeah, I guess I'm just a bit off today.
Is something bothering you?\nYou can talk to me if you want.
Oh no, it's nothing major, really.
I keep thinking if I were big like Jito I could\nblock more shots. It just frustrates me sometimes.
I hear that. With a body like that, you wouldn't\nhafta worry about getting overpowered by anyone.
But dude, you always pull through and block\nthe shots when it counts.
See, that's the problem.
I'm basically useless, except when it's do-or-die.
I don't think so.
Good point!
Well, I'm glad you don't, but that's how it seems\nfrom here these days.
Hmm, I'm with <avatar_name> on this one.
That said, it does feel like you do your best work\nwhen we're in trouble.
Yeah...
I don't really see it that way,\nbut you know yourself better than anyone.
For some reason, when my back's against the wall,\nsomething kicks in.
But imagine if I could play like that\nall the time...\nIt's not like I'm slacking off in training.
I see what you're saying.
And I know I'd be better for the team\nif I could use that power all the time.
...
Well, what if you looked at it like this?
Huh... You're totally right.
I'll give it a test run during practice!
Alright, from the afternoon,\nlet's rotate players and keep going.
Yes, now it's my turn!\nTime to fire up the goal-scoring machine!
Hey, can I ask you guys a favor?
During the match, if they pass to the forwards,\ncan you give them space to try to take a shot?
You've got a plan?
Are you sure you can stop them?
Yeah. I'll be winging it a bit, but I wanna try\nthat thought process we discussed earlier.
Y-You would ask me that...?
Look, I don't know if it's gonna work, but I wanna\ntry that thought process we discussed earlier.
Uh, I'm not sure what's going on, but okay,\ngo for it. That's what practice is for, right?
And I'll be protecting the goal, too.\nTrust yourself and give whatever it is a try.
Thanks, guys. I'm counting on you!
(Ishizaki looks like he's really ready to go,\neven more so than usual.)
(I get the feeling if we don't take this practice\nseriously, we're going to get stomped on.)
Alright, time to get the first goal of the game!
Go, Falcon Shot!
That's not gonna fly!
Wh-What?!
(Ugh. They've got a two-point lead,\nand there's not much time left.)
(But, dang it, I'm a striker. Even if we lose,\nI'm at least getting us another goal!)
Chew on this Tiger Shot!
Not today!
N-No way!
Crud! I don't care if it's just practice,\nlosing still sucks!
We took so many shots, but you blocked them again\nand again. That's the best I've seen you play.
Yeah. I felt a vibe before the match, but there\nreally is something different about you today.
Haha! You think so? Thanks.
To tell the truth, Matsuyama gave me some\nadvice about my mindset going into matches,\nbut I didn't expect it to work this well.
I didn't think I said anything that clever, but\nif you got something out of it, all the better.
What did you say?
Well, he was worried about playing as hard as he\ncan all the time, rather than just when the chips\nare down.
So, I suggested that whenever someone's coming\nat him, he needs to think of it as do-or-die.\nThat's pretty much it.
You changed so much from just that?\nIf we'd only known you were so simple sooner...
Cram it!
Well, I got to thinking, maybe the reason I could\nonly play hard at the last moment was because\nI was relying on you guys too much.
Like, even if I was scored on, you would go\nand score on them right away.
Ishizaki...
But the battle to be the world's finest is fierce.\nThe difference of me blocking a single goal could\nbe the difference of us winning or losing.
When that hit me, I was able to find the strength\nthat I normally only have when things aren't\nlooking good.
<avatar_name>, I think you should take\nIshizaki's lesson to heart, too.
Seems like it could be very handy.
Alright, Jito, <avatar_name>.\nTime for us to shore up our defenses!\nNothing gets to Japan's goal through us!
Don't gotta tell me twice!
When you get desperate, you make even me look bad.\nIf you can play on tilt all the time,\nwe're gonna be doin' some damage on the field!
Oh, if it isn't the first year student\neverybody's been talkin' about! Your name...\nIt's <avatar_name>, right?
Tak! And you're Ishizaki, aren't you?
Umm, what was your name again?
Oh, wow! You know who I am! That's fantastic!
Eh, you seriously don't know? How rude of you!
I guess I'll let it go... this time.
You're already a Furano regular in your first\nyear, right? That's insane!
You're already a Musashi regular in your first\nyear, right? That's insane!
You're already a Toho Academy regular in your\nfirst year, right? That's insane!
So the next match is between you guys and us from\nNankatsu! I'm totally stoked!
We're in the same league, so we'll be squaring\noff eventually. I'm totally stoked!
Alright, then! See you around!
Yo, <avatar_name>!
I was watching you during the previous match.\nGood job out there!
That said... I would have liked to see a gutsier\nperformance out of you.
Guts are what being a soccer player is all about.
You certainly have guts, Ishizaki.
Yeah, Ishizaki? And what about hair?
Hahaha! You know it! I've got guts and then some!
You think my sleek scalp is the secret to my\nsuccess? Ha! That's crazy talk...
Well, anyway. Whether it's with your head or\nlegs, the point is to chase down the ball.
Watch out!
Watch out, <avatar_name>!
Ngh!
Are you okay, Ishizaki?!
Owww...
...Okay, <avatar_name>.\nI'll show you what having guts is all about.
Ishizaki... If you pick it up now...
Sh-Shush! Soccer players aren't allowed to use\ntheir hands!
Yeah, but... This isn't a game.
The next match is about to begin, <avatar_name>.\nAnd we're up!
Sure, our game was the league final.
Heh, I can't wait to face off against you!
Alright! We got it!
That face block was something else, <avatar_name>!
Maybe you were trying to channel me in your play?\nI'm happy if you were!
Yeah, <avatar_name>! Way to go!
It looks like my instruction is paying some\ndividends!
S'just practice.\nAre we really gonna run our legs off?
C'mon, Jito. You know better than to take it easy.
I mean, we're the dream team! We've gotta give it\nour all! <avatar_name>!
I'll lead the team to victory myself!
I'm doing my best to learn from you!
That's a pretty bold statement!\nYou've a high standard to live up to!
Hahaha! Flattery will get you nowhere!
Alright, <avatar_name>!\nLet's keep fighting the good fight!
How would you like a... Razor Tackle!
Do ya really think that weird shot will break\nthrough my block!
I'll defend this side!\nTake care of the left, Soda!
Got it!
Can you handle a header?!
Okay, Jito! Follow me!
Roger!
...
...
Yo, <avatar_name>.
You've been playing great lately! You're really\nimpressive for a first-year student.
Oof...
Something wrong?
Wait, what? Is something bothering you, Ishizaki?
It's nothing. Just...\nWell, do you mind listening for a bit?
Pfft... I wouldn't go that far...
But, umm, well, hear me out.
We've really assembled quite the dream team here,\nand the position battles are fiercely competitive.
You've grown by leaps and\nbounds since we first met.
Well, I'm sure it's tough for you, too...\nPlaying midfield and all.
Tsubasa, Misaki, Takeshi, Masao, Kazuo, Sano, and\nIzawa... Competing with the likes of them is\noverwhelming to put it mildly.
Forget I said anything...
Well, I'm sure it's tough for you, too...\nPlaying forward and all.
Forget I said anything...
Soda, Jito, and Takasugi are already on defense.\nThen Matsuyama and Urabe also made the move from\nmidfield to defense. All are formidable players.
As skilled as I am, I sometimes feel a little\nuneasy about representing this team going forward.
Worrying won't solve anything, Ishizaki.
Isn't this when you need guts the most?
What...?!
You know... I guess you're right.\nWorrying won't do me any good.
The one thing that will help is some good old\nfashioned practice!
Right. You're right.\nThis is no time to be worrying.
Being gutsier than anyone is what makes me who I\nam! Learning to unleash that quality is practice\nin itself!
Alright, then! I'm gonna go for a run!\nYou're coming, too, <avatar_name>.
(Ishizaki...)
Okay, <avatar_name>. Let's hustle!
Ishizaki, <avatar_name>. Do you mind if I join?
Tsubasa?
Of course, it's okay. Right, <avatar_name>?
Phew. Training with Tsubasa is tough.
But training with Japan's best player of all\npeople! <avatar_name>, isn't this awesome?!
For sure.
Huh?
It's not every day that you get to train with\nJapan's two gutsiest players.
Tsubasa...
Ishizaki has been a fierce player for as long as\nI can remember, <avatar_name>.
I've seen him battle through a leg injury to stay\nin the game, knowing there was nobody who could\nreplace him.
I've seen him crash headfirst into the goalpost,\npreventing a goal when his team was in dire\nstraits.
And he was harsh but fair with me when I'd become\ntoo focused on scoring goals to see what was\ngoing on around me.
Stop it, Tsubasa. You're embarrassing me.
But it's the truth. What's wrong with that?
I think you're extremely lucky to be learning\nfrom Ishizaki, <avatar_name>.
Continue to carry the team to victory with your\ngutsiness, guys!
You can count on us!
I could probably do it on my own!
Racja! We've got this, Tsubasa!
Ballsy! But I'm not letting you outpace me\nanytime soon!
Achoo!
Whoa, Tsubasa. Don't catch a cold.
We'll clean up here, so go ahead and get back to\nthe locker room.
But...
It's fine! Don't worry! We can't have you getting\nsick on us!
Thanks. I'll go change, then.
Leading the team to victory with our gutsiness,\neh...
Looks like you're already an indispensable member\nof this team, <avatar_name>!
We've made it through to the prelims, but we've\nstill got a long way to go before we're number\none in the world.
If we stay tough, we can burn through the\ncompetition!
We got through the prelims, but we've still got\nthe finals ahead of us. We're bound to face our\nmost daunting opponents to date.
But don't worry. Our guts will carry us through\nthe finals tournament and onto the champion's\npodium!
Just two more to go until we achieve our goal of\nbeing the best in the world.\nIt's so close, I can feel it at my fingertips.
But this is no time to pump the brakes.\nWe've gotta keep the pedal to the metal and pull\nout these last two wins!
The finals are the only thing standing between us\nand our goal of being recognized as the world's\ngreatest team.
We've come this far, so let's give it everything\nwe've got.
<avatar_name>, our combined guts are guaranteed\nto earn us the top spot in the world!
<avatar_name>! Your defense in the last match was\nout of this world!
I've always thought you had moxie, but that was\nreally something else! Though I guess, I'd expect\nnothing less from someone under my tutelage!
Well? I bet you must feel great after defending\nlike that!
I sure do!
I was just doing my job...
Right?! How can I describe it? It's like\na..."Heck yeah! I did it!" kind of feeling!
Whoa, seriously? Don't sell yourself short.
You should let yourself feel good when you pull\noff a performance like that!
You should also encourage your supporting\nteammates when they make gutsy plays!\nIt'll rev up the level of play!
You're as bold as I am, <avatar_name>!\nPlay your heart out!
What's with the crowd?
Seems like there's a juggling show underway.
That looks easy enough. I'm sure I can do it, too!
Huh?!
Hold up! It may look easy,\nbut it's actually incredibly difficult!
Well, then. Watch this!\nLet's do this, <avatar_name>!
Me...?!
Yeah, okay!
Of course! We'll shock 'em all!
Ugh. Ishizaki always gets so carried away...
And <avatar_name>, too.\nYou've gotta be kidding me...
Ugh. Those two always get so carried away...
No way...
Ishizaki did it.
You were saying, Urabe?
I was saying you shouldn't get carried away!\nYou just got lucky this time is all!
What are you talking about?\nGetting carried away brings out the best in me!
I think he's right...\nIshizaki was moving really fluidly.
Well, of course you move better when you're in a\ngood mood!
Eh... Hard to refute that.
I see. So Ishizaki's right...\nIt's important to get carried away sometimes.
Here's a shot for ya!
Darn it all!
Huh?!
Watch out, Ishizaki! You're gonna hit the post!
Grah!
Ishizaki!
Owww...
Are you okay, Ishizaki?!
Hehehe! It'll take more than that to slow me down!
But you don't need to go barreling headfirst into\na goalpost during a meaningless scrimmage...
Seriously!\nGetting that reckless during practice will...
What a daring play, Ishizaki!
What do you guys know?!
I'm just getting started, <avatar_name>.\nThere's way more where that came from!
Who cares if I was being reckless?!\nI mean, it's just practice, after all.
Listen up, <avatar_name>.\nAnd commit this to memory.
When playing a game, you'll naturally play harder\nthan you do in practice, so go hard in practice,\nand you'll go even harder in real games!
Hmm... Maybe I could stand to be a little bolder.
Then when game time comes, I'll play with way\nmore guts!
Oh, if it isn't the first year student\neverybody's been talkin' about! Your name...\nIt's <avatar_name>, right?
Tak! And you're Ishizaki, aren't you?
Umm, what was your name again?
Oh, wow! You know who I am! That's fantastic!
Eh, you seriously don't know? How rude of you!
I guess I'll let it go... this time.
You're already a Furano regular in your first\nyear, right? That's insane!
You're already a Musashi regular in your first\nyear, right? That's insane!
You're already a Toho Academy regular in your\nfirst year, right? That's insane!
You're already a Hanawa regular in\nyour first year, right? That's insane!
So the next match is between you guys and us from\nNankatsu! I'm totally stoked!
We're in the same league, so we'll be squaring\noff eventually. I'm totally stoked!
Alright, then! See you around!
Well, see ya!\nSay hi to the Tachibana brothers for me!






You're already an Hirado MS regular in your first\nyear, right? Not bad!


Well, see ya!\nSay hi to Jito and the others for me!





S'just practice.\nAre we really gonna run our legs off?
C'mon, Soda. You know better than to take it easy.






C'mon, what's the matter?! You think you can be\na regular at Nankatsu if you get tired after a\nlittle warm-up like that?
I'm just getting started!
I-I'm just catching my breath.
Ha ha! Keep believing that and someday it'll\ncome true! That's what strength really is!
Sheesh, you gotta do better than that.\nWhere's your spirit?
Well, I guess you're just a first year...\nYou can't help it if you don't have as much\nstamina as us yet.
Okay, fine, take a quick break.\nWe need you at your best in training!
You've gotta be the one carrying Nankatsu\nnext year. This is just a small hurdle.
I've got high hopes for you. About as much as\nI had for Tsubasa back when we first met.
Not that you'd be a match for him even back then!
So keep on training, and reach his level.\nHe for sure trained his butt off, y'know.
I've been by his side the longest of anyone,\nso I know what I'm talking about.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that hard work\nand a can-do attitude will never betray you.\nWhatever else happens, never forget that.
Oh, looks like you caught your breath\nwhile we were chatting.
Okay! Let's get back at it! Hop to it!
Alright, worked up a good sweat today!
Ha ha, maybe you'd get better results if you tried\nchanneling all that energy into something useful!
H-Hey! I'm not just messing around out there!
Whoa, watch out! Miskick!
Get down, <avatar_name>!
Ow ow ow... You okay?
Ouch... That's gotta hurt, Ishizaki.
Ha! Gutsy!
You could've just caught it...
Anything to protect our up-and-coming rookie!
Besides, this mug of mine has even stopped a\nTiger Shot before. Kisugi's miskick was nothing.
Still, couldn't you have just caught it?\nYou know, with your hands? Seems easier.
Yeah, seriously.\nWhy go out of your way to get smacked in the face?
Wh-What? I just wanted to make sure our rookie\nknew what bravery on the field looks like!
I mean, what kind of soccer player reacts to a\nsplit-second decision with his hands anyway?
A true soccer player uses his head and feet, and a\ntrue soccer player is what I am down to my spine.
Spine...?
You mean "to the bone"?
I-Is that how it goes?
A-Anyway, it should be spine, right?\nYour spine is how your brain talks to your body,\nand we're talking reflexes... so spine!
That's the spinal cord, not the spine.
Same difference. They're both in your back, right?
Um, try not to follow his example TOO much,\nalright <avatar_name>?
Oh shut up! What matters is that our future ace\nis all in one piece!
Anyway, if you wanna get those 4th and 5th\nchampionships, you'd better learn from my can\ndo spirit and never-give-up attitude!
Are those even different things?
I thought I told you to button it!



That attitude is what I wanted to teach ya!







Right on! That's what I'm talking about,\n<avatar_name>!


Alright, we did it! We won!\nI knew soccer came down to your courage!
Ha ha... But it sure wears a guy out trying\nto keep up with Ishizaki. Mentally.
Seriously. Whenever he's pulling us along,\nwe always end up using more stamina and focus.
But... doesn't it feel like we're playing at a\nhigher level, too? Like he gets us to play even\nharder and better.
Guess that's what happens when Captain Ishizaki\nis in charge.
We're counting on you, Captain!
Yeah, I know!
Listen <avatar_name>, with the right attitude you\ncan play harder than think. That's just my style.\nMy own personal take on soccer.
And don't you forget it!\nI'm sure it'll come in handy next year!
Soccer's best when the sweat's pouring,\nand you're all in! Right, Tsubasa?
You bet!
And I don't know about you, but I never feel the\nfatigue when I'm really in it.
Totally! The harder ya push,\nthe more you want to see it through!
Great minds... I feel like I could keep playing\nfor several more matches!
You hear that, <avatar_name>? No matter how hard\nit gets, keep playing with heart at 110%.
You only get tired when you've lost the will\nto win. If you keep your head in the game,\nyour body will adjust.
He's absolutely right.
And if you stay in the fight physically, your\nheart will find new strength, and you'll play\nlike you never have before.
So let's play this game we love with everything\nwe got and never regret a second!
Oh, if it isn't the first year student\neverybody's been talkin' about! Your name...\nIt's <avatar_name>, right?
Tak! And you're Ishizaki, aren't you?
Umm, what was your name again?
Oh, wow! You know who I am! That's fantastic!
Eh, you seriously don't know? How rude of you!
I guess I'll let it go... this time.
You're already a Furano regular in your first\nyear, right? That's insane!
You're already a Musashi regular in your first\nyear, right? That's insane!
You're already a Toho Academy regular in your\nfirst year, right? That's insane!
You're already an Otomo MS regular\nin your first year, right? Not bad!
So the next match is between you guys and us from\nNankatsu! I'm totally stoked!
We're in the same league, so we'll be squaring\noff eventually. I'm totally stoked!
Alright, then! See you around!
Well, see ya!\nSay hi to Urabe and the others for me!







Eat my dust!
Get wrecked!
Oh yeah!
Suck on my fumes!
Hiyah!
Hwoo!
Got somethin' for ya!























Captain!
It's all you!
You know what to do!
Get in there!
Hit 'em hard!
Let's make it happen!
Here we go!

I do more than defend!
And that's how Ken Wakashimazu does it!
My soccer wins games!
Score!
Alright! Nailed it!
Did everyone see that?
You underestimated my kick!
I'm counting on you to get us the lead!
Keep up the attack! I'll handle defense!
We won't win without giving it our best!
Sorry, that's my fault.
That's it! No more points for you!
They won't get any more! Don't give up!
Knockout!
Nice!
That is somethin'!
We're in trouble!
What is this?!
Block the way!
Nice pass!
Thanks!
I've got this!
Here I go!
I'm open!
Over here!
To me!
Pass!
It's not getting past me!
Come on! Make it in time!
I'll stop it! I have to!
Not on my watch, Tsubasa!
I won't lose to you either, Hyuga!
Misaki, you'll need more than technique!
You can't handle me, Matsuyama!
Time to pay you back for before, Misugi!
It's a neat move, but it won't work!
I respect your speed and power, Nitta.
I saw right through that spin, Soda!
Here's some of your own meds, Schneider!
I'm not to be taken lightly, Heine!
I see right through your tricks, Pierre!
Smash through me if you can, Napoleon!
No goals for you, Kluivoort!
You won't beat me with that, Rusciano!
I'm ready for even Brazil's ace!
You won't get a goal like that!
I'm never gonna lose, Diaz! Not to you!
The Black Panther, huh? Nice speed!
I hafta take those skills seriously!
You think too simple, Diallo!
Analyze me all you like, Ryan!
I won't lose to your power anymore!
A man doesn't go back on his word.
The Karate Punch Defense!
Sink or swim, my right arm will stop it!
And now my right arm's just dead...
Nice. That was a tight formation. Let's run\nthrough the defensive maneuvers one more time.
(Wakabayashi's saves are solid.\nHe doesn't leave anything to chance.)
(But I'm not about to let him outdo me.\nNot in terms of reflexes or physical ability.)
(And I'm used to strong shots. I've handled my\nfair share of Hyuga's Tiger Shots, after all.\nI can't be so weak in comparison.)
(Sure, his positioning is good, but that can't\nbe the whole story of his skill.)
Ah!
(Positioning! That's it!)
Wha...?!
Good job on the steal, <avatar_name>!
Soda! Stay on Takeshi! Takasugi, take Hyuga.\nIzawa and Ishizaki, hold center!
Got it!
I'm on it!
Keep the pressure on midfield.\nDon't give 'em space! Surround and control!
Łoł! They're pushing in super fast!
Darn it! I'm breaking through!
Well, all yours, Takeshi!
<avatar_name>! You don't stand a chance!
He's right!
Ah...
Don't sweat it, <avatar_name>! Let's switch it up!
Wait, what?!
Heh heh! I'll be taking that back, thanks!
<avatar_name>, you gotta pay a little more\nattention to what's happening to the person\nyou're passing to.
Soda was literally on top of me. There's only so\nmuch I can do to receive a pass in that situation.
Those were some good moves today, everyone.\nI was on the side lines, but I could tell\nthe defense was faster than usual.
You think so?\nCan't say I was particularly cranking it up.
Come to think of it, it feels like Wakashimazu's\ncallouts were really specific today.
You're right. Maybe that's why we were able to\nso easily maneuver together.
(Wow. Wakashimazu, eh?)
Hey <avatar_name>, Takeshi. Sorry to bug you guys\nafter practice. Got a moment?\nI wanna ask you something about practice today.
Sure.
Thanks. So...
You guys were closing in fast,\nmaking it harder for us to figure out what to do.\nMore so than usual...
I see. Awesome.\nLooks like what I was trying worked.
What was that?
Nothing major. I just gave everyone more\ninstructions than usual.
To be exact, you know when the ball gets brought\nto your side and you start to focus on it and\nlose sight of what's going on around you?
I tried giving my teammates thorough support,\nso they could move more effectively.
You hear it all the time, right? Goalies are at\nthe very back of the defense, so they can see\nhow the whole field comes together.
So that's why the defense was moving so fast.
I'm always checking out my surroundings,\nbut sometimes I respond slower for it,\nso support like that helps a lot.
Thinking about it, I'm not sure\nI gave the defenders that much direction.
If anything, I was paying attention to my own\npositioning and the opponents' movements.
I think I most hung back, waiting to make sure\nI could stop whatever came at me.
But I realized if I wanna be competitive\ninternationally, I gotta step it up.
When I saw Wakabayashi playing, he was paying\nattention to those finer details.\nAnd he never lost focus of his own defense.
Since I'm competing against him to be the main\nkeeper rep, I can't just walk my own path.\nI gotta assimilate his strengths, too.
Wow, Wakashimazu...
Thanks, you two.\nSorry for bothering you after practice.
I'm gonna go train a little more before\nheading back. See ya later.
It's important to do what he did today and cover\nother players' blind spots with good callouts.
Even though we're the younger crowd,\nwhen we're on the pitch, our age doesn't matter.
Let's be more proactive with calls,\neven to the older players!
Hey guys. Well done today.
Hey, Wakabayashi! Thanks. You, too!
I couldn't help but overhear...\nWere you talking about Wakashimazu?
Y-Yeah.
I was watching him play. His observations on the\nfield were spot on. It's no wonder the defense\nmoved so well.
His shout out showed he was thinking about\ndefense from the opponent's perspective.
What do you mean?
My guess is he's got half his mind on playing\noffense, so he naturally is assessing how best\nto attack.
I think that's why everybody else was able to\nsquelch the opponents' movements and move so well\nthemselves.
Ah... That sounds like Wakashimazu alright.
Other players could learn a lot from his mindset,\ndon't you think?
For sure!
Well, if my rival for the main goalie spot is\nworking that hard, I'll have to work even harder.
Back to training for me. You guys keep truckin'!
Wakashimazu and Wakabayashi both said some\ngood stuff.
Communication to keep our team in motion...\nGonna try thinking about that from now on!
Huh? What's up with you?
Please, practice shooting with me!
Let me play against you, Wakashimazu!
A first-year student wants to practice with me?
You've got guts, kid... Showing no fear toward an\nolder student. I respect your courage.
Play against me?
Well, we may be teammates, but we really haven't\nhad many chances to play together.
Sure, I'm game. Get out on the field.
Alright! Don't hesitate! Just shoot!
You certainly have a pretty good shot for a first\nyear, but you've still got a long way to go\nbefore you'll be scoring goals on me.
But partnering up with me to work on your shot\nlike this... I gotta hand it to you, kid.
It will be up to you and Takeshi to carry Toho\nAcademy when we're gone next year.
If you want to improve, just say the word.\nI'm more than happy to give you a hand.
Alright, then! C'mon, <avatar_name>!
Darn... That Tiger Shot is really something!
You're not captain material yet,\nbut you're undoubtedly skilled.
Ngh... <avatar_name>.\nI can't believe you can shoot like that!
You're not as good as Tsubasa yet,\nbut that was really impressive.
And believe me, I say that as someone who has\ntaken some of Tsubasa's best shots.
Ngh... <avatar_name>, you've clearly improved!\nThat last shot was stellar!
I could tell you had a good head on your\nshoulders during the tryouts, but I never\nimagined you'd improve this quickly.
You're already a Toho Academy regular at this\npoint. You're as helpful to me and the captain as\nyou are to the rest of the team.
That's because I always give it my all!
That's because I love soccer!
The competition to remain on the starting lineup\nis fierce. You'll need to outshine the rest if\nyou want to stick around.
You go out of your way to compete with rivals and\nimprove your skills... And that makes you a\nreally great fit for this school.
I see... That's important.
My family home is a karate dojo. My father wants\nme to follow in his footsteps.
But me? I want to keep on playing soccer.
Alright, let's keep practicing, <avatar_name>!
Our goal is to win out in the Junior Hero League\nand make the all-Japan team after that! Let's get\nto work!
Oh, it's you...
You're <avatar_name>, right?\nI thought you looked familiar.
<avatar_name>... I remember you.\nYou played well against us.
You're...<avatar_name>, right?\nI remember seeing you play awhile back.
So why did you come all the way here?\nCan I do somethin' for ya?
Please, faceoff with me!
Please, evaluate my shot for me!
Showing up out of the blue\nwith a request like that...\nDo you intend to off your rivals one by one?
It sounds obvious, but a shot is something you\nmake toward your opponents. So you're right,\nthey may be the best people to judge it.
I hate for you to have come all this way for\nnothing. But our practice is just about to start.
Today won't work, but if the opportunity presents\nitself again, I'd be happy to hear you out.
See ya around and get home safe.
Oh, you're back, <avatar_name>.
Do you remember your promise?
Please, help me out this time!
Yeah, of course I remember.
You came all this way and maintained that fire in\nyour eyes... I couldn't say no if I wanted to.
Team practice just finished, so this time, I can\ntrain with you!
Alright! Come and get it, <avatar_name>!
Ugh... No way! How do you know the Tiger Shot?!
Oh, I see. So you talked to the captain and had\nhim teach you.
Talking to not only me but the captain as well...\nYour eagerness to learn is really commendable.
I want to see more of you in action! You really\nseem to have a high ceiling!
Ngh... <avatar_name>.\nI can't believe you can handle that shot!
You're not as good as Tsubasa, but that was\nreally impressive.
And believe me, I say that as someone who has\ntaken some of Tsubasa's best shots.
I want to see more of you in action! You really\nseem to have a high ceiling!
Matsuyama's shot!\nAnd a pretty powerful version at that!
I see. So you asked Matsuyama to teach you. It's\nno wonder, then...
Asking different players to teach you shows the\nbest kind of eagerness, <avatar_name>.
I want to see more of you in action! You seem to\nsoak up technique like a sponge!
Misugi's shot! And with solid control and curve...
I see. So you asked Misugi to teach you.\nIt's no wonder, then...
Asking different players to teach you shows the\nbest kind of eagerness, <avatar_name>.
I want to see more of you in action! You really\nseem to be able to learn a lot!
That shot won't work on me yet,\nand I feel like there's room for improvement.\nI want to see more of you in action!
In addition to the captain, the Junior Hero\nLeague includes Tsubasa, Matsuyama, and Misugi.\nMaybe try asking them to teach you their shots?
It's sure to make your play more versatile than\never.
Well, it's getting kinda late.\nLet's run a bit before heading home.
The next time we meet, it'll be on the field.
And I'm gonna stop every shot you send my way!\nYou've been warned!
I'm sure the next time we meet will be in\ntraining camp. I can't imagine you not being\npicked.
Be careful not to get hurt out there!
*pant* *pant*
<avatar_name>...
What've I been up to? Karate practice.
"My family home is a Wakado Style Karate dojo.\nI've been training since I was young."
Though I've been so busy with soccer lately that\nI've hardly had time for it...
Which reminds me, we really don't cross paths at\nschool often, so I haven't had much of a chance\nto talk to you.
But the fact that you're not only a Toho Academy\nregular but also a rep is a testament to the\nskills you exhibited during trials.
Speaking of... We haven't trained together much\nlately. Have you been working on your shots?
Come talk to me again some time.
By the way, your efforts have really paid off!\nI'm glad to have you as a fellow rep!
By the way, <avatar_name>. You becoming a fellow\nrep really shows how amazing you've been lately.
To be honest, I didn't pay much attention to you\nin the Junior Hero League. I'm kinda embarrassed\nto admit that.
Speaking of which, <avatar_name>. You've\nseriously been getting the job done out there.
You stole several goals from me. I knew you were\nno ordinary player, but I never expected that.
I thought I'd get you back next time, but we're\nteammates trying to be the best in the world now,\nso I'm counting on you to do more of the same.
By the way, you came to the school before, didn't\nyou? Sorry about that.
But we're teammates now.\nDon't hesitate to talk to me whenever.
That reminds me, <avatar_name>. You've been\nincredible lately. I'm glad I was right about you.
Ever since I took your shots back at the school,\nI've had high hopes about what you'd be able to\naccomplish.
And now, as your teammate, it's become clear to\nme that you still have room to grow.
If you're looking to improve even further, feel\nfree to train with me all you want. We're fellow\nreps after all! All you have to do is ask!
Thanks! I really appreciate it!
Feel free to ask me, too, Wakashimazu!
You can count on me!
Well, aren't we confident?
I haven't forgotten how badly we were humiliated\nin that international scrimmage.
Let's play hard and elevate our games to a higher\nlevel, <avatar_name>!
We'll be the best in the world!
Let's do this, Wakashimazu!
Ugh!
You tired, Wakashimazu?\nYou're not reacting as quickly.
No! I'm fine! Give me one more chance!
Wakashimazu, let's call it a day. You're not the\nonly one. Hyuga is also on his last legs...
Okay, I understand.\nSorry if I came across as selfish.
No, I...
Thank you. But I'll take it from here.\nYou go on ahead.
Alright. I'll go on ahead and get a massage. I'll\nrequest one for you as well, Wakashimazu.
Okay, cool.
<avatar_name>... Were you watching?
Why do you practice so recklessly?
You don't have to push yourself so hard.
Isn't it obvious?\nI have a lot of rivals looking to lay me out.
You don't understand. There are a lot of people\nwho want to take me down.
When I was selected as a rep and came to America,\nI was extremely confident in my abilities, since\nI'm the best middle school goalkeeper in Japan.
But then I gave up a goal to America's Blake in\nthe first scrimmage...
Followed by Germany's Schneider pulling off a hat\ntrick in the first half... My confidence was torn\nto pieces.
I'm determined to put those regrets behind me in\nthis tournament.
Not to mention... Wakabayashi.
I played him only once back when I was in\nelementary school, but I know all too well how\ngood he can be.
He's an amazing goalkeeper who only got better\nafter moving to Germany.
And besides, I had to outplay a lot of players in\nJapan to get where I am now. For their sake, I\ncan't allow myself to lose to him.
Unfortunately, at this point, Wakabayashi's\nexperience against stauncher European competition\ngives him the advantage. I can't deny that.
And that's why I need to practice harder than\never if I'm to have any hope of being better in\nthe end.
Then you should play to your strengths!
You have unique talents, Wakashimazu!
My strengths?
Unique talents?
...
I see. So that's what you mean.
Thanks, <avatar_name>.\nThat's another approach I'd not thought of.
Alright, then! I know what I have to do now!
*pant* *pant*
Good morning, <avatar_name>.
Is this your morning training?
Karate is pretty cool, huh?!
I often used to train at my family home's dojo\nbefore heading to school back when I was in\nelementary school.
I've never thought of it that way before.\nYou think so?
I was thinking about what you said the other\nnight.
My "unique talents." That would be karate.
There is a huge overlap between the moves used in\nkarate and those used when goalkeeping.
So if I practice karate, that training will\nimprove my movements when goalkeeping, as well.
In other words, if I keep up with both my karate\nand goalie training, it's sure to pay dividends\nwhen I'm out on the field.
<avatar_name>... Ever since I first enrolled at\nToho Academy, I've prioritized soccer over karate.
This sometimes put me at odds with my father, who\nwanted me to devote myself to karate.
The truth is that I promised my father I'd quit\nsoccer if I didn't win at the summer Nationals\nthis year.
Your word is your bond with him. I truly intended\nto quit if I lost.
But I love soccer.\nI really didn't want to quit. That's why I played\nas hard as I could in the final.
But like I said before, karate is the foundation\nof my goalkeeping.\nYour words made me remember that.
My karate is extremely important to how I play on\nthe field.
That's why I've decided to dedicate myself to\nboth disciplines.
Not only will I be the greatest goalkeeper,\nI'll be the greatest martial artist, as well.
Soccer and karate have two-blade styles!
Your father will be thrilled, too!
True enough, but it's going to be a really\nchallenging goal.
The truth is that, after the final, I heard from\nmy mother that my father had been watching on TV\nand cheering me on.
My father isn't the reason I do karate, but if it\nmakes him happy... That's good, too.
Well, anyway... I should train a little more\nbefore breakfast.
After that, I'll practice soccer and keep upping\nmy game until I'm the best goalie there is.
We're going to be the greatest in the world,\n<avatar_name>. Let's do whatever it takes to win!
...
Wakabayashi.
Hyuga.
You worried about Wakashimazu?
Hmm... I wonder...
I've only played against him once, but there's no\ndisputing his talent.
And he's probably only going to get better,\nespecially with the way he's been practicing.
I'm sure you see him as a formidable rival.\nAren't you the least bit scared?
Hmph, no. I'm excited.
Having a strong rival motivates me to practice\nand makes me a better player.\nWouldn't you agree, Hyuga?
Yeah, you're right.
(You're the best goalkeeper I know, Wakashimazu.)
(Let's keep getting better together!)
You want me to teach you the trick to performing\na Triangle Jump?
Sorry, but no can do.
That was the first Wakado move I ever learned,\nand I've been perfecting it ever since. It's\nrichness cannot be ascertained in but a few hours.
I'm also not sure it'd be much use to you out on\nthe field.
...
But maybe the principles behind the Triangle Jump\nwould be of use to a fielder.\nI'll teach them to you if you desire.
The Triangle Jump is basically a technique you\nperform when you've determined that an ordinary\njump save won't be quick enough.
The time it takes you to recognize trouble and\nmove needs to be less than an instant.
I suppose the same is true for fielders. When you\nsee that your teammate is in trouble, you have to\nsupport him as quickly as possible.
For example, even if you're far away, or rather,\nespecially if you are, you have but a split\nsecond to take flight toward him.
I've seen cases where slight contact between your\nbody and your opponent's shot can change the\nball's trajectory and prevent a goal.
Anyway, your judgment and movement need to be as\ninstantaneous as possible to achieve your\nobjective effectively.
That's all I can tell you about the Triangle\nJump. Whether you can make use of what I just\ntold you is entirely up to you.
Your feet looked heavy in the last match,\n<avatar_name>.
The defense participating in an attack isn't a\nproblem... unless you can't get back fast enough\nafter the ball's been lost.
Even if we're the ones on the offensive, we can't\nrely on the defense if you're just slowly\ntrailing behind.
If the attack is interrupted, immediately switch\nyour mind back to defense. That awareness alone\nshould completely change the speed of your dash.
I don't mean to sound harsh, but I know you're\nbetter than you played, and I'm really counting\non you out there.
Take this, Wakabayashi!
Wha...?!
Hmph... There! Go now! The goal is unattended!
Darn it!
I got it!
(Aww, man. I'll never make it in time!)
Huh?!
Whaaa...?! <avatar_name>! You got back so fast!
Thanks, <avatar_name>. Great job getting back.
Thanks for teaching me earlier!
Gotta be more awake, Wakashimazu!
So you managed to implement my advice into your\narsenal. Well done.
I know I said the same to you earlier, but you're\nright.
If I had the same awareness and speed that you\nshowed, the defense would be stabilized, and we'd\nbe pouring it on offensively.
<avatar_name>! We're counting on you in both\nphases of the game!







Get a load of me!
Too good for you!
Here we go!
Huzzah!
Take that!
Go!
Push in!

The ball's my friend, too!
I know you guys can get us the lead!
I'll hold onto our lead!
That's it! Just keep it up!
Sorry guys!
It... It won't happen again.
Please, just get us a goal!
Good work!
Nice!
Looking good!
Oh crud.
No way!
Someone stop them!
Nice pass!
Thanks!
I've got this!
Go!
C'mon!
Here!
Over here!
Pass!
Please, make it!
I'll stop it no matter what!
I won't run away! Never!
The ball's my friend, Tsubasa!
I'm not letting you beat me, Hyuga!
I've improved too, Misaki!
I won't lose the mental battle!
Not even you, Misugi!
Masao! I'm blocking every shot you take!
Kazuo! I'm blocking every shot you take!
I'm not letting you score, Nitta!
Thank goodness I saw that spin!
I did it, Wakabayashi! I stopped it!
Don't get sloppy just because it's me!
I've got pride of my own, Pierre!
Not one goal, Napoleon!
You're not gettin' in here, Kluivoort!
H-How was that, Rusciano?!
I stopped Brazil's ace!
I-I win, Alberto!
Don't you dare look down on me, Diaz!
I've got my own pride, Victorino!
Whoa... That was close!
I won't lose the mental battle, Diallo!
I did it... I did it! Take that, Ryan!
I-I've gotten stronger, too!
I stopped it, Wakabayashi!
S-Scary...
The soccer ball's my best friend!
...
Are you okay, Morisaki?
Oh, hey Misugi.
It's not like you to watch a match so quietly.\nYou're usually yelling your head off.
Ah... I was thinking on a recent match,\nwhile seeing this one unfold.
I was thinking of how clear the flow of a match is\nwhen you can see everything like this.
After enduring the opponent's attack, the team\nwill turn around and swing into attack mode.
And after pushing the offensive, the team's\ngeneral mood often cools down and goes back\ninto a defensive stance.
So, whether it's offense or defense,\nteams ride on these sort of waves.
You're right. If you look at a match from start\nto finish, there are waves or turns at both\noffense and defense for sure.
It's important to recognize those waves if you\nwant a match to go well, which is why I'm always\ntrying to be aware of them.
From the bench, you get to see things differently\nthan players on the field.
Exactly.
Very few people can maintain focus\nfor a whole match.
So, players will concentrate when they feel\nthey need to, according to the situation.
That sounds about right.
(Match flow... As a goalie,\nhow do I take advantage of it?)
And that's where I'm at. I was thinking about\ntoday's match in terms of its ebb and flow.
You don't say... I think about that, too.
Usually, it's when the opposing team's on a roll\nthat we play with an emphasis on defense.
On the other hand, if we catch them getting tired,\nthen it's our turn. That's when we crank up our\naggressiveness, so the team's mood's important.
I see...
The flow of a match, eh? It's just a feeling,\nbut it does make a huge difference.
Definitely. Sometimes things get a little dicey\nafter going on the offensive. The whole team sorta\nhits a low and focus goes out the window.
Yeah. It's usually in times like those that\nwe find ourselves in a pinch.
That's why we gotta be extra careful then,\nwhen the team is getting poised to attack again.
Hmm...
As forwards, when the team's energy dips,\nall we can do is hang in there.
The flow favors us again eventually\nif we're patient.
And then when it does, the team pushes ahead\nand gains strength, and what matters is how much\nwe can press the attack.
Interesting. Thanks.\nIt's been good getting all sorts of input.
So, did you figure anything out?
Hmm, it takes some effort to put the picture\ntogether. Each position looks at things in their\nown way.
Well, then why not ask another keeper\nlike Wakabayashi or Wakashimazu?
Nah. I wanted to use this opportunity to talk to\nplayers who play different positions at others\nschools and figure things out on my own.
Misugi says he does that and ponders it out on\nthe bench.
That's Misugi, though.\nI'm not sure you'd be able to.
Hey! That hurts.
Besides, I think it's important for guys like us\nto be loud and hype everyone up like we always do.
Well, you're right, but I still wanted to use\nthis opportunity to think on my own.
What do you think, <avatar_name>? Any thoughts on\nwhat I was talking to everyone about today?
Think about it the other way around.
Well, goalies have a special job.
The other way around?
Oh, yeah! For us goalies, the work starts on the\nflip side of the team's attack.
Special? I suppose we do get to use our hands\nand stuff.
Wait, now I see! When the team's in a bind,\nthat's when goalkeepers hafta dig in and push!
My focus should ride a wave opposite that of\nthe team.
That way I'm ready for the slump after the team's\nattack, instead of getting caught up in the same\nhighs as the team!
Uh, you should be focused throughout the match.
Ideally you are, but like Misugi said, it's not\neasy to stay totally focused 100 percent of the\ntime 100 percent of the match.
So, I figured, as a goalie, I'm better off doing\nmy best when the team's low on energy,
than when they're high on an offensive push.
I think I see what you mean.
But maybe this isn't just a goalie thing.
Can't hurt to have people on the field who work\nharder when the team's situation cools down.
When our momentum dies down, the opponent picks up\nthe pace and goes on the attack.
So, having players who turn up the heat at those\ntimes would let us throw the opponent off balance.
I can see that. Go hard not just when everyone's\nin the zone, but also when it seems like the\nmomentum is slowing.
Okay. I'm gonna keep this in mind going forward.
I won't let everyone opening up to me go to waste!
Huh, if it isn't the first year everyone's been\ntalking about... Your name...\nIt's <avatar_name>, right?
Racja! And you're Morisaki, aren't you?
Umm, and you're... Morisaki, was it?
So you know of me! I'm happy to hear that!
Yeah, the Nankatsu goalkeeper, Yuzo Morisaki.\nPleasure to meet ya.
I heard from my team that there was a standout\nfirst year and came today to see what all the\nfuss was about.
Thanks for letting me watch you practice.\nYou move pretty well.
And that shot earlier was particularly sharp.\nYou'd definitely be a handful in a real game.
You may not be a forward, but with a shot as\nsharp as that one, you'd be a threat from\nanywhere on the field.
Indeed, I'm glad I came today.
Next time we meet will be on the field!\nI can hardly wait!
Whoa, <avatar_name>! You always shoot so well!
I watched you carefully during the match earlier.\nYour play really impressed me.\nAre you seriously only a first-year?
I think you're even better than you were back\nwhen Furano MS faced off against us.
We haven't played Musashi MS yet, but with you on\nthe team, they've gotta be tough.
Call it a hunch.
I feel like you've gotten better since we played\nyou and Toho Academy in the National finals.
You carried that game... and looked really solid\ndoing it.
But there's no way we're losing to you now!\nNot even in an exhibition!
Nankatsu is the team that won the Nationals three\nyears straight. Don't you forget it!
I plan to practice with better players!
That's where you're mistaken, Morisaki!
Good! Go for it!\nI'll stop everything you send my way!
You sure are confident! That's fine! Bring it on!\nI'll stop everything you send my way!
Hmm, maybe I spoke too soon...
But I do plan to play hard! So don't hold back!
Well, then. Lookin' forward to it!
Whoa, <avatar_name>! What a great shot!
You've really been working hard, haven't you?\nI'm trying my best to win, too, but you're really\ngoing all out.
We play different positions and haven't talked\nmuch, but cheers to you anyway!
You're shooting better than when I saw you last.
I'm also doing my best to stave off defeat, but\nit looks like you've really been putting a lot of\neffort into your game!
I really wanted to win our match in the Junior\nHero League, but you proved too much for us.
I did my best not to lose, but it's entirely\npossible that you put more effort into it than I\ndid.
If so, I need to follow your lead!
Alright, <avatar_name>! We're in the big leagues\nnow! Let's do our best!
Oh, right! We should practice!\nGive me your best shot!
Alright! Let's do it!
Take a shot, Morisaki!
Sure thing! You can count on me!
Huh?! Make a shot against you?
(Hold on... That reminds me of something I heard\na long time ago when at Nankatsu SC.)
(Roberto Hongo had Tsubasa go in goal, and by\ntaking shots himself...)
(He showed Tsubasa how there are courses that are\ndifficult for goalkeepers to react to and easy\nfor them to react to...)
(Perhaps <avatar_name> is trying to do the same\nfor me?)
Oh, okay! I've got this!\nI'll give you my best shot!
You're amazing, <avatar_name>!\nYour play is on another level!
...
So... There's something I want to ask you.\nWould you mind practicing with me this evening?
Of course not!
Hmm, tonight?
Thanks! I really appreciate it!
Please! I really want your help!
We can do it after dinner!
C'mon, bring it!
Ack... I can't defend that shot!
But I'm not giving up yet!\nFire some more at me, <avatar_name>!
Thanks so much for practicing with me today,\n<avatar_name>!
It was around elementary school when I first felt\nrespect for Wakabayashi, and I've been trying to\nmake it as a goalkeeper ever since.
But I have nowhere near the talent that he has,\nand I'm sure he tries extremely hard, too. If I\ndon't do something, the gap will only widen.
That's why I strive little by little to gradually\nget better over time. That's about all I can do.
Okay, <avatar_name>!\nPlease! Humor me a little longer!
Sorry for being so insistent on\na special training session!
Okay, let's get started!
Hold on, you two!
Huh?
If it's special training you're after, Morisaki,\nlet me lend a hand!
Back in elementary school, when Wakabayashi\nmissed the Nationals because of injury, Morisaki\ntook his place.
And we often had special training sessions!
We've been playing together for a very long time.
If it's Morisaki we're talking about, I'm willing\nto do whatever I can to help!
Everyone... Thank you!
Alright, then! Zróbmy to!
Here I come, Morisaki!
Ngh... He got it!
Yes!
I'm up next! Here goes nothing!
Oh, wow! Tsubasa missed!
I did it... I really did it!
Nice catch, Morisaki! You're perfect so far!
Uh oh, it's getting late.\nWe'll have to finish up soon.
Alright, <avatar_name>! You take the last shot!
Oh wow, <avatar_name>!
Aim for the middle of the goal.
Aim for the corner of the goal.
Łoł!
Morisaki! Are you alright?!
I'm fine! The ball's my friend!\nIt's not something scary.
Alright! Nice catch, Morisaki!
You're not getting past me!
Nice catch!
Watch out, Morisaki!\nYou're gonna hit the goalpost!
Are you okay, Morisaki?!
I-I'm fine!\nThe goalpost is also a goalkeeper's friend!
Morisaki... That was a gutsy play!
Thank you so much for helping me train, everyone!
It's fine! Don't worry!\nIt was good practice for us, as well!
Alright! Let's clean up!
Yeah, okay!
That last shot was amazing, <avatar_name>! You've\ncome far since we first met!
You've really grown a lot as a player.
You've really improved over the course of this\ntournament, <avatar_name>.\nThat last shot proved it.
Hey, <avatar_name>. Wakabayashi is big part of\nthe reason I've pushed myself this hard...
But you've had a hand in it, too.
Your play inspires me to give it everything I've\ngot.
Thanks for that.
I'm also prepared to do whatever it takes to keep\nup with you! And together, we'll take the world\nby storm!
Ah, good timing, <avatar_name>. There's something\nI wanted to give you.
It's one of my family's good luck charms.\nI've got a bunch of them, so here, take one.
Thank you very much!
But Morisaki's luck will...
It's fine! I owe you this much at least!
Will what?!
The luck of teammates equals the luck of the\nteam! That's why I want you to have it!
I mean, I don't really know if it works or not,\nbut what's the risk?
A little luck can be the difference maker in\nparticularly competitive matches.
But anyway, let's keep up the hard work,\n<avatar_name>!
What's wrong, <avatar_name>?
You looked slow at the start of today's scrimmage.
Hmm... Maybe you're the type that takes time to\n<avatar_name>get revved up?
Huh?
It's true that he started off slow, but after\nthat, he was flying all over the field, right?
Yeah, now that you mention it.
But if you think about it, picking it up in the\nsecond half when everyone is battered and beaten\nis a clever strategy in itself.
Makes sense...
It's like, in the first half, everyone covers for\n<avatar_name>, and in the second half, he covers\nfor everyone else.
Racja!
Being sluggish earlier and excelling later...\nWhat's the word for that again?\nOh, right... a late bloomer.
I thought it was a late riser.
Oh, right! Late riser works, too!
I suppose both of them apply!
But make no mistake.
Whoa, <avatar_name>! You always shoot so well!
I watched you carefully during the match earlier.\nYour play really impressed me.\nAre you seriously only a first-year?
I think Furano MS is even better now with you in\nit than when we played them before.
We haven't played Musashi MS yet, but with you on\nthe team, they've gotta be tough.
Call it a hunch.
I feel like Toho Academy's gotten better since we\nplayed them in the National finals now that\nyou're on the team.
The way the game moved along... You look like\nfierce competition.
With you on the team, Hanawa MS is on a completely\ndifferent level than they were at Nationals.
But there's no way we're losing to you now!\nNot even in an exhibition!
Nankatsu is the team that won the Nationals three\nyears straight. Don't you forget it!
I plan to practice with better players!
That's where you're mistaken, Morisaki!
Good! Go for it!\nI'll stop everything you send my way!
You sure are confident! That's fine! Bring it on!\nI'll stop everything you send my way!
Hmm, maybe I spoke too soon...
But I do plan to play hard! So don't hold back!
Well, see ya. I'll be lookin' forward to it!


I think having you on board makes our already\nstrong Hirado MS team even stronger.

Gonna have to watch out.









There... we... go!
Oh, <avatar_name>? You're here early.\nDoing some morning practice?
What about you, Morisaki?
Wait, did I get the time wrong?!
Yeah, I can't exactly practice goalkeeping\nby myself, and I needta practice.
As the goalie of the championship team, I HAVE to\nget picked as a rep. I'd feel awful for all the\ngoalies we beat on the way if I don't.
Yeah, it's still a while until group training.\nYou aren't the careless type though, right?
But perfect timing though. Mind helping me train?
There's only so much a goalie can do on their own.\nBut with you here, there's all sorts of things we\ncan work on.
Alright, so how about you give me a few light\nkicks? Should make for a good warm-up.
Hyup! Yeah, just like that!
Looks like everyone's here now.\nTime to wrap this up then. Thanks, man.
Hmm... I kinda knew this already, but practicing\nwith you like this reminds me how good of a\nkicker you are.
I can see why you got picked. I'd better work hard\nif I don't want you getting that ball in my net\nand making me look bad.
Let's do this again sometime. I'm sure\npracticing shots with a real keeper is\nmore exciting for you too, right?
Anyway, group practice is about to start.\nKeep at it, buddy!
Alright, looking good! Thanks, <avatar_name>!
But man, your shot has gotten so much better\nin such a short time. I can tell.
As a third year, it's such a relief to know you'll\nbe here next year. I'm glad you're on the team.
It's like... I'm so lucky.\nI've got such great teammates.
Right in front of me, I've got Takasugi and\nIshizaki, both picked as outstanding defenders\nfor the tournament.
And on offense we've got the Izawa-Kisugi-Taki\ntrio, plus Tsubasa of course.
Putting myself in the shoes of the goalies of\nother teams that will have to face them\nmakes me shudder.
But you were chosen too, Morisaki.
Nankatsu is invincible! And you, too!
I-I guess...
I'm just happy all that effort I put in\nso we could win our threepeat paid off.
Ha ha! Invincible?
Well, you're right! What am I thinking? I'm the\ngoalie who took us to a threepeat, so I'd better\nact like it! Gotta do my keepers proud!
I had the help of my teammates, but I made sure\nthe opponents couldn't score more goals than us.
So we couldn't have done it without me, right?\nRight!
Thanks, <avatar_name>.\nI needed that shot of confidence.
I'll be Japan's number one goalie! Just watch me!
And then I'll become a rep and be the starting\nkeeper for the international team and...
Wait... But we can only have one goalie out.\nWhich means I'll have to compete with\nWakashimazu for the spot.
Plus... Nah. No way.
Sorry, just talking to myself. Forget it.
Okay <avatar_name>, let's both show this league\nwhat we've got!
We can get picked as reps together!



Okay, let's do this just like we did back\nat school!


Your shots are way better than the ones\nI saw back at school!
I didn't think I was slacking off,\nbut you've really been working overtime, bud!


I knew you were amazing.
I'll do my best not to lose, but it's entirely\npossible that you'll put more effort into it than\nI will.












Whoa, <avatar_name>! You always shoot so well!
I watched you carefully during the match earlier.\nYour play really impressed me.\nAre you seriously only a first-year?
I think Furano MS is even better now with you in\nit than when we played them before.
We haven't played Musashi MS yet, but with you on\nthe team, they've gotta be tough.
Call it a hunch.
I feel like Toho Academy's gotten better since we\nplayed them in the National finals now that\nyou're on the team.
The way the game moved along... You look like\nfierce competition.
I think you've gotten stronger since we played\nyou and Otomo MS in the Regional finals.
But there's no way we're losing to you now!\nNot even in an exhibition!
Nankatsu is the team that won the Nationals three\nyears straight. Don't you forget it!
I plan to practice with better players!
That's where you're mistaken, Morisaki!
Good! Go for it!\nI'll stop everything you send my way!
You sure are confident! That's fine! Bring it on!\nI'll stop everything you send my way!
Hmm, maybe I spoke too soon...
But I do plan to play hard! So don't hold back!
Well, see ya. I'll be lookin' forward to it!







Check these skills!
Tak!
There!
You're mine!
Take that!
Power up!
Got a package for ya!























Captain!
It's all you!
Do this for me!
Hidey-ho!
Drive it in!
Take it to 'em!
No turning back!

Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
That's nothin'... Even for me!
Woo! I did it!
I... I did it!
Nothing no sweet as a goal!
I'm not just a defender!
You see that?!
Heh, I did it!
Alright, we're catching up!
Let's bury 'em!
Defeat is not an option!
Scores are even!
Stay focused!
You only lose when ya give up!
Good work!
Stellar!
Keep it up!
Uh oh...!
No way!
Stop 'em!
Sweet!
Got it!
On it like a bee and honey!
Go!
Here!
This way!
I'm open!
Pass it!
End of the line!
We'll see about that!
Graaah!
I've been watching you play, Tsubasa!
F-Figures. You got me, Tsubasa!
You can't mock me, Hyuga!
As ridiculous as ever, Hyuga!
I've improved too, Misaki!
I knew you were good, Misaki!
I won't give up that easy, Matsuyama!
Yikes! Uh, nice, Matsuyama!
You can't mock me, Misugi!
Wh-Where'd you learn THAT, Misugi?!
Y'can't beat me, Masao!
Dang it! Of course, Masao's got moves...
Y'can't beat me, Kazuo!
Jeez! Shoulda expected that from Kazuo.
I won't lose that quick, Nitta!
Darn you, Nitta!
I got some muscle now, too, Jito!
Man! You're just too strong, Jito!
How dare you try to mock me, Soda!
Ugh! I won't lose next time, Soda!
I win, Ishizaki!
You've gotten good, Ishizaki!
I know all your moves, Izawa!
Guess you know all my moves, Izawa!
I know all your moves, Taki!
Guess you know all my moves, Taki!
Read you like a book, Kisugi!
Guess you read me like a book...
I'm just stubborn like that, Schneider!
S-So this is Schneider's real skill!
I've had enough of your nonsense, Heine!
Wh-What? What'd you just do?!
Don't underestimate me, Pierre!
I see why Misaki respects you, Pierre!
Check out my muscle, Jean!
So this is world-class, huh?
I win, Kluivoort!
Wh-What sharp movements, Kluivoort!
Pay attention, Rusciano!
S-So this is a fantasista!
I've improved too, Robson!
I'll catch up before you know it!
Today's my day, Carlos!
What did I expect? It's Carlos!
Not so fast, Diaz!
D-Darn you, Diaz!
This is my strength, Senghor!
Holy cow, Senghor! That technique!
How do you like them apples, Ryan!
How'd you know what I'd do before I did?
I'm no pushover, Blake!
A-Am I not strong enough?
No way I'm letting you do as you please!
Hey, nice one!
Oh, Takasugi from Nankatsu, right?
Um... Have we met?
Oh, you know me? Cool!
I'm Shingo Takasugi, from Nankatsu MS.\nNice to meet you.
And you were... wait, don't tell me,\nI've got this... <avatar_name>!
Sorry, I remembered you as that first-year\neveryone's talking about, so I forgot your\nname for a sec.
You've got some nice moves. I mean, that's no\nsurprise since you made regular at Furano MS.
You've got some nice moves. I mean, that's no\nsurprise since you made regular at Musashi MS.
You've got some nice moves. I mean, that's no\nsurprise since you made regular at Toho Academy.
Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing\nyou in a match next time.
I've got a feeling that you're going to be\nmaking a big splash soon. Good luck!
Nice work, <avatar_name>.
Actually, I've been watching you guys practice,\nand something's really bugging me.
You keep stopping to check your phone, don't you?\nI gotta say, that's not cool.
You've been doing okay in your matches lately,\nbut you've really got to stay focused in practice.
I'm checking out my next opponents.
I'm studying videos of my opponents.
Oh? Really? My bad.
Wow, that's pretty committed.\nI could learn from you.
Oh? Really? My bad.
So you're working out strategies in your head\nor something? I should try that, too...
Oh yeah, like I said,\nI got to see your match the other day.
You're pretty good. Like, I wouldn't even\nbe surprised if you got picked as a rep,\nwhich itself is impressive.
Plus, I can tell how much better\nFurano MS is doing with you there.
Plus, I can tell how much better\nMusashi MS is doing with you there.
Plus, I can tell how much better\nToho Academy is doing with you there.
But next match will be different.\nWe won't let you run all over us.
But it'll be different once you're up against\nNankatsu. We won't let you run all over us.
Research us all you like.\nIt'll be funner that way.
It's gonna be so much fun!
Not bad at all! That's a heck of a header.
You've really been pulling out all the stops\nlately. As your teammate, it makes me want to work\nharder, too.
Come to think of it, we've never\nreally talked much, have we?
I'm Shingo Takasugi.\nNice to meet you, <avatar_name>! Again.
As clean as ever, <avatar_name>!
I'd better step it up, too,\nif I don't want to fall behind!
Looking good, <avatar_name>! You're as good\nin practice as you are in your matches!
To be honest, you've had an influence on me, too.\nEver since we talked, I've been studying videos\nof my opponents, too.
I know I hafta step up, too,\nif I don't want to fall behind!
I know, how about we practice together? You\ncan pick what we're doing. I'll just tag along.
I want to try a battle of technique.
I want to try a battle of strength.
Oh, uhhh... That's not exactly my specialty...
No, I guess that's all the\nmore reason to train it.
Okay, you're on!
Alright! That's what I'm good for!
I love competing! Okay, bring it on!
Phew, what a workout.
But we can't just settle for that, now can we?\nI mean, we're up against the world.\nWe need to be better.
But no matter who we're up against,\nI think I'll have fun as long as you're there.\nI just hope I can help out!
Man, we got some great training in today!
Seriously. My uniform's soaked in sweat.
And... there we go.
Hey guys, I brought towels! Wipe off\nall that sweat. You stink to high heaven!
Someone's on the ball! Thanks, man!
Great work, <avatar_name>!
You really stand out in both\ntraining and in matches!
Here, have a towel.\nWipe yourself off before you catch a cold.
Thank you!
Is this really a job for a player?
No prob.
I mean, wouldn't it suck if we lost our\nshot at number one because we got sick?
Does it matter who gets the towels? I saw we\ndidn't have towels so I went and got them. No big.
Besides, wouldn't it suck if we lost our\nshot at number one because we got sick?
As reps, taking care of our\nhealth is super important!
Phew, I'm beat.
Put your towels in the basket when you're done\nguys! I'll take them to the laundry room!
Nah, we can take care of that.
You've gotta clean yourself up and get changed,\ntoo, right Takasugi? Or you'll be late for dinner!
Oh, thanks!
Hey <avatar_name>.\nYou've been doing amazing lately!
I want to follow your lead!
Could you watch me in practice today?
Outta the way!
Łoł!
Ugh! I'm one of Japan's defenders, too!\nYou won't get past me EVERY time!
Wh-What?
This is the power of our defense, Hyuga!
Takasugi's really getting into this.\nIs that your influence, <avatar_name>?
The gentle giant was so fierce just now!
He even sent Hyuga flying!
You should've seen him back at the finals this\nsummer. He almost started a brawl with Hyuga.
I mean, he's had a lot of chances to go up\nagainst Hyuga since elementary school.\nHe's pretty used to it by now.
Anyway, Takasugi's definitely gentle off the\nfield, but both off and on the field he's always\nwatching over everyone.
Like, when I hurt my foot back in our match with\nAzumaichi, Takasugi's the only one who noticed.
He really does change when he's playing. He has\nenough fight in him to take on even Jito or Hyuga.
Did you see me, <avatar_name>?
Thanks to you, I was able to take my play to\nthe next level! I really put my heart into it!
Perfect timing. We were just talking about\nhow passionate you are about soccer!
Heh... Stop embarrassing me!
I'm just doing what I can.
Let's keep on supporting everyone together,\n<avatar_name>!
There!
Hmm... The range is okay,\nbut it could use more control...
Oh, if it isn't <avatar_name>!
What're you doing out so late?
That's an unusual play to practice...
Can't you tell? I'm practicing throw-ins.\nLong throws, too.
Not really.
I mean, I guess throw-ins aren't something you do\nall the time, but they're important when they come\nup.
Always best to be ready.
Oh, I know. I could teach you a trick\nif you like. Want to give it a shot?
Sometimes the throw-in is the key to the match,\nlike when we were up against Hirado MS in\nNationals. It can't hurt anyway!
There, head to the goal!
Hey, don't you think Takasugi's throw-ins\nare going further than before?
Yeah, it's crazy...
I know I got the muscles for it,\nbut I sure can't throw like that!
Don't you think my long throw has gotten\na lot better than before, <avatar_name>?
Actually, I learned a trick from\nan American player.
You know about American football, right?\nI figured one of the Americans might have a tip\nfor me that'd be something different.
And when I went and asked, turns out I was right!\nHe was even nice enough to teach me!
We can't miss this chance to talk to\npeople from all over the world!
I know! I'll teach you the technique, too.\nAn American-style long throw!
We'll show the world that throw-ins matter!
Hey, nice one!
Oh, Takasugi from Nankatsu, right?
Um... Have we met?
Oh, you know me? Cool!
I'm Shingo Takasugi, from Nankatsu MS.\nNice to meet you.
And you were... wait, don't tell me,\nI've got this... <avatar_name>!
Sorry, I remembered you as that first-year\neveryone's talking about, so I forgot your\nname for a sec.
You've got some nice moves. I mean, that's no\nsurprise since you made regular at Furano MS.
You've got some nice moves. I mean, that's no\nsurprise since you made regular at Musashi MS.
You've got some nice moves. I mean, that's no\nsurprise since you made regular at Toho Academy.
Those movements are top notch. Looks like the\nTachibana Bros weren't the only skilled younger\nplayers in Hanawa MS.
Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing\nyou in a match next time.
I've got a feeling that you're going to be\nmaking a big splash soon. Good luck!
Nice work, <avatar_name>.
Actually, I've been watching you guys practice,\nand something's really bugging me.
You keep stopping to check your phone, don't you?\nI gotta say, that's not cool.
You've been doing okay in your matches lately,\nbut you've really got to stay focused in practice.
I'm checking out my next opponents.
I'm studying videos of my opponents.
Oh? Really? My bad.
Wow, that's pretty committed.\nI could learn from you.
Oh? Really? My bad.
So you're working out strategies in your head\nor something? I should try that, too...
Oh yeah, like I said,\nI got to see your match the other day.
The way you were playing, I wouldn't even\nbe surprised if you got picked as a rep.\nIt was impressive.
Plus, I can tell how much better\nFurano MS is doing with you there.
Plus, I can tell how much better\nMusashi MS is doing with you there.
Plus, I can tell how much better\nToho Academy is doing with you there.
I can tell how much better Hanawa's doing.\nYeah, the Tachibana Bros are there...\nBut you're making a difference, too.
But next match will be different.\nWe won't let you run all over us.
But it'll be different once you're up against\nNankatsu. We won't let you run all over us.
Research us all you like.\nIt'll be more fun that way.
It's gonna be so much fun!







Those movements are top notch. Looks like we have\nanother player hand can move as well Sano can.














What's more, Jito and Sano aren't the only ones\ncarrying the team. You're really making a name for\nyourself out there.




Hey, got a minute?
Maybe it's just my imagination,\nbut was your leg hurt in practice today?
You've got a good eye.
It doesn't hurt that much...
I wouldn't go that far. It was a bit obvious.
Anyway, even a small injury could be worse than\nyou think, so let's head on over to the infirmary,\nokay?
Hmm... Better safe than sorry though, right?\nLet's head on over to the infirmary, just in case.
Whew, I'm glad it was just a little inflamed.\nStick a compress on that, and you'll be fine.
You wanna know how I noticed?
I've got a good view of the field from my\nposition, so I like to keep on eye on how\neveryone's moving.
So I could tell that you were acting a little\ndifferent. Like... you weren't putting any\nstrength into your pivot leg, so I got worried.
I mean, you're gonna be our future ace,\nafter all. We have to keep you safe and sound.
Head home for today and get some rest. And don't\nforget to change the compress every so often!
Yo, <avatar_name>! Staying late for practice again?
Wait, are you just messing around on your phone?\nAnd here I thought you were one of the serious\nones.
No, this is a video of today's training.
You don't watch these, Takasugi?
Whoa, we record that? I never even noticed.
Now, I'm curious... Mind if I take a look?
Wait, you're gonna show it to me?
Is this a video of us playing today?\nWhen did you take this?
Can I watch, too?
Wow, this is good. The way that played out\nwas almost like a real match.
But if you record it like this you can't see\nyourself, so you can't look over your own plays,\nright?
Oh, I know! I'll take a video of you right now!
Well, it'll just be you practicing by yourself,\nbut it's better than nothing, right?
So how is it? I thought it came out pretty good.
Whew, I'm glad you like it.
I never knew you were so into studying plays\nlike this.
Is that how you've improved so fast?\nStudying both on and off the field?
I mean, I get it. You're so eager to learn\neverything you can from everyone around you.
Heck, maybe I should learn from YOU\nand start studying everyone else more.
I'm not letting you outstrip me. As Nankatsu's\nwall, I'd rather be a rock for you to stand on.
With that in mind, let's get some more training\nin! Then we'll head back, eat dinner, and crash!
I mean, sleep is just as important for both\npractice and studying. You'll never improve\nif you wreck your body in the process.

I've been thinking this ever since I saw you\nplay back at school, but you're really crazy\nabout training, aren't you?
I gotta say, as your teammate,\nit really pushes me to work harder, too!
Looks like you're in perfect health today,\n<avatar_name>!
I've gotta work harder too,\nif I don't want to fall behind!
Looking good, <avatar_name>! You're as good\nin practice as you are in your matches!
To be honest, you've had an influence on me, too.\nEver since we talked, I've been taking videos\nof everyone and studying them, too!












Hey, nice one!
Oh, Takasugi from Nankatsu, right?
Um... Have we met?
Oh, you know me? Cool!
I'm Shingo Takasugi, from Nankatsu MS.\nNice to meet you.
And you were... wait, don't tell me,\nI've got this... <avatar_name>!
Sorry, I remembered you as that first-year\neveryone's talking about, so I forgot your\nname for a sec.
You've got some nice moves. I mean, that's no\nsurprise since you made regular at Furano MS.
You've got some nice moves. I mean, that's no\nsurprise since you made regular at Musashi MS.
You've got some nice moves. I mean, that's no\nsurprise since you made regular at Toho Academy.
And those movements are top notch.\nOtomo MS really does have some good young guys.
Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing\nyou in a match next time.
I've got a feeling that you're going to be\nmaking a big splash soon. Good luck!
Nice work, <avatar_name>.
Actually, I've been watching you guys practice,\nand something's really bugging me.
You keep stopping to check your phone, don't you?\nI gotta say, that's not cool.
You've been doing okay in your matches lately,\nbut you've really got to stay focused in practice.
I'm checking out my next opponents.
I'm studying videos of my opponents.
Oh? Really? My bad.
Wow, that's pretty committed.\nI could learn from you.
Oh? Really? My bad.
So you're working out strategies in your head\nor something? I should try that, too...
Oh yeah, like I said,\nI got to see your match the other day.
The way you were playing, I wouldn't even\nbe surprised if you got picked as a rep.\nIt was impressive.
Plus, I can tell how much better\nFurano MS is doing with you there.
Plus, I can tell how much better\nMusashi MS is doing with you there.
Plus, I can tell how much better\nToho Academy is doing with you there.
I can tell how much better Otomo's doing. Yeah,\nthere's Urabe and his guys, Nitta's a beast...\nBut you're making a difference, too.
But next match will be different.\nWe won't let you run all over us.
But it'll be different once you're up against\nNankatsu. We won't let you run all over us.
Research us all you like.\nIt'll be more fun that way.
It's gonna be so much fun!







I'm on fire!
I'm fired up!
That's it!
Ba-da-boom!
Check these moves!
Go!
Run in!

You guys see that?
I'm pretty good at shooting, too!
Okay! Let's get out ahead!
Time to leave 'em in the dust!
No way we're losing!
Chill out! We're still just tied!
Don't let your guard down!
It's not over yet!
That's the stuff!
Nice!
Keep it up!
Oh boy...!
How...?!
Get 'em!
Nice pass!
Thanks!
I've got this!
Here I go!
I'm open!
Over here!
C'mon! Here!
Pass to me!
Check this out!
Can't beat me!
I'm on fire today!
It's 'cause I've seen you up close!
Nice! But there's always next time!
Don't underestimate me, Hyuga!
How'd you get so strong, Hyuga?
I know a thing or two, too, Misaki!
Ugh! You're just too good, Misaki!
See how strong I am, Matsuyama?
I knew you were good, Matsuyama!
I won't hold back, Misugi!
You... You got me good, Misugi!
I can battle off the ground, too!
He beat me outta the air?!
You've got a ways to go, Nitta!
Look at you go, Nitta!
You're not better than me, Jito!
Ugh! Your strength is amazing, Jito!
You took me lightly, Soda!
Dang, Soda, you're as sharp as a tack!
I'm not losing to you, Ishizaki!
Since when were you this good, Ishizaki?
I win, Takasugi!
Nice moves, Takasugi!
I win, Taki!
Nice moves, Taki!
Got'cha beat, Kisugi!
You've gotten good, Kisugi!
How do you like that, Schneider?
I see why Wakabayashi respects you!
You got complacent, Heine!
So you really are that good, Heine!
You won't beat me in technique, Pierre!
I see why Misaki respects you!
Don't take me lightly, Jean!
Darn you, Jean!
I win, Kluivoort!
Łoł! You're strong!
I've gotten better, haven't I, Klismann?
I knew you'd be good, Klismann!
Don't underestimate me, Rusciano!
Guess you're not all talk!
I win, Carlos!
Just what I'd expect from Brazil's ace!
I've got my own pride, Diaz!
No! He got me!
You won't beat me in technique, Senghor!
You're pretty good, Senghor!
I've got my own pride, Ryan!
You read all my moves perfectly!
You won't beat me with brute force!
That much strength is just unfair!
How long are you gonna look down on us?!
I'm the best at heading there is!
Um... Who were you again?
You're <avatar_name>, right?\nThe first-year from Furano? I saw your match.
You're <avatar_name>, right?\nThe first-year from Musashi? I saw your match.
You're <avatar_name>, right? The first-year\nfrom Toho Academy? I saw your match.
Oh... So, you need something?
I'm here to challenge you, Izawa!
I'm here to test my skills!
Where's this coming from?
But sure, why not? Sounds fun. I accept.
Measuring yourself against me? Cheeky, aren't you?
But sure. I'll show you the difference between us.
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
You've got a ways to go before\nyou can take me on, kid.
But I'll admit it takes guts to challenge\na stranger out of nowhere.\nYou're an interesting guy.
Your name was <avatar_name>, right?\nI won't be forgetting you anytime soon.
Come back whenever you're more confident!
Yo, <avatar_name>! Back already?\nThink you've improved a little?
Alright, then let's get right to it!
Bring it on!
Whoa... You're getting there.\nI couldn't steal the ball this time.
Bring it on!
Whoa... You're getting there.\nI couldn't slip past you this time.
But this is just practice.\nIt'll be different in a real game.
Don't expect it to go that easy\nwhen the pressure is on!
I still have a lot to learn from you.
That's just my fighting style.
Huh. I called you cheeky earlier,\nbut you're pretty humble, aren't you?\nThat doesn't mean I'll go easy on you, though.
Heh. You sure talk big anyway. Interesting.
Well, we'll see when we get a match.
Either way, you're clearly better\nthan you were last time.
I'm looking forward to the\nnext time you challenge me!
You've really been working hard lately,\nhuh <avatar_name>?
We haven't really talked much, have we?
It's a little late, but grats on\nmaking it onto the team with us!
Yo <avatar_name>! Hard at work, huh?
You haven't stopped by in a while.\nI've been waiting for you, y'know.
Well, now that we're on the same team I guess\nyou can challenge me whenever you like, huh?
Anyway, grats on making it onto the team!
Yo <avatar_name>! Hard at work, eh?
You've really improved since you last challenged\nme! I couldn't ask for a better teammate!
Anyway, grats on making it onto the team!
Right, same to you!
You're a perfect rival, Izawa!
Let's both work hard and push\nthis team forward together!
Both teammates and rivals...\nSounds perfect for this kind of team.
It'll be great! Let's keep on competing as\nteammates, and push this team forward together!
Yo, <avatar_name>. You've been doing\npretty well for yourself lately.
...
Hey, do you mind coming with me\nto practice defense tonight?
Defense? You?
Sure thing.
I've had a lot on my mind. C'mon, please?
Thanks, man. I'll see you then.
C'mon, bring it!
Ugh... You've sure gotten good!
I need to polish up my defense, too!
Okay, time to try out those tricks you taught me.\nCome at me!
Ugh... This is tough!
Thanks for training with me today, <avatar_name>.
...
This team's got way too many good midfielders.
Obviously, you've got Tsubasa, Misaki, and Misugi,\nbut then there's Sawada, Masao and Kazuo...\nand even Sano swapping in from forward.
And you, too, of course.
Sheesh, it's crazy.
I've always been a midfielder. I'm super confident\nin my aerial game, and I think I can keep up with\npassing, dribbling, and shooting, too.
So if I can shore up my skills on defense,\nI'll be able to manage both offense and defense.
If I could play in any position, I'd be someone\nwho could really help out this team. I hope.
Whoops, I just started rambling there.\nTime to get back to practice!
...
Here I come!
Not on my watch!
Uwaaah!
Sorry, Takasugi. You okay?
Y-Yeah, I'm fine.\nIt's just my ankle feels a little... OWWW!
You need to see a doctor right away, Takasugi.
O-Okay.
Now, who can swap in...?
It's my time to shine!
Izawa, you're up.
Y-Yessir!
Hey! Coach, why're we switching\nin Izawa for a defender?!
Izawa, you've been working on defensive skills\non your own time for a while now.\nWell, here's your chance to try it out for real.
Thank you, Coach!
I'd no idea he was working so hard...
Break a leg, Izawa!
Got it!
What's wrong, <avatar_name>?
I'm so glad we practiced defense!
I guess the coach saw us.
Tak! Thanks for going through\nall that trouble, too!
But I had no idea the coach was watching us.\nThat was a big shock.
Seriously, when did that happen? I had no idea.
Well, Takasugi's ankle turned out okay, and I got\nto show off my hard work, so today was a win-win!
Next year, after I graduate, I'm planning\non playing for Nankatsu high school.
And it's not just me. There'll also be Taki and\nKisugi and Takasugi and Morisaki and... Well,\nmaybe Ishizaki, too, if he doesn't flunk out.
Anyway, lots of people are saying they aren't\nexpecting as much from Nankatsu High since Tsubasa\nwon't be there, but I'll show 'em.
I mean, we're here right now aren't we? Learning\nfrom him and the other world-class players... I'll\nshow them how much I've grown as a midfielder!
I'll be a player who can really use\nour training together, <avatar_name>!
Now, let's go take on the world!
Ha!
You think I'd lose to that?!
You sure are good at aerial clashes, Izawa.\nI mean, I'm no slouch at headers either...
My air game is an especially special specialty!
Please, teach me your wisdom!
I wouldn't lose to you!
Hmm... I don't mind, but let's\nsee how good you are first.
Them's fightin' words.
Okay, let's settle this, you and me!
Not a bad header, <avatar_name>.\nYou might have a knack for this.
Okay, I'll teach you the trick to aerial clashes.
These come up a lot whether you're on offense\nor defense, so I'm sure it'll come in handy.
Here I come, <avatar_name>!
You've really got this down!
That was a pretty good clash, you two.
Hey, Wakabayashi.
But since we've got all these players from\ndifferent countries here, how about you go see how\nthey do things, too? Maybe you'll learn something.
Like, say, from Germany's Margus. From what\nI've seen, he's one of the best at headers.
Huh? You already know him, <avatar_name>?
That's perfect then.\nWhy don't you go talk to him together?
Sounds great! Lead the way, <avatar_name>!
I'm not too close to him either, but he seems\npretty laid back so why don't you try talking to\nhim?
Sounds like a plan! Let's go, <avatar_name>!
Hey there, <avatar_name>.
Hmm? Who's that with you?
I'm Mamoru Izawa. Nice to meet you.
Oh, I'm Manfred Margus. The pleasure's all mine!
So, what can I do for ya?
Hmm? You look like Japanese players,\nbut did you need something?
Yeah. Do you know our goalie Wakabayashi?
Sure. The Japanese guy from Hamburg, right?\nOf course I know him. I've lost count of how\nmany times we've played each other.
Great. So anyway, we heard from him that there\nwas a German player who's amazing at headers.
Wakabayashi said that?\nAww, I didn't know he cared.
Actually, I'm pretty proud of my air game, too, so\nI though I could ask you for some tips. You know,\nget an outside perspective from another country.
Oh, I get you. Sure, why not?
Huh? Really?
Hey, I'm not going to just turn away a couple of\nfriendly players who asked me for pointers just\nbecause they represent another country.
Plus, it's not like I'm hiding anything.
Thanks!
Now where to start... From before the jump,\nI guess. That's where it all begins, after all.\nThe thing is...
Wow... I never realized there were\ntechniques like that.
Ja. With this, you should come out on top even\nif your opponent is a little more athletic.
I really appreciate all this, Margus!\nNow, I wanna get back and try it out ASAP!
Good luck, you two! Tschüss!
Man, I can't believe how much that paid off!\nWe really have a lot to learn from all these\ninternational players!
Now, let's get back to the field\nand start practicing it!
And then we'll dominate the air worldwide!
Um... Who were you again?
You're <avatar_name>, right?\nThe first-year from Furano? I saw your match.
You're <avatar_name>, right?\nThe first-year from Musashi? I saw your match.
You're <avatar_name>, right?\nThe first-year from Toho Academy? I saw your match.
You're <avatar_name>, right?\nThe first-year from Hanawa? I saw your match.
Oh... So, you need something?
I'm here to challenge you, Izawa!
I'm here to test my skills!
Where's this coming from?
But sure, why not? Sounds fun. I accept.
Measuring yourself against me? Cheeky, aren't you?
But sure. I'll show you the difference between us.
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
You've got a ways to go before\nyou can take me on, kid.
But I'll admit it takes guts to challenge\na stranger out of nowhere.\nYou're an interesting guy.
Your name was <avatar_name>, right?\nI won't be forgetting you anytime soon.
Come back whenever you're more confident!

You're <avatar_name>, right?\nThe first-year from Hirado? I saw your match.













Hyah! You're up, Taki!
Got it! Nice pass!
You're not getting past me!
We'll see about that!
Alright!
Seriously?
It's all yours, Izawa!
Okay, now's my chance!
Gah! I'll be ready next time!
Hey, <avatar_name>. Need something?
You want me to teach you some stuff?
I don't mind, but why me?
Without Tsubasa, you're the core player.
You seem like you have the most plays.
Ha ha, it's nice to hear that.
Just so you know, I've been playing midfield\neven longer than Tsubasa. So with him gone,\nI was a pretty obvious choice.
I wouldn't say I'm as good as him, but I can\ndefinitely play on a national level, too.
Well, that's because I used to play midfield.
Maybe I can't compare to Tsubasa, but I try to\nstay good at everything, whether it's dribbling,\npassing, shooting, you name it.
Anyway, I'd love to teach you, but it'd be easier\nif you narrowed down what exactly you want to\nwork on first.
Oops, look at the time.\nSorry, but I've got plans after this.
In the meantime, try to figure out precisely what\nyou think we should work on! Ask me anytime!
Later!
So since you're asking me to stay behind,\nI'm assuming you've got a clearer idea now?
I want to be an all-around player, too.
I want to be seen as a balanced player.
You really look up to me that much?
But if that's really what you want,\nI'll help you as best I can.
I see. Makes sense that you'd come to me,\ninstead of Taki or Kisugi then.
Okay, let's give it a shot.
First of all, you need to have the basics down\npat. Those're the building blocks for everything.
No, your dribble needs more...
Good. When passing you need to...
Whoops, it's already pitch black out here.
No, it's fine, seeing you try so hard\nis what makes teaching you worth it.
As someone who shows such dedication, I'm sure you\nalready know this, but no matter what anyone says,\nNankatsu isn't just Tsubasa.
Sure, we relied on him a lot during the tournament,\nbut each and every one of us is a skilled player,\nwho brings something to the table.
Like how in the semifinals with Furano,\nI took over playmaking for Tsubasa,\nand I don't think we would've won without it.
We're all too aware of the gap between him and us,\nbut we've all played our part.\nTsubasa led us here.
Now, I'm not telling you to be him, but when\nyou're the core of your team, I want you to be a\nplayer who brings out the best in your teammates.
And I'll do whatever I can to help you achieve\nthat. We've gotta think about Nankatsu's fourth\nand fifth consecutive wins, right?
Well, that's enough for today.\nWe'll continue this some other time.
There's still plenty to learn. And you can't just\nfocus on your own play, you need to be able to\nwatch the whole field and make quick judgments.
Anyway, we'll be starting early tomorrow,\nso we'd better hit the hay.

Oh yeah, we haven't really talked\nsince we became reps, have we?



But I've been watching you awhile, so I'm ready\nto give you advice on anything you need.
Anyway, 'grats on making it onto the team!
Hey <avatar_name>. Working hard as usual!
Looks like you've gotten a lot better,\nin both your skills and your judgment.\nYou're really reliable these days!



Let's both work hard and push\nthis team forward together!

It'll be great! Let's keep on competing as\nteammates, and push this team forward together!
Um... Who were you again?
You're <avatar_name>, right?\nThe first-year from Furano? I saw your match.
You're <avatar_name>, right?\nThe first-year from Musashi? I saw your match.
You're <avatar_name>, right? The first-year\nfrom Toho Academy? I saw your match.
You're <avatar_name>, right?\nThe first-year from Otomo? I saw your match.
Oh... So, you need something?
I'm here to challenge you, Izawa!
I'm here to test my skills!
Where's this coming from?
But sure, why not? Sounds fun. I accept.
Measuring yourself against me? Cheeky, aren't you?
But sure. I'll show you the difference between us.
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
You've got a ways to go before\nyou can take me on, kid.
But I'll admit it takes guts to challenge\na stranger out of nowhere.\nYou're an interesting guy.
Your name was <avatar_name>, right?\nI won't be forgetting you anytime soon.
Come back whenever you're more confident!







Haaah!
Gyah!
That's it!
There's the stuff!
Have some gristle!
Go!
Party time!

Blake!
Azwan!
I did it! That's so awesome!
I'll always be a scoring midfielder!
One step closer to Tsubasa!
Wow! That went well!
I'm doing my best, too!
Excellent! It went in!
We have to win this match!
Things're looking up! Let's get ahead!
At this rate, we can't lose!
Let's turn it around in one go!
Please, calm down! We're still tied!
Let's get another one!
No choice but to keep up the pressure!
Stellar work!
Awesome!
Delicious!
Oh, boy...!
No way!
Set 'em up! Knock 'em down!
Awesome pass!
Got it!
Trust me!
Go!
Hey!
Hey, over here!
I'm open!
Get me that ball!
I'm giving 100%!
I'll make it through!
Here I go!
Time for a Twin Shot!
C'mon, Hyuga!
This is our weapon!
I-I did it! I beat Tsubasa!
I'll catch up with you someday, Tsubasa!
I know you best, Hyuga!
You'll see me in a new light someday!
I've improved too, Misaki!
Only you could be so skilled, Misaki!
I've been doing my best, too, Matsuyama!
Ugh. Still doesn't work on you, huh?
I-I beat Misugi?!
Ugh. I'll surpass you someday, Misugi!
My technique is better, Masao!
Ack! Smooth moves, Masao!
Your technique can't compete, Kazuo!
Man! Nice moves, Kazuo!
Time to pay you back for Nankatsu SC!
Ugh. I still can't beat Nitta?!
Hyuga's even stronger than you, Jito!
Wow, you're massive, Jito!
I won't be done in that easily, Soda!
Wow... Your play is like a knife, Soda!
Don't be a fool, Ishizaki!
I can really tell you're from Nankatsu.
I know all your plays, Sorimachi!
Oof! You move really well, Sorimachi!
Never think little of me, Sawaki!
You're definitely a Meiwa FC veteran!
I-I can keep up, too, Schneider!
Oof! I guess I'm still no match for him.
Don't make fun of me, Heine!
A-Am I just no match for Heine?
Check out my technique, Pierre!
Oh jeez, that difference in skill level.
You won't get me that easy, Jean!
Ugh! I'll get you next time, Jean!
I can deal with you, too, Kluivoort!
So this is a world-class player...
You'll lose if you underestimate me!
Oof! Your skills are amazing!
Not even Carlos can overlook me!
I'd better study these Brazilian skills!
Even I can beat a careless prodigy!
W-Wow... But someday that'll be me!
I'm not going to lose to you, Senghor!
Oof! That's some technique, Senghor!
You underestimated me, Ryan!
I can't believe we're the same age.
Just brute force doesn't scare me!
You might even be stronger than Hyuga!
I'm a scoring midfielder like Tsubasa!
Those're the eyes of a fighter!
Something's off about you today, Hyuga!
This isn't Meiwa's style at all!
You were moving really well out there,\n<avatar_name>!
Keep up the good work!
You know it!
Let's do our best out there!
Way to be, <avatar_name>!\nYou've still got a lot of room for growth!
While I joined first and, in that sense, I'm your\nsenior...
Since I was in elementary school,\nI've often played with students older than me.\nIt made me better like it makes you better.
I got used to it.
But I have to admit, it's nice having someone\nfrom the same grade here with me.
The Junior Hero League has only just begun.
The path ahead is long, so we'll have to put our\nbest foot forward.
We've made it halfway through the Junior Hero\nLeague, but there are still many formidable\nmatchups ahead.
Let's do everything we can to come out on top!
The Junior Hero League match against Nankatsu is\ncoming up.
Let's do our best to make Nankatsu regret coming\nonto the field to face us!
Let's do this, <avatar_name>!
Alright! We've got three wins and two losses!\nToday's victory belongs to me!
Alright! We've got three wins and two losses!\nToday's victory belongs to me!
Whether it's a match or practice, there's never a\ndull moment with you around, <avatar_name>.
The third year students will all be leaving once\nthe Junior Hero League is over.
It's kind of strange to say this, but I think\nit'll be up to me to carry the team from now on.
I feel that I'm prepared for it... But I'd be\nlying if I said I didn't have any worries.
It's one thing to lose Hyuga, but Wakashimazu and\nSorimachi also leave big shoes to fill. I don't\nknow if I'm enough to make up for their loss.
But I'm glad to have you with me at least.
Having teammates who try as hard as I do is\nextremely reassuring.
I feel the same way.
I see you as a rival.
<avatar_name>...
Yeah, let's work together to assure Toho's second\nvictory in Nationals!
Right. When it comes to improving the skills of\nthe Toho Academy soccer team, us and the rest of\nour teammates are all rivals.
But that's also the common bond between us. Let's\nall improve our skills and make the Toho Academy\nsoccer team better than ever!
But before that, the completion of the league\nmatches will signal the start of the\nInternational Tournament.
If we all do our very best, there's a chance\nwe'll be chosen to represent Japan.
Let's do everything in our power to win all the\nleague matches and be chosen to represent Japan!
Oh, it's you!
<avatar_name> from Furano MS.
<avatar_name> from Musashi MS.
<avatar_name> from Furano MS.\nI remember your play from our last match!
<avatar_name> from Musashi MS.\nI remember your play from our last match!
I've been interested in you ever since I heard\nyou were in the same grade as me.
I'm Takeshi Sawada from Toho Academy.\nNice to meet you!
Nice to meet you, too!
The same grade... That makes us rivals.
Even though we're from different schools, it'd be\nnice if we could be friends, seeing that we're in\nthe same grade and all.
Rivals... I suppose you're right. There aren't a\nlot of first-year students in the league matches.
Let's do our best to improve our skills as two\nstudents in the same grade!
I'm looking forward to facing off against a\nfellow first-year student!
Let's fight hard in the matches to come!
Well then, catch ya later!
Gotcha!
If you're gonna play like that, you might as well\nretire now, <avatar_name>.
When you step on the field, you'll be surrounded\nby opponents who will attack from every angle\nimaginable.
It reminds me of something Hyuga told me a long\ntime ago. It was my third year of elementary\nschool, back before joining Meiwa FC.
Well, during practice, your teammates suddenly\nbecome like enemies, and they can't be allowed to\nget the ball off you.
So I think there is merit in practicing with a\nchip on your shoulder.
I'm pretty sure that's the gist of what Hyuga\ntaught me.
But anyway, that's not why I'm here. I'm up to a\nbit of mischief.
I've seen how well you've been playing lately,\n<avatar_name>.
But I'm not about to lose to a fellow first-year!\nThat's why I came here to challenge you! Will you\naccept my challenge?
I'm the best first-year!
Bring it on!
We'll just see about that!\nI'm proud of the fact that I'm one of the core\nplayers of the team that won the Nationals!
Alright! Let's play!
I'm comin' for ya!
Ugh! Two wins and three losses!\nYou win this round!
Ugh! Two wins and three losses!\nYou win this round!
How frustrating...\nBut at least it was a good showdown!
I may have lost today, but I won't lose out on\nthe field. I'll beat you and lead my team to\nvictory!
Alright, then. Let's meet again in the stadium!
The next time we meet might be as reps! Let's do\nour best to be chosen!
See you around!
<avatar_name>!
We haven't been able to talk as much since you\nmade the first team at school...
But you're a really talented player. You couldn't\nbe satisfied as a Toho Academy regular? Now,\nyou're also playing games as a national rep!
We haven't been able to talk as much at school,\nbut you're a really talented player.
You couldn't be satisfied as a Toho Academy\nregular? Now, you're also playing games as a\nnational rep!
You managed to win the Junior Hero League and be\nchosen as a rep!
During the Junior Hero League, I knew there was a\nplayer the same age as me but didn't pay it much\nmind.
But you surprised me when we played as reps.\nI couldn't believe how good you were!
When we faced off against each other in the\nJunior Hero League, my only impression of you was\nthat you were a good passer.
But you surprised me when we played as reps.\nI couldn't believe how good you were!
During the Junior Hero League, I just thought of\nyou as a player who was the same age as me.
But you surprised me when we played as reps.\nI couldn't believe how good you were!
Since the Junior Hero League, I've been\nconstantly reminded of just how great a player\nyou've become.
And I was surprised all over again when we played\nas reps. I couldn't believe how good you were!
That rep uniform looks good on you!
It looks good on you, too, Takeshi.
It was my dream to wear this.
Th-Thanks! I'm glad to hear it.
Me, too!\nI've been admiring reps since elementary school!
But just wearing these uniforms isn't enough.
I don't want to drudge up bad memories from the\nscrims... But all of the world's teams are quite\nformidable. We can't let our guard down.
Still, our goal is to be best in the world!\nLet's focus on making that dream a reality!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
There, Nitta!
Nice pass!
Alright!
Hyuga, every time I see a practice or a match,\nI'm reminded of the gap between me and Tsubasa.
...
During the scrims against America and Germany,\nwhen we were without Tsubasa, I played in the\nmatches but was unable to get anything done.
I can still feel the shock from those matches\neven now...
And at the summer Nationals, I had been so\nconfident in my abilities that I felt I could\nhold my own against Tsubasa.
Now, I know that I still have a long way to go...
...
You're really something, <avatar_name>.\nYou play on par with Tsubasa.
And because of that, I...
You can't have that attitude!
Maybe you need to try harder?
<avatar_name>!
<avatar_name>!
<avatar_name>...
(Hmph...)
Hyuga, is Takeshi okay?\nSomething really seems to be bothering him.
Leave him be.
Huh?
It's not our place to interfere.\nWe should keep quiet and watch.
...?
(<avatar_name>...)
Everyone, use the sides more!\nAnd meet me in the center!
Racja! I'm on it!
There, Pascal! One-two!
Alright, Diaz! Do it!
Nobody can stand in my way!
Bossis you're not moving enough! At this rate, me\nand Napoleon will continue to be marked!
G-Got it, Pierre!
Hey, <avatar_name>.\nWeren't you going to practice somewhere?
Weren't you, Takeshi?
We've been watching together.
Well, umm, I've been watching the practices of\nvarious countries.
Huh?! I didn't even realize you were there...
But that's on you. You could at least have said\nsomething... Not that it really matters.
I realized something after what you said earlier.\nYou've been practicing as hard as you can to keep\nup with Tsubasa.
And even though I've seen it, I don't know how I\ncould have been so naive...
I need to not get down on myself over our gap in\nabilities and do whatever it takes to close the\ngap.
So I've decided to do anything in my power to\ncatch up to Tsubasa.
That's why I've been observing the world's teams\nand studying how they practice and play.
But that being said, each team's style is\ncompletely different.
It's only served to remind me that Tsubasa is\nstill the player I admire most.
So I've gotta stop this. Now that I finally have\nmy favorite player by my side, I need to watch him\npractice, pick his brain, and absorb everything.
If I can gradually close in on Tsubasa's level,\nthe team will be better for it, and we'll be that\nmuch closer to being the world's best.
That's the spirit, Takeshi!
Let's do our best!
That I was able to pick myself back up when I was\nat my lowest is all thanks to you.\nYou've been a real inspiration!
Let's support each other as fellow Japan reps!
Okay! If you try hard and get better, I'll try\neven harder and get even better!
Let's support each other as fellow Japan reps!
Well, afternoon practice is about to begin. Let's\nhurry to the practice field, <avatar_name>!
(Thanks, <avatar_name>.)
(You're both my rival and best friend!)
I told you, Wakashimazu.
Yeah.
<avatar_name> is the first friend and rival\nTakeshi's had that's his age since entering\nmiddle school.
<avatar_name> is the first rival Takeshi's had\nthat's the same age since entering middle school.
The inspiration he'll draw from competing with\nhim is something that we simply can't give him.
Yeah, that certainly rings true.
(Takeshi and <avatar_name>... Compete against\neach other and grow into even greater players!)
(Toho Academy's second straight Nationals victory\ndepends on you!)
(Thank you, <avatar_name>. Thanks to you Takeshi\nwill become a bigger and better player.)
(You will come to know Takeshi's power at next\nyear's Nationals!)
Kicking the ball around with you like this is\npretty relaxing.
Everyone says not to worry about it, but we're\nthe youngest members of the team. It's hard not\nto dwell on it a little.
That's right! It's been a while, so why don't we\npractice some combination passes?
I have a feeling the two of us can work some\nmagic. Let's give it a try!
Yeah, I've learned a lot about breath control.\nAlright, let's give it another go!
Okay! That's the speed we're going for!\nThe quick Combo Passes just now reminded me of\nworking with Hyuga!
Whether it's at school or as representatives,\nI hope we can pair up for a long time,\n<avatar_name>.
I hope we are both chosen as reps and can pair up\nfor a long time, <avatar_name>.
Our quick Combo Passes have gotten much smoother.
(If we align our breathing a bit more,\nit just might...)
There's something I kinda want to try,\n<avatar_name>...
A Twin Shot?
I was thinking the same thing.
Y-Yeah... How did you know?
Really?!
So I suppose that means our combos are really\ncoming together.
Alright, let's give it a try!
Here we go!
W-We... We did it!
The is the first time I've been able to align my\nbreathing this much with anyone other than Hyuga!
<avatar_name>, let's give the team a shock with\nour shooting... And then the entire world!
Takeshi and <avatar_name> are both really\nimpressive.
Yeah, with those two onboard, Toho Academy will\nbe in good hands next year.
<avatar_name>, let's give the team a shock with\nour shooting... And then the entire world!
Your passing is really good lately,\n<avatar_name>. You really make it easy for the\nreceiver.
But after you pass, your play slows down a\nlittle. That's kind of a waste if you ask me.
The moment you're separated from the ball, you\nneed to prepare to receive a pass yourself.
Give your teammates a pass that will help them\nconnect their next play, and then move yourself\nquickly to disrupt your opponent.
Doing so will establish a rhythm to your attack\nand allow you gain control of the match.
To be a true playmaker, it's just as important to\nset yourself up to get a pass as it is to judge\nthe pass correctly in the first place.
I'd like you to play with that in mind,\n<avatar_name>.
Let's both do that and emerge victorious!
Oh, it's you!
<avatar_name> from Furano MS.
<avatar_name> from Musashi MS.
<avatar_name> from Furano MS.\nI remember your play from our last match!
<avatar_name> from Musashi MS.\nI remember your play from our last match!
<avatar_name> from Hanawa MS.
<avatar_name> from Hanawa MS.\nI remember your play from our last match!
I've been interested in you ever since I heard\nyou were in the same grade as me.
I'm Takeshi Sawada from Toho Academy.\nNice to meet you!
Nice to meet you, too!
The same grade... That makes us rivals.
Even though we're from different schools, it'd be\nnice if we could be friends, seeing as we're in\nthe same grade and all.
Rivals... I suppose you're right. There aren't a\nlot of first-year students in the league matches.
Let's do our best to improve our skills as two\nstudents in the same grade!
I'm looking forward to facing off against a\nfellow first-year!
Let's fight hard in the matches to come!
Let's fight hard in the remaining Junior Hero\nLeague matches, too!
Well then, catch ya later!

<avatar_name> from Hirado MS!

Can't stop me!
No holding back!
Here I go!
Now's my chance!
Got one for ya!
Here goes nothing!
Hustle!























Captain!
Your turn!
You can do this!
Go long!
Zróbmy to!
Come on!
Here we go!
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!
Kazuo!
Nitta!
Jito!
Soda!
Ishizaki!
Wakashimazu!
Morisaki!
Takasugi!
Izawa!
Takeshi!
Taki!
Sorimachi!
Kisugi!
Urabe!
Schneider!
Muller!
Heine!
Pierre!
Napoleon!
Jean!
Kluivoort!
Hernandez!
Rusciano!
Robson!
Carlos!
Keizinho!
Diaz!
Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
Alright! Got one!
Heh, easy peasy.
Ha! That was nothing.
Yeah, guys! Let's keep up the pressure!
Heh, there's more where that came from!
That's just the appetizer!
Get ready for a real show!
So... Time for me to get serious?
Heh, figured they'd have more backbone!
We're not out of the woods yet!
Still tied! Let's take the lead!
Keep up the attack! We haven't won yet!
It begins now!
Good one!
Nice!
Looking good!
No...!
What now...?!
Don't let them through!
Good pass!
Got it!
Leave it to me!
I got this!
Over here!
Here! I'm open!
C'mon! Over here!
Yo! Pass!
You won't catch me!
Heh heh!
Comin' through!
We did it, Jito!
We make a good team!
Heh, is that all from the great Tsubasa?
Ugh! Still no match for Tsubasa Ozora.
Jito's stronger than you, Hyuga!
Ugh! So you really are that good, Hyuga!
Heh heh, thanks for the win, Misaki!
That'll be me next time!
Aw, I was even looking forward to this.
Wow, Matsuyama! I got some work to do.
Heh, not losin' to you either, Misugi!
Ugh! I just can't match his technique!
I'm definitely more nimble, Masao!
How do you move like that, Masao?!
Y'can't touch me, Kazuo!
No! How can you move like that, Kazuo?
Like I'd lose to a kid my age.
I'll get you next time for sure!
Huh? You feeling off today, Jito?
Ngh! Well, that's reassuring, at least!
It won't be that easy, Soda!
I guess you really earned that title.
Heh, I'm playing for real, too, y'know.
This was supposed to be a piece of cake!
Hey, I'm surprised too, Schneider.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
Fleet of foot and sharp as a knife!
Gah! I hate losing to kids my age!
Don't take me lightly, Pierre!
Shouldn't've made it a battle of skill!
Heh, these are the skills of an acrobat!
The Shield of France is steadfast!
Heh heh, even you Kluivoort.
I just can't deal with Kluivoort!
I'm not losing to you, Dirk!
Curse you Dirk! Makin' fun of me!
Heh, I'm an acrobat, Rusciano!
Pah! Just wait 'til next time, Rusciano!
Woo! I'm good enough for Carlos!
The skills of the Soccer Kingdom, huh?
Not even Diaz can keep up with me!
Ugh! Diaz the prodigy...
Heh, my skills are top notch, too!
Oof! You've got some moves, Senghor!
Heh, outside your predictions, Ryan?
How irritating! He's reading me like a book!
Heh, Jito's still stronger, Blake!
Reminds me of Jito beating me up!
Heh... Guess it's time to get serious.
Heh! I'm the one with the ball, right?
Not so fast! We're just getting started!
You... You're <avatar_name>, right?
You kinda stood out in our match.\nI thought I remembered you.
When I saw one of your matches before, I thought\nyou were a good player and paid close attention\nto your play.
And to top it all off, you're only a first-year\nstudent, right? That's pretty impressive.
Aren't we both first-year students?!
And you're not, Sano?
Wh-What?!
I'm a second-year student! Get it right!
I'm a second-year student! Get it right!
It's fine if it's a simple misunderstanding, but\nif you're judging me based on my height, I'll\nnever forgive you...
Well, anyway. Enough of that.
Let's meet again when the opportunity arises!
You seem like a good player, so I'm looking\nforward to what's to come!
Alright, then. See you around!
<avatar_name>！
You really seem to be on a tear lately.\nNo wonder you caught my attention.
Though I wish you would have let up a little\nduring your match against us.\nJito came down hard on me after that.
Seeing a first-year student try so hard makes me\nwant to step up, too.
Alright, since we're finally together,\nlet's practice.
Alright! Let's do it!
You think you're a match for me?
Good answer! And an important one at that!
Oh, aren't we confident now?\nAre you trying to turn into Jito?
Alright, let's get started!
Huh... You're pretty agile. Expected as much.
If you're able to play like you did just now,\nyou're probably a shoe in for rep selection...
Of course, you're not the only one trying to make\nthe team. Let's do our best to end up on the team!
With how you played just now, there likely aren't\nmany schools that stand a chance against you.
Well then, keep at it, <avatar_name>
Next time, let's meet as fellow reps!
Good luck!
<avatar_name>！
I didn't see much of you during the Junior Hero\nLeague, but you're a pretty amazing player.
I know because of how you played during our match.\nThat's the first time you really caught my eye.
But I really didn't think much of you until now.
I thought you were exceptional for a first-year\nstudent when I saw you in the Junior Hero League,\nbut I had no idea how good you really were.
You've really improved your agility since coming\nto America! I need to do the same!
Still, seeing your play as of late has really\nconvinced me that soccer has nothing to do with\nage.
We may be young, but we can't let the older guys\nintimidate us!
You said it! We can do this, Sano!
Thank you so much, Sano!
Is that what it means to not be intimidated?!
Heh, you really are full of surprises...
Sure! Let's both do our best!
Alright, then. Let's practice!
Alright, let's go!
I'm unstoppable!
Hehe! It's almost like you like losing!
Argh!
...
What's wrong, Sano?\nYour movements have gotten stiff lately.
R-Really?
Loosen up and get back up to speed soon.\nYou're an important weapon for us out there.
Thank you. I'll be fine!
If you say so...
...
Ha! It's no use!\nI keep fallin' apart halfway through a step.
<avatar_name>...
It's rare to see Sano look so serious.
It's a good look for him.
Eh?
Well, I have to admit I've looked the same at\ntimes.
So how does he look normally then?
Recently, the team has been on the up and up,\nbut sometimes I can't help but remember that\nscrimmage against Germany.
In the match, nothing seemed to work.\nSure, I was light on feet, but I couldn't compete\nat that level.
But my light body is my distinguishing\ncharacteristic.
Among the reps, there are stronger, faster,\nand more technically sound players than me.
To compete with them, my only option is to\nleverage that which I do best.
Besides that... There's also next year's Hirado\nMS to think about.
This year, Jito headed up the defense, as well as\nthe offense, of the Hirado soccer team.
But he won't be around next year. With him gone,\nit will be up to me to rally the team.
But with that in mind, the harder I practice, the\nmore stuck I feel...
It really weighs on you, huh?
Maybe you could be lighter on your feet.
Stop making fun of me! I'm serious!
Weighs on you...?
Huh?
Not light... enough...
I see. Hmm. You might be on to something.
Thanks, <avatar_name>! I think I finally\nunderstand the cause of my slump!
Practice with me a bit!
Hmph.
Sano!
(Jito...!)
Keep a close eye on Jito and Sano's movements,\neveryone!
Their combined play is dangerous stuff!
(No, not here!)
C'mon! Take it if you're gonna take it!
Huh?!
Darn it! I've been outdone!
It's not a big deal. Let's get in there!
Not so fast! You're not getting by me!
Let's play, Matsuyama!
But I quit! <avatar_name>!
Huh?!
Returning!
Make it happen!
I'll take that!
That's mine now!
I won't just let you shoot!
Yes! We can't let them shoot!
Huh?!
Alright!
D-Darn it!
It's not all your fault, Morisaki. Sano stirred\nus all up on his own!
Hmph.
Thanks for the reverse cross, <avatar_name>!\nIt landed in the perfect spot!
Heh, it really seems like we'd make a great team!
Like you said, I was getting too worked up and\nputting too much stress on my body and mind.
That's why my movements stiffened up, and I lost\nmy most distinguishing characteristic.
What matters most is the ability to be your best\nby skillfully combining fighting spirit with a\nrelatively loose body!
I came to that realization the night I practiced\nwith you.
I won't forget this valuable lesson, and I'm\ndetermined to make an impact in this tournament\nand at Hirado MS next year.
Let's do our best to be the best in the world,\n<avatar_name>!
And next year we'll compete at Nationals!
Sano really owes you one, <avatar_name>.
I could tell that he was extremely frustrated.
But Hirado MS is depending on him next year.\nSometimes, I'm unable to help. I want him to be\nable to overcome things on his own.
Well... I didn't want him to have to do it all on\nhis own. If he can get help from a friend, that's\nnot so bad, either.
I need to thank you again, <avatar_name>.
You'll get Sano's thanks in the Nationals next\nyear. I'm sure he'll repay you as a worthy\nopponent.
What's wrong, <avatar_name>?
You want me to teach you my dribble?
That of all things caught your attention?!\nYou are a warehouse of surprises.
My dribbling requires ball handling with a light\ntouch, small steps, and careful observation.
Look closely at the movement of the defense while\nquickly moving and sidestepping your way to the\nopponent's back!
Yeah... I think you can handle it.\nCare to give it a try?
Just try taking it easy at first. Put too much\neffort into it and your movements will get stocky\nand slow.
Alright! Here we go, guys!
Gahaha! Got it, Sano!
Oh no!
Ack!
You're still too weak!\nGuess I'll hafta make you pay!
Phew... That was close.\nI'm just glad it was me this time...
Sano! Are you okay?!
You're overdoing it, Jito!
I'm fine. This happens all the time.
But this is Jito we're talking about...
He's always like this.
My body is small, so if I were to get hit full on\nby Jito, I'd be in serious trouble.
That's why I prepared by practicing how to relax\nmy body almost instantly.
If your body is loose, you get hurt less than you\nwould if you were to be blown off the mark while\nrigid.
This also makes movement much easier and allows\nyou to fall in a way that will keep damage to a\nminimum.
You can mess up the timing and end up taking the\nhit, but it's still way better than doing nothing\nat all.
It'd be a good idea to add this technique to your\narsenal, <avatar_name>.
If you put too much power into your body, your\nplay will get clunky. Loosening up just enough is\nthe best way to keep your movement fluid.
Hey, <avatar_name>!\nAbout practice this afternoon...
The captain told me it's my job to keep a close\neye on you.
I'm not going to go easy on you just because\nyou're younger and new to this...\nso I hope you're ready!
Bring it on!
No need to overdo it...
That's what I like to hear!\nBut be careful what you wish for!
Well, let's get this show on the road!
Hey! That's no way for a promising first-year to\ntalk! Hirado is no place for the faint of heart!
Let's get started!
Here!
Hmm.... You play well, but consistency still seems\nto be an issue.
Don't take this the wrong way, but the fact that\nthis is only your first year is no excuse.
This is just my second year, but I know I'm the\nheart of the team, and there are younger kids at\nother schools who're the hearts of their teams.
Do your best to contribute as much to Hirado\nas I do.
The best way to make your play more consistent\nis to build on muscle memory.
That's why I'm helping you with practice this\ntime... and why I had you join me to train before.
I know it goes without saying, but I'm counting\non you, so let's do our best for Hirado MS!
Hey, over here!
Darn! As fluid as ever...!
Leave this to me!
Noda! Ready yourself!
O-Okay! I'm counting on you, <avatar_name>!
You're not gonna make a difference...
What...?!
<avatar_name>?!
Łoł!
Huh... <avatar_name>.\nNice job blowin' up Sano like that.
Well, <avatar_name>...\nNow, it's time for the real thing.
Some revenge for earlier?
Bring it on!
Dang... You saw right through me.
Well, there's nothing I hate more than losing.\nJust to be clear, those earlier losses were\nnothing more than flukes.
You really like to play, don't you?\nNot that I don't...
Let's get started! You took me by surprise\nearlier. It won't happen again!
Aw, yeah!
Time to really turn up the heat!
But I never thought you'd make me go this hard\nduring practice.
You've really grown, haven't ya, <avatar_name>?
I'm still not as good as Sano!
I wish Sano would really play hard, too.
You're frustrated, huh...?
But frustration is important.
The defeat against Nankatsu actually brought me to\ntears, and it's the thing that drives me most now.
It's not that I'm trying to cut corners or\nanything. Pacing and consistency are big parts\nof how I play.
And there's not that many opponents that really\nforce me to play at my best...
Oops, don't tell the older guys I said that.
I want to win every match in the Junior Hero\nLeague to give our seniors the sendoff they\ndeserve and prepare for next year.
To that end, I'll have to get much, much better.
And besides that, this is our big chance, so let's\ndo what we can to become representatives for our\ncountry.
Ah, it's already getting dark...
We got practice tomorrow, too,\nso let's grab some grub and call it a day.
What's with that look? You expecting me to pay\nfor you?
Well, I suppose I can. Comes with the territory\nof being a senior player and all that,\nlooking out for you wee kiddies.
But don't order anything to expensive, okay?!
Hey, <avatar_name>. Don't you find it tiring in\nsuch an unfamiliar environment?
Well, it's the same for me at school,\nbut I can't help but try to be a people-pleaser\nwhen surrounded by seniors.
If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to ask.
Will do. Thanks.
So you try hard to please people, too?
To be honest, having a wee junior rep has helped\na little.
You... I can tell that all you want to do is play,\nbut school can make that pretty tough to do.
Of course, Jito and Noda sometimes say the\nstrangest things... but whatever.
As talented as all the reps are, I think we'll\nhave a tough time competing against the rest of\nthe world if we're not all on the same page.
When you're standing on the pitch, it's a\ndifferent story. Ability is what matters most,\nso don't be afraid to speak up.
Let's show them age isn't everything!
Oh, right. After dinner, I'm going to practice\nwith Nitta and Takeshi for a while. Care to join?
As representatives, we should practice with as\nmany people as possible to see if we can't learn\na trick or two from them.
Do it, Nitta!
Nice pass! Go!
Nice shot, Nitta! And good hustle!
Nitta is as speedy as ever.\nHe can easily shake free of anyone.
Rather than just be impressed,\nyou should be trying to devise a solution.
...
Dang!
Nice, Takeshi! Over here!
You're not getting off that easy, Hyuga!
(Soda dodged a mark on Hyuga, so the other side is\nopen!)
Sorimachi!
Nice pass! Go!
Crud...! Good eye, Takeshi.
Your dribbling, passing, and poise are much better\nthan I'd expect from such a young player.
...
...
Thinking about something?
(Try kicking the ball\nwithout saying anything.)
Oh, it's you, <avatar_name>.
Yeah, sort of.
Ouch! Watch it...
What is it, <avatar_name>?
Yeah, I'm not sure if I'm doing a good job\nof practicing on my own or not.
Nitta, and younger players like you and Sawada,\nare really doing everything you can to get the\nmost out of yourselves.
Of course, I'm doing the same.
The Junior Hero League gave me the opportunity to\ntake a long hard look at myself and my abilities.
If I hadn't had the realizations I did back then,\nI might not have known how to improve my game\nright now...
I remember our special training sessions together\nduring club activities.
Right now, the team is firing on all cylinders,\nbut let's continue to push even harder!
Both of us were chosen to be on the national team.\nLet's do our best in practice and in games to\nmake sure Japan emerges victorious!
...
Nitta! Take it from here!
Nice pass, Takeshi!
Fly! No-trap running volley Falcon Shot!
Not on my watch!
No way! My shot was perfect!
Ha! Sit back and enjoy the show.\nIt's counter time!
<avatar_name>, Sano!\nShow them what Hirado is all about!
Time for a real power shot!
Time to pass to Sano!
I can totally score from this distance!
Nice shot, <avatar_name>!
Oh no... I forgot about those two!
Nice pass, <avatar_name>! I've got this!
I'll put a stop to this nonsense!
He fell for it! Here we go!
What?! An overhead kick as a pass?!
Crap...!
Hmph. Those two are rather impressive.
Yeah, <avatar_name> was well aware of where\nSano was.
Gotta give Sano some credit, too.\nHe can fly with so little movement.
That's what makes him so hard to read.
Soccer really isn't about how big you are.
Our duo play is unstoppable today, <avatar_name>!
You really push me to play at my best.
You've helped me grow back at school and helped me\nshine as a representative of Japan.
I may be the older of us,\nbut you've taught me a lot.
We're driven and after the same thing.
I guess I'll be captain next year.
That's well put. That's definitely the case.
But I've got my pride having been at this longer.
I'll show you something that only comes with\nexperience!
It's a bit too early to be claiming that title!
You always get ahead of yourself.\nI'll work hard to keep you in check.
My pride as an upperclassman won't allow it!
We'll be playing one-on-one, first to three!
The only way to improve our combo play is\nto improve our solo skills.\nI'm more than up for a challenge!
Let's do this, partner!
(How great life is now!)
(I gotta give it to <avatar_name>. He's really\nhelped Sano grow two, no, three-fold.)
(Sano, <avatar_name>...\nYou two won't only lead Hirado next year...)
(You'll be at the forefront of middle school\nsoccer next year!)







Hoo-ah!
Bringin' the heat!
Check this out!
There it is!
Bit off more than you could chew!
Go!
Get in there!

Alright!
Heck yeah!
See? Even I can do it.
And you thought I could only dribble!
See, I'm not a one-trick pony!
Get a load of that, guys?
Ya like that?
Tak! We caught up!
We're leaving 'em in the dust!
Don't count us out yet!
We're still just tied!
Don't get careless!
Don't give up!
What a play!
Boom!
There we go!
That's not good!
Oops.
Trip 'em up!
What a pass!
On it!
This'll be easy!
Time to shine!
I'm open!
This way!
C'mon! This way!
Pass, please!
Just try and stop me!
Heh heh!
My time to shine!
I got a whole bag of tricks!
How! How'd you know I'd do that?
That's just who I am, Hyuga!
Łoł! Too much power for me, Hyuga!
Heh. I'm pretty good now, huh Misaki?
Knew you had it in you, Misaki!
Not to you, Matsuyama!
There you go! That's Matsuyama for you!
Heh. See how I did that, Misugi?
As good as ever, Misugi!
Heh, looks like I win, Masao!
Łoł! Pretty good, Masao!
Heh, looks like I win, Kazuo!
Łoł! Nice, Kazuo!
Too fast for you, Nitta!
Not bad, ya lil punk!
I got ya this time, Jito!
I still can't believe that power, Jito!
I win, Soda!
S'what I get for doubting ya, Soda!
Not to you, Ishizaki! Anyone but you!
Are you really Ishizaki?!
Heh! How's that, Takasugi?
I-Impressive, Takasugi!
Heh! I'm not losing to you, Izawa!
You're amazing, Izawa!
I win this Silver Duo faceoff!
I can't believe I lost to Kisugi!
This is what I'm made of, Schneider!
You're as good as Wakabayashi says!
Don't think too highly of yourself!
I've been made a fool by that buffoon!
Hehe, I don't think so, Pierre!
What a fierce commander France has!
This is payback for making fun of me!
Nice moves, Jean!
This is my win, Kluivoort!
Not too shabby, Kluivoort!
See how good I've gotten, Kaiser?!
I'm not giving up yet, Kaiser!
Don't belittle me, Rusciano!
This guy's moves are insane!
I've got grit, too, Carlos!
Carlos, you truly are gifted.
I won't lose to you, Diaz!
Diaz, you've got some serious skills!
This is my win, Senghor!
Amazing technique, Senghor!
How'do you like that, Ryan?!
Was I so obvious to him?!
Power's not everything, Blake!
I hate dealing with people like him.
He's just a copycat!
The sideline is my backyard!
Here it comes, Izawa!
Alright!
Nice cross, Taki!
Yo, um... <avatar_name>, right?
You kinda stand out, you know.\nAs that first-year who made regular at Furano MS.
You kinda stand out, you know.\nAs that first-year who made regular at Musashi MS.
You kinda stand out, you know.\nAs a first-year other than Sawada who made regular\nat Toho Academy.
I mean, in a great team like that?\nYou must be as good as Tsubasa or something.
So, can I help you?
Your touchline play was amazing!
Can you only do touchline plays?
Thanks. I mean, it is my specialty.
I'm pretty confident that no one\nwould beat me at them.
Hey, learn some manners!\nOf course, I can play in other places.
But the sides are definitely my specialty.\nI won't deny that.
Oh yeah, we're going up against\nyour school next game.
I can't wait! With me there,\nthe touchlines are ours!
Oh yeah, your school's in the same league as us.
I can't wait for our game!
Hey, I saw your game, <avatar_name>.\nYou're not half-bad.
Of course, from where I'm standing\nyou've got a long way to go!
Nah, you're no match for me, Taki.
Then prove it! Let's go, right now!
What?! Is that a challenge?!
Oh, so you're a tough guy! Sure, you're on!
We'll make it a race!\nWhoever dribbles to the goal line faster wins!
Ready, set... Go!
(Hmph. Like I'd ever lose to a first-year!)
(What?! He caught up?!)
It's not over yet!
Phew... I win!
But I gotta admit, you put up a better fight\nthan I expected. Sorry for dissing you earlier.
Anyway, this is just the warm-up for\nthe real game! Better watch your sides!
I'm getting excited for our match now!\nBetter watch your sides!
Nice dribble!
You're really into the training, huh?
To be honest, you didn't seem like anything\nspecial back in the Junior Hero League, but seeing\nyou train I can tell you've got the special sauce.
I mean, you stood out as the first-year who made\nregular, but I never imagined you'd make it onto\nthe All-Japan team.
Looks like you've gotten a lot better at\ndribbling, too. But as the veteran around here,\nI'm not gonna lose to you!
Anyway, now that we're teammates, let's both\ndo our best! When we surge up the sides,\nthey won't know what hit 'em!
Racja! I'll run circles around them!
Of course! I'm the best at running!
Ha ha! Good to hear!\nI'll be spinning my wheels, too!
Hey now, I can't let that go!\nI'M the best at running!
Anyway, let's aim for number one together!
Go!
You won't stop me!
Here, finish it!
This is it! Fast break!
This is our chance to counter!
...
*pant* *pant*
No way I'm tired after just that. I can do this!
Yo, <avatar_name>.
You've really been showing your stuff out there\nlately! Watching you play, I feel like maybe we\ncan actual win this whole thing.
So... you're here to practice too?
Why're you out late, Taki?
Why are you working touchlines?
Eh, had a little something on my mind.
Why? Eh, just some stuff.
You know how my specialty is dribbling down\nthe side and passing it forward, right?
Well, this team already has plenty of people good\nat dribbling, passing, and getting the ball up\nthe field.
Tsubasa pointed it out before Nationals, too,\nbut I really feel like a one trick pony.
So I figured it'd help a lot\nif I expanded my repertoire, but...
In the end, I always end up angling in\nfrom along the sides of the field.
I want to specialize even more.\nI want this to be MY place.
Hey, mind training with me, <avatar_name>?
There's a lot of stuff I can't practice on\nmy own. Like going head-to-head on the touchlines,\nor the timing for crossing.
Got it!
Could you help me with mine, too, then?
Thanks!
Sure thing!
Okay, let's get started already!
(Taki...)
I'm open, <avatar_name>!
Ha, we did it!
That was incredible, Taki.
Tsubasa...
A feint on the touchlines needs to make sure not\nto step over the line, but the one you did just\nnow was perfect.
I'm sorry, Tsubasa.\nMaybe you think I'm still just a one trick, but...
This is what I want to do.
Yeah. And I think you should.
Huh?
Back before the start of the Shizuoka Regionals,\nyou were overconfident from our two championship\nwins.
So you were overrating your touchline play.\nThat's why I warned you about being only good at\none thing. A "one trick" as you said.
But you're different now. You're not just being\ncomplacent, you're really determined to make that\nspot your own.
That means a lot for the team.\nThat's a specialty. A style you can be proud of.
Thank you, Tsubasa! That means a lot to me.
Mind if I join in next time\nyou two practice together?
Attacking from the side is one of the basics of\nsoccer, so it can never hurt to work on it!
Of course, Tsubasa!
Let's practice my touchline play then!
Yeah, let's do this you two!
I'm not handing it over that easy!
Alright! Time to make all the\nworld's touchlines by own backyard!
Yeah, that's the spirit!
Yeah, it's definitely easier to play\non the touchlines.
You love the sides that much?
One trick pony.
Yeah, it's been my thing for a while now.
Tsubasa told me that, too...
The touchlines don't see as much play as\nthe center, so the grass is smoother there,\nand it's easier to dribble.
Plus, everyone's going to be to one side of you,\nso it's easier to follow the big picture.
Which makes it easier to decide what to do next.
I know, I'll teach you the trick.
Attacking from the side is the basics of the\nbasics, so even if it's not your specialty,\nyou'll get plenty of use out of it!
Well, you've been pretty wobbly until recently,\nbut now you can dribble along the side without\ndrifting to either side!
...
Hey, <avatar_name>, I just realized something...
We've been thinking so much about attacking from\nthe side, but what's the defender's side of the\nstory?
With all these players from every country here,\nshouldn't we try asking them? Maybe we could see\nwhat they do.
And when I think defense, you think Italy.
Oh, perfect, they're practicing touchline tactics.
...
Oh, I see. Seeing it from above helps a lot.\nSo they can block incoming plays from the side\nwith that kind of formation?
But it looks like their positioning's a little\nmessy when they're lofting the ball to the front\nlines.
Let's try asking them about it when they're done.
Oh hey, if it isn't <avatar_name>.
And who's this with you?
I'm Hajime Taki. Nice to meet you.
Yeah, same here.
Are you two Japanese players?
Yeah, I'm Hajime Taki, and this is <avatar_name>.
Well, I'm Zino Hernandez. Nice to meet you.
Did you need something?
Actually...
You want to know how an offense pushing in from\nthe touchline feels from a defensive perspective?
Yeah. And since Italy has one of the best\ndefenses in the world, who better to ask?
Makes sense.\nAnd I just love to talk about soccer, so win-win.
Thanks!
Well, I'm not the guy to talk to for all the juicy\nstrategic details, but there is a way to stop an\noffense from the side.
But it's a lot easier to screw up\nthan just tightening up the middle.
Because both the players on the field and me,\nthe goalie, need to divide our attention between\nthe middle and the sides.
The wider the area you have to keep an eye on,\nthe easier it is to overlook something,\nand let a play slip through.
This lets the opponent build up momentum,\nand is all-around not what you want.
Wow, so even Italy has trouble with it?
So it sounds like even Italy hates it\nwhen they get attacked from the side.
So basically... we were right all along!\nVindication!
Even a defensive team will fall before\nour dominance of the touchlines!
I was right to become a specialist!
Now, let's get practicing already, <avatar_name>!
With both of us on the field,\nwe can cover both sides at once!
Here it comes, Izawa!
Alright!
Nice cross, Taki!
Yo, um... <avatar_name>, right?
You kinda stand out, you know.\nAs that first-year who made regular at Furano MS.
You kinda stand out, you know.\nAs that first-year who made regular at Musashi MS.
You kinda stand out, you know.\nAs a first-year other than Sawada who made regular\nat Toho Academy.
An amazing first-year from Hanawa MS kinda stands\nout, you know.
I mean, in a great team like that?\nYou must be as good as Tsubasa or something.
Wow... You've really got it in you.
So, can I help you?
Your touchline play was amazing!
Can you only do touchline plays?
Thanks. I mean, it is my specialty.
I'm pretty confident that no one\nwould beat me at them.
Hey, learn some manners!\nOf course, I can play in other places.
But the sides are definitely my specialty.\nI won't deny that.
Oh yeah, we're going up against\nyour school next game.
I can't wait! With me there,\nthe touchlines are ours!
Oh yeah, your school's in the same league as us.
I can't wait for our game!




I heard there are some amazing younger players.\nBe on the lookout.












Hyup! Go long, Taki!
Heh, nice pass!
Go get it, Kisugi!
Tak!
Nice pass, Taki! Your aim's getting better!
Duh! That's my secret weapon!
Yo <avatar_name>.\nWhat'd you think of that play just now?
You're great at running up the line.
I could've done better.
Thanks. You can use it as reference if you like.
Ha, being a little cocky's not a bad thing.\nWay better than acting weak anyway.
But watch out, nothing's more pathetic than\ntalking big and not being able to back it up.
I could watch over your training for you,\nif you like. I mean, it's only natural to\nhelp out the rookie.
How about I stick around after practice\nwith you next time we have the opportunity?
Hey now, don't be shy. I'm expecting about\nas much from you as I do from Tsubasa.
This is all for Nankatsu's future! I wanna help,\ntoo!
Hey, <avatar_name>. You have a spare moment after\nthis? I was thinking we could practice together\ntoday.
You do? Great!\nThen I'll take a quick look at your dribbling.
Why dribbling?
Because that's my forte, duh! What, you expected\nme to teach you something I'm NOT good at?
Anyway, let's get this show on the road!
Huh, not bad at all.\nI can hardly believe you're just a first year.
But it's still not good enough to be a regular\naround here.
To put it a different way, I would say\nyou're lucky you got into Nankatsu.
You've got all these skilled players to learn\nfrom. You should try to pluck the fruits of our\ntalents while you can.
I mean, look at me. Watching Tsubasa is what\ndrove me to become what I am.
I pride myself on being an irreplaceable part of\nthe team as a forward, even if Tsubasa's plays are\nflashier than mine.
That said, there's no shortage of matches\nI've put in motion from the touchlines.
Why, when we played Hirado during Nationals,\nI broke past Jito to assist in scoring\nthe winning goal.
I helped Nankatsu become three-time tournament\nchamps. And personally, being picked as a star\nplayer was the result of my hard work.
So you should work hard, too. Get better than you\nare now, and help the team land their fourth and\nfifth championships!
Consider it done.
I've got some big shoes to fill.
With confidence like that, you'll do just fine!\nDon't let me down. I'm counting on you!
Being scared like that isn't gonna get you\nanywhere. All the other schools are gonna be\ntrying to take us down next year, you know.
Have some confidence!\nYou've got the skills to back it up!
Speaking of which, there's a chance we could get\npicked as reps if we prove ourselves during this\ntournament.
I'm pretty sure of myself, but we might as well\ntry and make it together, eh?
Well, now that that's settled, let's not get\ncomfortable. Let's keep working harder and\nreaching higher!
The goal is for us both to become reps!\nNow, back to the grind!

Same ol' <avatar_name>, you put so much energy\ninto polishing those skills.
You were always at it at school, but hey, that\neffort shows every time you step on the field.
That said, if you're gonna do it anyway,\nI'd appreciate an invitation.
I told you before, didn't I?\nTo practice together next time, remember?
Looks like you've been working on your dribbling,\ntoo. But as the veteran around here,\nI'm not gonna let you show me up!






Here it comes, Izawa!
Alright!
Nice cross, Taki!
Yo, um... <avatar_name>, right?
You kinda stand out, you know.\nAs that first-year who made regular at Furano MS.
You kinda stand out, you know.\nAs that first-year who made regular at Musashi MS.
You kinda stand out, you know.\nAs a first-year other than Sawada who made regular\nat Toho Academy.
You kinda stand out, y'know. Even with Nitta\naround, it's hard not to see what you're doing\nat Otomo.
I mean, in a great team like that?\nYou must be as good as Tsubasa or something.
Wow... You've really got it in you.
So, can I help you?
Your touchline play was amazing!
Can you only do touchline plays?
Thanks. I mean, it is my specialty.
I'm pretty confident that no one\nwould beat me at them.
Hey, learn some manners!\nOf course, I can play in other places.
But the sides are definitely my specialty.\nI won't deny that.
Oh yeah, we're going up against\nyour school next game.
I can't wait! With me there,\nthe touchlines are ours!
Oh yeah, your school's in the same league as us.
I can't wait for our game!







Haaah!
Raaah!
Going in!
This is the moment!
How d'ya like me now?!
Get in there!
C'mon ball!

Witness my might!
I'm no Hyuga, but I've got some moves.
I did it! I scored one!
Hard work pays off!
Did'ja see that, everyone?!
I mean, I am a forward for Toho!
Let's keep it up and win this thing!
Let's go off the rails!
Band together and take this game back!
The game's tied! We've got a chance!
They're catching up but don't fret!
We can come back if we work together!
Awesome play!
Some heat on that!
Oh, I'm psyched up now!
That's gonna be a problem!
What the...?!
Stop 'em!
Awesome pass!
Alright!
All over it!
I got this!
I'm open!
This way!
I know you see me!
Pass it!
If you'll excuse me!
Go! Go!
And... Here we go!
You're not gettin' ground off me!
You're really somethin' else, Tsubasa...
I won't give up so easily, either!
Gah! Now that's the Hyuga I know.
I'm no easy mark, Misaki!
Your technique is next level, Misaki...
I practice as much as you, Matsuyama!
Blegh! Need more practice...
You're on lockdown, Misugi!
Only Misugi could pull that off.
You're not getting past, Masao!
Ugh, I really need to practice more.
You think I'm letting you past, Kazuo!?
You're still rough around the edges!
No way. I won't accept this, Nitta!
Jito! Come at me full force next time!
Gah! You may be as strong as Hyuga!
I'm not as easy as I look, Soda!
Man that guy's annoying.
I won't lose that easily, Ishizaki!
Beat by Ishizaki. I need to practice.
Not gonna lose to you, Takeshi!
Man I hate playing against you, Takeshi.
Soccer is my life, too, Schneider!
You sayin' I'm missing somethin'?
I took one from your playbook, Schester!
Amazing. I've still got a ways to go!
Margus! I'm a far better player now!
So much work to do.
That's what you get, Heine!
I hate to admit it, but that guy's good.
I don't practice to lose, Pierre!
I won't be shaken by this, Pierre!
You're too lackadaisical, Jean!
I got your number next time, Jean!
Not gonna lose to you, Kluivoort!
Is Kluivoort so much better than me?
Cut the cocksure attitude, Rusciano!
When he's serious he's got moves...
I'm glad to see my move works on you.
Your signature moves are high art.
I won't lose! Not even to prodigies!
No wonder everyone calls you a prodigy!
I'm no pushover!
That's some technique you got there!
Don't underrate me, Ryan!
He knows my every move!
I think Hyuga's stronger...
This power rivals Hyuga...
Soccer's not a one-man sport!
Soccer's all about playing as a team!
We haven't lost yet!
Yo, <avatar_name>.
Whether it's practice or a match,\nyou really put your back into it!
You can't rely on that, though. Let your guard\nslip for a second and you'll be surpassed.\nThat's how things run in Toho's soccer club.
For now, try to find what you're best at. Then\ntake that and run with it. Make it your weapon.
The core of our attack is Hyuga, then Takeshi\nin the midfield, and Wakashimazu on defense.
You have to really put some thought into how you\nfit into that scheme. Otherwise, say goodbye\nto your spot as a regular.
I'll do my best!
What role do you play, Sorimachi?
Good answer. That energy is important.
Me?
I'm out in front supporting Hyuga. And if I see\na chance to score, I take it. That's my role.
See, Hyuga's a bonafide ace, which gives him\na lot of attention. The harder he's marked,\nthe more openings are created elsewhere.
Right, well, keep up the good work, <avatar_name>!
<avatar_name> you've been doing some\ngood work out there in recent matches.
Seriously, you've come really far,\neven by Toho's standards.
I thought you were a pretty good player during\nthe tryouts, but I didn't expect this level of\ncommitment.
It's thanks to everyone's guidance!
I've still got a ways to go.
I appreciate you saying that.
It's pretty amazing keeping up\nwith all we have you do, though.
I won't disagree with you there.
But I'm also not surprised Hyuga saw your\npotential and put you in among the team's\nbetter players.
Toho Academy gathers the best players from around\nJapan. The training we do matches that level.
The biggest enemies of your daily practice and\ndevelopment are injuries and illness so take\ngood care of your health, okay?
Now, do your stretches and start practicing!
We all have to keep upping our game\nif we wanna sweep the Junior Hero League!
And to become reps after that,\nwe'll have to work even harder still!
(Jeez, so much for this new running course.\nLook how late it is.)
Hmm? Hey, aren't you...
Oh, yeah. <avatar_name>, right.\nWe had a hell of a time against you.
<avatar_name>, right? I recall seeing one of\nyour matches. You made some pretty good plays.
Anyway, what are you up to at this hour?
I came to see the practice!
I came to see you, Sorimachi.
Well, it's true we have lights set up\nand practice fairly frequently at night,\nbut everyone's already gone home today.
If you wanna catch a practice,\nyou'll wanna come a little earlier next time.
You did?
Well, that's nice, but it really is pretty late.\nLet's meet up again another time.
So how'd you get here?
Train, huh?\nWell, here, I'll walk you to the station.
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
You okay, Kaneda... <avatar_name>?!
Owww... I'm okay.
Hey, <avatar_name> your leg's bleeding.\nDoesn't look too bad, though.
Still, you'll wanna get it disinfected.\nGet it checked out.
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Sanada, <avatar_name>, you guys okay?!
Ouch... Yeah, I'm fine.
Whoa, <avatar_name> your leg's bleeding.\nWound's not that big, though.
Still, you'll wanna disinfect it\nand get it properly looked at.
Ow!
Oh <avatar_name>, did you get hurt, too?
Practicing, huh?
Eh, it happens sometimes...\nYou knock into one another.
I'm here getting treated for my injury.\nGot tackled by one of your defenders during\nthat match.
Oh, no, don't worry about it.\nIt wasn't a foul or anything.\nIt was from a regular play, fair and square.
I got tackled by a defender at a recent match.\nJust here to get it looked at.
The league is fierce this time. Every team is\nplaying with all they've got, even in exhibition\nmatches. Us at Toho included, naturally.
Not to mention, the Japanese reps will be chosen\nsoon, as well, so every school's players will be\ndoing what they can to stand out.
In matches like those, injuries like this\nare bound to happen sooner or later.
Being a forward and taking risks means you get\ntackled often. It's kind of a badge of honor,\nin a way.
Does Hyuga get tackled even more?
I hate getting hurt...
Probably. But he's not the kind of person\nthat would ever complain about it.
As a fellow player...\nI really respect that about him.
I mean, it's not like I like it either.
But if no one was marking me, it would mean I\ndon't seem like a threat. Is that any better?
Hey, get yourself patched up, too.
Man, that stuff burns, doesn't it?\nI wish they'd find a gentler med.
I wanted to say...\nYou've been doing great lately.
You're a solid player, so with the kind of skill\nyou've been showing, you might get chosen to\nrepresent Japan.
It'd be nice to meet again as reps.\nLet's keep working hard!
You know, we might have a match against each\nother in the future. I don't want you to play\nall weird around me, though.
Don't let me off easy! I won't be giving you\nany breaks either! Let's make it a good battle!
Then when the league's over, maybe we'll be\nlucky enough to represent Japan together!
<avatar_name>!
We didn't really get to talk much at school\nbut you really are a great player.\nMakes sense you piqued Hyuga's interest.
You weren't just made a regular at Toho Academy,\nyou even got to play as a representative!
You're an awesome player, you know that?\nNo surprise Hyuga picked you out in the tryouts.
Not to mention, you really\nlistened to what I told you.
You found what you're best at and made\na dang fine weapon out of it. Good stuff.
Isn't it great? You got victory in the Junior\nHero League and you got to become a rep, too!
You were one of the first-year regulars during\nthe Junior Hero League, but I didn't notice you\nmuch.
But after getting to play together as reps\nyou blew me away. You're good, man.
I think it was during the Junior Hero League.\nYou came all the way to school at night to see\nme, right?
Back then I thought you were a little weird\nbut after seeing you play up close,\nit's clear your skills are legit!
I remember saying "let's meet as reps" during the\nJunior Hero League, so I'm glad we both got it!
Since coming to America, it's really sunk in\nthat we're playing at a different level here.\nI've had a couple of rough times, too.
We just have to do our best though,\nnow that we're wearing these rep uniforms!
Let's be the best reps we can be!
Well, you won't show me up, Sorimachi!
Tak! Let's squeeze out the best of our abilities\nand make our team a force to be reckoned with!
You're on, buddy. But don't forget, the most\nimportant thing here is building the strongest\nteam.
<avatar_name>, let's do our best\nfor the sake of the team!
Alright! Let's practice hard\nand aim to be the best there is!
Hey, practice is starting soon,\nbut Tsubasa's nowhere in sight.
Hyuga and Matsuyama aren't here, either.
Oh yeah, don't worry about them.
Huh?
Tsubasa's at the doctor getting his ankle\nchecked. Hyuga and Matsuyama were a bit worn\ndown, so I changed up their training earlier.
Ah, that's why.
Okay, everyone else is here!\nLet's get started then. First up: running!
Hmm, not really feelin' it for some reason.
It's because the three that usually\nlead the way aren't here.
Hey, everyone! I can't hear you! If you practice\nhalf-heartedly, you only let yourselves down!
Sorimachi's leading the pack.\nYou don't see that every day.
I want the forwards practicing post play now!\nLet's see, who's gonna go first?
Me!
Alright, Sorimachi, get in position.
I'm on it!
You're really going for it today, Sorimachi.
Yeah, man, what happened?
Okay! That's it for morning practice!
Hey <avatar_name>, what's up?
Were you always this dedicated?
You've been leading the way all morning.
Can't be lazy at forward.
Although, I was pushing harder than\nusual during practice earlier.
Thanks for saying that. Makes me feel like\nit was worth putting in the extra effort.
I really believe that in soccer, just as\nthere are positions, there are also roles.
In this rep team, the ones leading the way\nare usually Hyuga, Tsubasa, and Matsuyama.
But when they aren't around, someone's gotta\npick up the slack. That's all there is to it.
Soccer's about helping each other out. It's\nthe same on the team. When someone's missing,\nsomeone else rises up to take their place.
It really hit home for me this summer\nduring Nationals when Hyuga was gone,\nand I played center forward for Toho Academy.
Having to fill in for Hyuga, who'd become the\nnation's striker, and bearing the responsibility\nof leading the team... The pressure was real.
But then, leading the team to the finals,\nand to victory? Well, somebody had to do it.
So I became determined and played\nmatch after match at center forward.
I said to myself, "Without Hyuga around, the one\nwho's gonna take us to victory is gonna be me."
There's so many great players on this team.\nHyuga... Tsubasa... The list goes on and on.
But that resolve within me to help\ncarry my team remains unchanged.
I'm going to do all I can to win.
Ha! I just realized how over the top I sound.
Oh yeah, <avatar_name>, if you're free this\nafternoon, let's practice together a bit!
...
<avatar_name>, you've been doing amazing\nout there in the past couple matches.
When I first saw you at the school tryouts,\nI could tell you had a knack for soccer.
But going as far as becoming a regular\nrepresenting Japan? I did not see that coming.
When we first met, I had no idea you'd\nturn out to be such an amazing player.
The way your skills have improved... It's much\neasier to understand how good you really are.
Right back at ya.
Keep at it, Sorimachi.
Thanks, but I'm still not quite there yet.
I think you are, Sorimachi.
<avatar_name>, you should get your eyes checked.
Hyuga, Wakashimazu, you guys...
Someone without skill could never take\nover as Toho Academy's center forward.
We were fine with having Sorimachi take over\nas center forward precisely because we knew he\ncould handle it.
I don't think most people are happy to hear\nthey're going to be someone's replacement.
But Sorimachi took on the role, no questions\nasked, and excelled at it. The tying goal\nagainst Meiwa Higashi was a thing of beauty.
Toho Academy made it to the\nfinals on your shoulders, man.
I also think Sorimachi has real skill and\nacts thinking of the team, first and foremost.
I, for one, think Sorimachi has real skill and\nacts thinking of the team, first and foremost.
Dude!
Well, that's all I wanted to say.\nSorry for barging in.
Good luck on your practice, guys!
Yeah, we're gonna go back to running. Idziemy!
Yep!
(Thanks guys.)
...
You know, <avatar_name>, I may never\nbe as good as Hyuga and the others...
But the will needed to win?\nI have that in spades.
Next year, it'll be you and Takeshi in\nthis position, making Toho Academy win.
They'll compare you to Hyuga. It's a tough spot\nto be in, I know. But you can't run away from it.\nEmbrace it!
I know you can do it. I believe in you.
Next year, it'll be you in this position,\nmaking Furano MS win.
They'll compare you to Matsuyama. It's a tough\nspot to be in, I bet. But you can't run away from\nit. Embrace it!
I know you can do it. Good luck.
Next year, it'll be you in this position,\nmaking Musashi MS win.
They'll compare you to Misugi. It's a tough spot\nto be in, I bet. But you can't run away from it.\nEmbrace it!
I know you can do it. Good luck.
But before that, we gotta get\nthrough this tournament.
We may've had a tough time at the scrimmage, but\nlet's learn from it and come back even stronger.
Let's do our best to make our team win!\nWe'll lift that trophy together!
*pant* *pant*
Phew... Okay, maybe I'll do\nthe next lap while dribbling.
Oh, hey, <avatar_name>.
You're hardcore, practicing this late.
Why're you out practicing so late?
There's no time like the present.\nIt's for the team.
Isn't it obvious? It's all for the team.
This summer, when Hyuga was gone,\nI had to take over as the main scorer.\nLemme tell you, it was no cake walk.
But it made me realize something.\nBearing the responsibility of leading the team's\noffense strengthens you.
That sense of responsibility drove me to take the\nshot that tied the game during the match against\nMeiwa Higashi at Nationals.
The reason I'm practicing so hard\nis so I don't forget it.
<avatar_name>, if you ever find yourself in a\nposition where the team pins their hopes on you,\ndon't shy away from that responsibility.
It might be a lot of pressure, but you\ntake that and let it drive you forward!
Aw man, we come all this way to see Uruguay's\npractice, and they're already finished.
Hold up, is that Sorimachi?!
Really? So we agree on this, huh, Victorino?
You bet.
Not to toot my own horn here, but, as my team's\nace and main line of attack, everyone's looks\nto me to lead the team to victory.
Of course, it's a big responsibility,\nbut if I couldn't use that to fuel my strength,\nI don't think I could play well at all!
Granted, I can't deny needing\nmy team to work well with me, too.
Thanks, Victorino.\nI'm glad we got to practice together, today.
It was a lot of fun. Well, good luck, Sorimachi!
Yo, Takeshi, <avatar_name>...\nDidn't think I'd see you guys here.
What are you doing at the Uruguay practice field,\nSorimachi?
See, the other day Hyuga said, "There are tons of\nplayers from around the world here. Why not learn\nfrom some other countries' forwards?"
That's when Victorino popped into my head.\nWe played against him in the scrimmage.\nHe really pulled a lot of the team's weight.
And so, I looked around at a couple teams,\nbut when I saw Uruguay's practice, Victorino's\nspeed and technique really drew me in.
After they finished practicing, I asked Victorino\nto take some time so we could practice together.
Oh, I see.
It was really great hearing what he had to say,\nthough. After all, he is representing forwards\nfor a whole other country.
It really drove home what strikers around the\nworld have in common: the sense of duty, resolve,\nand spirit to push our teams forward.
Back at Toho Academy and as reps here,\nI've always played beside Hyuga,\nwho's a master striker.
And if we go on to play in the Toho Academy high\nschool club, we'll still be on the same team.
Could it get any better than playing with Japan's\nbest striker as your teammate? I think not.
But I can't let myself get spoiled by it, either.
In the future when I go pro, I wanna be the\nteam's best striker and carry the fate of the\nteam like I'm Atlas holding up the world.
And if I'm gonna achieve that,\nI need to keep growing as a striker.
That's how I feel from the bottom of my heart.
Wow, Sorimachi!
So Takeshi, <avatar_name>, join me\nfor a bit more practice before dinner!
I want to be like Hyuga, and have the sense\nof duty, resolve, and spirit to push my team\nforward.
I'm gonna lead the rep team and Toho Academy\nto victory on my own two legs.
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
You okay, Kaneda... <avatar_name>?!
Owww... I'm okay.
Hey, <avatar_name> your leg's bleeding.\nDoesn't look too bad, though.
Still, you'll wanna get it disinfected.\nGo to the infirmary and get it treated.
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Sanada, <avatar_name>, you guys okay?!
Ouch... Yeah, I'm fine.
Whoa, <avatar_name> your leg's bleeding.\nWound's not that big, though.
Still, you'll wanna hit up the infirmary\nto disinfect it and get it properly looked at.
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Daimaru, <avatar_name>, you guys okay?!
Owww... Yeah, I'm okay.
Yo, your leg's bleeding, <avatar_name>.
Doesn't look too bad, but you probably still\nwanna get it disinfected. Head to the nurse's.
Ow!
Oh <avatar_name>, did you get hurt, too?
Practicing, huh?
Eh, it happens sometimes...\nYou knock into one another.
I'm here getting treated for my injury.\nGot tackled by one of your defenders during\nthat match.

Give me your best shot, 'cause I'll be doing\nthe same! Let's make it a good battle!

Racja!
(Thanks guys.)
...
You know, <avatar_name>, I may never\nbe as good as Hyuga and the others...
But the will needed to win?\nI have that in spades.
Next year, it'll be you and Takeshi in\nthis position, getting wins for Toho Academy.

I know you can do it. I believe in you.

They'll compare you to Misugi. It's a tough spot\nto be in, I bet. But you can't run away from it.\nEmbrace it!
I know you can do it. Good luck.
It's not gonna be easy for you next year.\nYou might have to make up for both of the\nTachibana Bros.
It's a lot of pressure, I bet.\nBut you can't run away from it. Embrace it!
I know you can do it. Good luck.
But before that, we gotta get\nthrough this tournament.
We may've had a tough time at the scrimmage, but\nlet's learn from it and come back even stronger.
Let's do our best to make our team win!\nWe'll lift that trophy together!
Let's go, <avatar_name>!
You guys okay there, Noda? <avatar_name>?
Owww... I-I'm okay.
Hey, <avatar_name> your leg's bleeding a bit.\nDoesn't look too bad...
You really ought to get it disinfected, though.\nGo see the nurse.




















































Hirado won't have Jito next year. You and Sano\nwill have to secure the wins for the team.





Here we go, <avatar_name>!
You okay, Kaneda... <avatar_name>?!
Owww... I'm okay.
Hey, <avatar_name> your leg's bleeding.\nDoesn't look too bad, though.
Still, you'll wanna get it disinfected.\nGet it checked out.
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Sanada, <avatar_name>, you guys okay?!
Ouch... Yeah, I'm fine.
Whoa, <avatar_name> your leg's bleeding.\nWound's not that big, though.
Still, you'll wanna disinfect it\nand get it properly looked at.
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
You okay, Takasugi? <avatar_name>!
Owww... I'm okay.
Your leg's bleeding, <avatar_name>.
It can get infected if it gets full of germs,\nso go hit up the infirmary and get it checked.
Ow!
Oh <avatar_name>, did you get hurt, too?
Practicing, huh?
Eh, it happens sometimes...\nYou knock into one another.

I also think Sorimachi has real skill and\nacts thinking of the team, first and foremost.
I, for one, think Sorimachi has real skill and\nacts thinking of the team, first and foremost.
Dude!
Well, that's all I wanted to say.\nSorry for barging in.
Good luck on your practice, guys!
Yeah, we're gonna go back to running. Idziemy!
Yep!
(Thanks guys.)
...
You know, <avatar_name>, I may never\nbe as good as Hyuga and the others...
But the will needed to win?\nI have that in spades.
Next year, it'll be you and Takeshi in\nthis position, making Toho Academy win.
They'll compare you to Hyuga. It's a tough spot\nto be in, I know. But you can't run away from it.\nEmbrace it!
I know you can do it. I believe in you.
Next year, it'll be you in this position,\nmaking Furano MS win.
They'll compare you to Matsuyama. It's a tough\nspot to be in, I bet. But you can't run away from\nit. Embrace it!
I know you can do it. Good luck.
Next year, it'll be you in this position,\nmaking Musashi MS win.
They'll compare you to Misugi. It's a tough spot\nto be in, I bet. But you can't run away from it.\nEmbrace it!
I know you can do it. Good luck.
Next year, it'll be you getting wins for Nankatsu\nMS. In other words, you'll be doing a lot of what\nTsubasa does now.
That's no easy task, but you can't run away from\nit. Embrace it!
I know you can do it. Good luck.
But before that, we gotta get\nthrough this tournament.
We may've had a tough time at the scrimmage, but\nlet's learn from it and come back even stronger.
Let's do our best to make our team win!\nWe'll lift that trophy together!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
You okay, Kaneda... <avatar_name>?!
Owww... I'm okay.
Hey, <avatar_name> your leg's bleeding.\nDoesn't look too bad, though.
Still, you'll wanna get it disinfected.\nGo to the infirmary and get it checked out.
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Sanada, <avatar_name>, you guys okay?!
Ouch... Yeah, I'm fine.
Whoa, <avatar_name> your leg's bleeding.\nWound's not that big, though.
Still, you'll wanna hit up the infirmary\nto disinfect it and get it properly looked at.
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
You okay, Nakayama?! <avatar_name>!
Owww... I'm okay.
Your leg's bleeding, <avatar_name>.
Doesn't look too bad, but you probably still\nwanna get it disinfected. Head to the nurse's.
Ow!
Oh <avatar_name>, did you get hurt, too?
Practicing, huh?
Eh, it happens sometimes...\nYou knock into one another.
I'm here getting treated for my injury.\nGot tackled by one of your defenders during\nthat match.
Oh, no, don't worry about it.\nIt wasn't a foul or anything.\nIt was from a regular play, fair and square.
I got tackled by a defender at a recent match.\nJust here to get it looked at.
The league is fierce this time. Every team is\nplaying with all they've got, even in exhibition\nmatches. Us at Toho included, naturally.
Not to mention, the Japanese reps will be chosen\nsoon, as well, so every school's players will be\ndoing what they can to stand out.
In matches like those, injuries like this\nare bound to happen sooner or later.
Being a forward and taking risks means you get\ntackled often. It's kind of a badge of honor,\nin a way.
Does Hyuga get tackled even more?
I hate getting hurt...
Probably. But he's not the kind of person\nthat would ever complain about it.
As a fellow player...\nI really respect that about him.
I mean, it's not like I like it either.
But if no one was marking me, it would mean I\ndon't seem like a threat. Is that any better?
Hey, get yourself patched up, too.
Man, that stuff burns, doesn't it?\nI wish they'd find a gentler med.
I wanted to say...\nYou've been doing great lately.
You're a solid player, so with the kind of skill\nyou've been showing, you might get chosen to\nrepresent Japan.
It'd be nice to meet again as reps.\nLet's keep working hard!
You know, we'll have to play against each\nother in the future. I don't want you to play\nall weird around me, though.
Give me your best shot, 'cause I'll be doing\nthe same! Let's make it a good battle!
Then when the league's over, maybe we'll be\nlucky enough to represent Japan together!
<avatar_name>, you've been doing amazing\nout there in the past couple matches.
When I first saw you at the school tryouts,\nI could tell you had a knack for soccer.
But going as far as becoming a regular\nrepresenting Japan? I did not see that coming.
When we first met, I had no idea you'd\nturn out to be such an amazing player.
The way your skills have improved... It's much\neasier to understand how good you really are.
Right back at ya.
Keep at it, Sorimachi.
Thanks, but I'm still not quite there yet.
I think you are, Sorimachi.
<avatar_name>, you should get your eyes checked.
Hyuga, Wakashimazu, you guys...
Someone without skill could never take\nover as Toho Academy's center forward.
We were fine with having Sorimachi take over\nas center forward precisely because we knew he\ncould handle it.
I don't think most people are happy to hear\nthey're going to be someone's replacement.
But Sorimachi took on the role, no questions\nasked, and excelled at it. The tying goal\nagainst Meiwa Higashi was a thing of beauty.
Toho Academy made it to the\nfinals on your shoulders, man.
I also think Sorimachi has real skill and\nacts thinking of the team, first and foremost.
I, for one, think Sorimachi has real skill and\nacts thinking of the team, first and foremost.
Dude!
Well, that's all I wanted to say.\nSorry for barging in.
Good luck on your practice, guys!
Yeah, we're gonna go back to running. Idziemy!
Tak!
(Thanks guys.)
...
You know, <avatar_name>, I may never\nbe as good as Hyuga and the others...
But the will needed to win?\nI have that in spades.
Next year, it'll be you and Takeshi in\nthis position, getting wins for Toho Academy.
They'll compare you to Hyuga. It's a tough spot\nto be in, I know. But you can't run away from it.\nEmbrace it!
I know you can do it. I believe in you.
Next year, it'll be you in this position,\ngetting wins for Furano MS.
They'll compare you to Matsuyama. It's a tough\nspot to be in, I bet. But you can't run away from\nit. Embrace it!
I know you can do it. Good luck.
Next year, it'll be you in this position,\ngetting wins for Musashi MS.
They'll compare you to Misugi. It's a tough spot\nto be in, I bet. But you can't run away from it.\nEmbrace it!
I know you can do it. Good luck.
Next year, it'll be you and Nitta in\nthis position, leading Otomo to victory.
It's a lot of pressure, I bet.\nBut you can't run away from it. Embrace it!
I know you can do it. Good luck.
But before that, we gotta get\nthrough this tournament.
We may've had a tough time at the scrimmage, but\nlet's learn from it and come back even stronger.
Let's do our best to make our team win!\nWe'll lift that trophy together!

Scored one for the team!
Right into the net!
Duh! Of course it went in!
Hope everyone saw that!
Scoremongers don't miss!
We're caught up!
Time to leave 'em in the dust!
I can't stand to lose!
We're still tied up!
Keep your head on a swivel!
Don't give up!
Good one!
Kablam!
Tasty!
This isn't good!
What!
Stop them!
Good pass!
Delicious!
I got this!
Here goes nothing! And everything!
I'm open!
Over here!
Dude, over here!
Gimme the ball!
Right here!
Fire the missiles!
Ha!
I've gotten better, Tsubasa!
Man, you play on a different level.
I won't lose to you, Hyuga!
Gah! Hyuga!
Surprised how good I am, Misaki?
You really are something else!
I won't lose, Matsuyama!
Impressive, Matsuyama!
You like that? I win today, Misugi!
How are you this good, Misugi?
Masao, think that's enough to beat me?!
Agh! I lost!
Kazuo, do you think so little of me?!
You can't handle this, Nitta!
How could I lose to Nitta?!
Jito, I won't lose to you ever again!
This is crushing...!
Too good for you, Soda!
You truly deserve the name Ace Killer!
Not to the likes of you, Ishizaki!
Ishizaki... You're so different!
I win this Shutetsu showdown, Takasugi!
Nice move, Takasugi!
I win this Shutetsu showdown, Izawa!
Nice move, Izawa!
I win this Shutetsu showdown, Taki!

This is what I'm made of, Schneider!
You're as good as Wakabayashi says!
I'll never lose to a clown like you!
Jeez, Heine!
Don't look down on me, Pierre!
How the heck are you this good, Pierre?!
Taste your own medicine, Jean!
I won't lose again, Jean!
I win, Kluivoort!
So this is Kluivoort?!
I'm better than before!
How'd I lose to another scoremonger?!
Don't look down on me, Rusciano!
Wh-What was that move?!
Eat my dust, Carlos!
Brazil's playmaker is something else!
I refuse to lose to you, Diaz!
Not like this!
I win this time, Senghor!
Where'd that come from, Senghor?!
I won't lose to you, Ryan!
Does he know all my moves?!
I refuse to lose to you, Blake!
Where does that power come from?!
Teppei Kisugi! Hailing from Shutetsu!
I'm Nankatsu's scoremonger now!
Because of scheduling issues, we'll have\nto share the field with Nankatsu for practice.\nWe'll have less space than usual, so watch out!
Wow, <avatar_name>, it's not like you to miss\nthe goalbox by that much. Feeling impatient?
Ah! Watch out!
Because of scheduling issues, we'll have\nto share the field with Nankatsu for practice.\nWe'll have less space than usual, so watch out!
Wow, <avatar_name>, it's not like you to miss\nthe goalbox by that much. Did something happen?
Ah! Watch out!
Because of scheduling issues, we'll have\nto share the field with Nankatsu for practice.\nIt'll make this harder, but what can ya do?
Be careful since we'll have less space than usual!
Wow, it's rare for you to miss\nthe goal by that much, <avatar_name>.
Ah! Watch out!
C'mon now, this may be practice, but that's\nno excuse to be making such sloppy shots.
First of all, it's dangerous.\nYou're just lucky I managed to trap it in time.
I was testing you.
I'm sorry. It was my mistake.
Wait... that was on purpose?! Why you little...!
Sheesh, be more careful next time.\nOr maybe you need more practice?
Wait, haven't I seen you somewhere before...?
Oh, right! <avatar_name>, I think?
I saw your game earlier.\nI remember thinking you were a little good.
I'm Teppei Kisugi. Nice to meet you.
Come to think of it, we're going up against each\nother next. I can't sit still; I'm so excited!
We're in the same league, so we'll be\nplaying each other someday. I can't wait!
Yo, <avatar_name>.
What? Why are you reading instead of training?
Oh, it's a soccer magazine. I read that one, too.
Did you see that article on that high school\nselection camp Tsubasa went to, and the\nMS Nationals and stuff? Really neat.
They cover a lot of stuff. I'm a big fan.
I saw the feature on Tsubasa!
I only read about the pros.
That's Tsubasa for you.\nAs his teammate, I couldn't be prouder.
That's a shame...
Seriously, you should be\nreading it cover to cover!
You stand out a lot, too, you know. Since you're\na first-year who made regular. Keep at it,\nand maybe they'll do a feature on you, too.
Someday, I'll be in there, too!
So next up is finally our match, huh?
You're about to see why\nthey call me Nankatsu's Scoremonger!
But while magazines are great and all,\nbe sure to watch our matches closely, too.
Because you're about to see why\nthey call me Nankatsu's Scoremonger!
Nice one, <avatar_name>!
To be honest, you didn't really stand out\nmuch to me in the Junior Hero League.
But after seeing your latest games,\nyou seem pretty solid.
You may've missed that shot back when we first\nmet, but you've really improved since then.
Plus, after seeing your latest games,\nyou seem pretty solid.
I thought you were good back in the Junior Hero\nLeague, but ever since you became a rep you've\nreally taken off.
Your latest matches just show\nhow consistent you are!
Let's both do our best to rep Japan!\nI'm counting on you!
Racja! I'll win these matches for us!
Racja! I'll work hard so we can win!
You sure talk big, huh?\nBut I guess that just shows how eager you are!
Yeah, that's what I like to hear!\nLooking forward to it!
But I won't fall behind either!\nMind if we practice shooting together?
Chew on a Tiger Shot!
Think you can keep up with the great Shun Nitta?!
Here we go, Kazuo!
Sure thing, Masao!
I pull through when it counts!
...
*pant* *pant*
Dangit! I'm lacking in both power and accuracy...
Yo, <avatar_name>.
You've been putting on quite the show lately.\nYou definitely deserve to be on this team.
I can't fall behind either...
Why are you practicing long shots?
Fall behind who?
What do you mean why? Isn't it obvious?
What do you mean who?\nThe other players on the team, obviously.
I hate to admit it, but I don't have\nthe power of guys like Hyuga or Nitta.
That said, I can't do crazy acrobatics like\nthe Tachibana brothers or Sano, either.
I don't even have a trademark shot like Tsubasa,\nMisugi, Matsuyama, or Soda...\nWe have so many guys like that on the team.
But even in this crowd,\nI still want to be the Scoremonger.
So I have to keep on powering up my shot and make\nmy mark. I need to be even better than they are!
Do you only need power to score?
How narrow-minded for a Scoremonger.
Huh?!
What was that?!
No, wait...
...
You're right! I see it now!
Thanks, <avatar_name>!\nYou've helped me realize something.
The Scoremonger is just someone who scores\nIt doesn't matter how!
Okay, let's do this!
He's going for a Tiger Shot! Block its path, guys!
On it!
(Okay, now's my chance!)
Here it comes, Wakashimazu!
Not happening!
Nice save, Wakashimazu!
Now!
Huh?!
What?!
There!
Alright! I did it!
Oof, the timing was just too perfect!\nYou were aiming for the rebound the whole time,\nweren't you?!
Thanks, <avatar_name>!\nThat goal was all thanks to you!
This team has plenty of guys with amazing shots.
But that doesn't mean they make every last one of\nthem. The defenders and the goalie are going to\nblock at least a few.
But those rebounds are a decisive opportunity.\nSo to make sure I don't miss 'em, I focus all\nmy senses on the ball's location.
Then, I kick the loose ball in\nbefore they can react!
Maybe you think it's playing dirty,\nbut that's the answer I've come up with.\nThis is how I can keep being the Scoremonger.
A goal is a goal. They're all beautiful.
How boring...
Ha ha, glad to hear it!
Doesn't matter how fancy the shot is, a point's a\npoint. So from now on I'll only worry about the\ngoals themselves.
Come on... Don't be a jerk.
Sure, super powerful or acrobatic shots are cool.
Doesn't matter how fancy the shot is, a point's a\npoint. So I decided to only worry about the goals\nthemselves.
That's how I'll be the All-Japan Scoremonger!
You're the one who helped me realize\nwhat I was missing, <avatar_name>.
So let's keep it up and aim for the top together!
Oh no!
The rebound is going to Kisugi!
My name is Teppei Kisugi! Remember it!
Great shot, Kisugi!
That was pretty lucky!
Ha, thanks!
Luck has nothing to do with it!
I made that happen with my own skill!
Openings like that don't last for long, so I\ntrained to be able to take shots lightning fast!
If you're looking to score, too, you can't lose\nfocus for a second. I mean, who knows when an\nopportunity will roll your way?
It's nice to get a chance to watch the\nother countries train once in a while.
So that's France, right? Where Misaki lived?\nThey're incredible.
France, huh...? They were tough.
Idziemy!
Ugh!
O-Okay!
Got it!
What?!
Great one, Bossis!
I can get it!
That forward has some good moves.
Let's try talking to him when they're done.
Oh, I think I've seen you drop by before.\n<avatar_name>, right?
So who's this other guy?
I'm Teppei Kisugi. I play forward for Japan.\nNice to meet you!
So you two are... Japanese players, right?
I'm Teppei Kisugi, and this is <avatar_name>.\nNice to meet you.
Those jerseys... so you two play for Japan then?
I'm Teppei Kisugi, and this is <avatar_name>.\nNice to meet you.
I'm Bossis. The pleasure's all mine.
So, did you need something?
We saw you in practice earlier. I thought it was\nincredible how you closed in on those rebounds.
Merci. That means a lot to me.
I can't do any amazing shots like Pierre or\nNapoleon, so lately I've been thinking about\nwhat I can do.
I don't want to let any chances to score slip by!
Hey, great minds think alike!
Recently I've been prioritizing plays\nlike that a lot more, too.
For real? Then can we swap notes?
Absolutely!
Wow, that's France for you.\nSo many techniques are going into that one shot.
I feel like I've learned a lot about how to look\nfor openings, too. Thanks Kisugi!
Let's all keep at it! See you later!
Yeah, you, too!
Man, that was productive!
When the team has players specializing in long or\nmid-range shots, there are going to be a lot of\nrebounds near the goal.
And it's important for a forward to seize\nevery chance we get, no matter how brief.
That's why I'm always waiting in front of the\ngoal, ready to pop at a moment's notice.\nThat's my ultimate shot.
I mean, I've been calling myself\nthe Scoremonger for a while now.
So with my pride on the line, I'll take those\ntechniques we asked about and turn them into\nmy own style!
Come on, <avatar_name>!\nLet's get back and start practicing!
If we pull this off, we'll both\nbe known as Japan's Scoremongers!
Guess we're sharing the training grounds\nwith Nankatsu today, huh?
It'll be a little annoying, but that's how the\nschedule came out. Not much we can do now.
We'll have less space than usual,\nso be careful everyone!
Wow, it's rare for you to miss\nthe goal outright, <avatar_name>.
Ah! Watch out!
C'mon now, this may be practice, but that's\nno excuse to be making such sloppy shots.
First of all, it's dangerous.\nYou're just lucky I managed to trap it in time.
I was testing you.
I'm sorry. It was my mistake.
Wait... that was on purpose?! Why you little...!
Sheesh, be more careful next time.\nOr maybe you need more practice?
Wait, haven't I seen you somewhere before...?
Oh, right! <avatar_name>, I think?
I saw your game earlier.\nI remember thinking you were kinda good.
I'm Teppei Kisugi. Nice to meet you.
Come to think of it, we're going up against each\nother next. I can't sit still; I'm so excited!
We're in the same league, so we'll be\nplaying each other someday. I can't wait!
We're sharing the field\nwith Nankatsu today?
I'm finding it hard to focus.
We could only squeeze into this slot.\nPut up with it.
We'll have less room than usual,\nso be careful everyone!
Wow, it's rare for you to miss\nthe goal by that much, <avatar_name>.
Ah! Watch out!












Incoming!
Nice pass! And, got it!
Ack, ya got me!
Hehe. I'm not known as Nankatsu's Scoremonger\nfor nothing.
Will I get that good, too?
Where do I apply to be a Scoremonger?
Well, it depends how hard you work for it.
I'm not just banking on my natural talent,\nyou know. I got this far on busting my butt.
Uh, wait, what? Scoremonger's not like some job.
But if what you mean is you wanna be one,\nI won't stand in your way.
Okay, before we start, let's see what you can do.\nWe'll talk after that.
Taki! Send <avatar_name> a pass\njust like the one earlier!
You got it!
Alright, <avatar_name>, show me you can make\nsomething of Taki's pass.
Here it comes!
Guh!
Phew, that was close.
Hmm, looks like we've got some work to do.
That was a pretty good shot, though.
Trust me on this. I'm a natural forward.\nI know a good shot when I see one.
But yeah, there's a couple things we can tweak\nabout that shot just now. Let's get to it.
After all, I want you to pick up the mantle\nof Scoremonger for Nankatsu!
Right. Let's see another one.
Hmm, if you put your back into the shot a little\nmore, it'll fly harder. Here, gimme the ball for\na sec.
Dang, we sure kicked the day away, eh?
I can tell the training was good for you, too.\nYou're getting way stronger.
Next year, the main force of the team—Tsubasa\nand us, the Shutetsu Quartet—will all be gone.
But we all really wanna see you guys going for\na fourth and fifth championship. I'm serious.
So, from next year, I want you at the heart\nof the team doing your best.
Count on Nankatsu's new Scoremonger.
You'll see. I'll outscore even you.
That's heartening, but make sure you actually back\nthat cockiness up with your skills, okay? You'll\nonly be a Snoremonger if you're not scoring.
Honestly, I can't wait to see that. But make sure\nit's more than just talk. Don't wanna bring shame\nto the Scoremonger name.
One thing, though. If you become a Scoremonger,\nother teams will start tackling you with a\nvengeance. Be ready for that.
Course, if you can't handle that,\nthe title never fit you to begin with.
During Nationals, it wasn't just Tsubasa getting\ntackled. I had to play through an injury from a\nparticularly fierce tackle.
But I've got the will of the Scoremonger.\nI bet on myself when we played Hirado\nand landed the winning goal.
My plays may not have Tsubasa's pizzazz,\nbut I don't think we would've gotten the third\nchampionship if I hadn't been there.
Show your will and your skills are just as strong,\nif not stronger. That's what I'm looking forward\nto.
So, what now? Wanna call it a day?
...Hehe. There you go.\nAlright, I'll join you, then.
I'm not just doing it for this tournament.\nI also wanna train enough to land a rep spot.
You've been playing really well this tournament,\nyourself. Who knows?\nMaybe we'll play as reps together, too!

Come to think of it,\nwe haven't talked much since becoming reps.
But your work out there in recent matches\nhas been a sight to behold!
You've improved a heck of a lot since the first\ntime you came to me looking for advice.
But after seeing your latest games,\nyou seem pretty solid!
I was hoping you'd become Nankatsu's heart,\nso to speak, but to think you'd come as far as\nrep is something else.
Your play in the latest matches shows just how\nconsistent you are!
Let's both keep doing our best to represent Japan!\nI'm counting on you!

See that?!
I always deliver when I need to!
I won't stay in the shadows anymore!
Here's the real me!
Practice does make perfect!
Never fail to realize my greatness!
I did it!
Time to take the lead!
Let's keep it rollin'!
Let's keep it up and\nturn this around!
We're tied! But we\nneed to stay focused.
We're still behind,\nbut we got this.
We'll show you how\npersistent we can be!
Nice one!
Nice!
Perfect!
Ack!
What...!
Break 'em down!
Nice pass!
Sweet!
I got this!
Runnin' it!
I'm open!
Over here!
Yo! Over here!
Pass the ball!
Now!
Get hyped!
Show 'em the value of practice!
Not on my watch!
I've got to do this!
You go no further!
I practiced this for you, Tsubasa!
So even that can't beat you...
Don't look so shocked, Hyuga!
Man, Hyuga! That was impressive!
I've gotten better, too, Misaki!
You're as good as ever, Misaki...
I'll never lose a battle of grit.
Am I not trying hard enough?
I never imagined I'd beat you, Misugi.
Ugh, you're just too good, Misugi...
You won't beat me one-on-one, Masao!
I can't take on Masao alone?!
You won't beat me one-on-one, Kazuo!
I can't beat Kazuo on his own?!
You're way too soft, Nitta!
Nitta, that was a good one!
I'm no pushover, Jito!
You've got moves despite your size.
I never lose a melee!
Man do I hate playing against you, Soda.
I can't lose to you, Ishizaki!
I won't lose the next one, Ishizaki!
You're too obvious, Kishida!
I'm impressed, Kishida!
I saw that coming from a mile away!
You know me too well, Nakayama.
My hard work is paying off, Nishio!
You got me good, Nishio!
I worked hard on this, Schneider!
I guess I've got a long ways to go.
Mortifying, isn't it, Heine?!
Get off your high horse, Heine!
You're not the only one who's improved!
Is the gap between us still so massive?
I found a hole in your defense, Jean!
Can I really not break through?
You like that, Kluivoort?!
Way to rub it in my face.
You're full of openings, Rusciano!
Ugh! You got me good, Rusciano!
I'm not some gnat, Carlos!
So this is the skill of a genius...
You don't compare to Tsubasa, Diaz!
I won't shy away from you prodigies!
Your lack of self-confidence is obvious!
That's quite some technique...
Didn't think I could do it, huh?
Did you study me, too?!
Pure power can't hide your blind spots!
That's some power play!
Your inferiority complex makes it easy!
I've got faith in you... No matter what.
All we can do is pass him the ball.
Alright, Nitta.\nLet's finish practice with the usual. Hit me.
You got it!
Here I go! First from the right!
Keep it comin'!
Then the left!
I'm gonna keep up no matter what!
And then to the right... Psych! Left again!
Gah. I'm not gonna lose!
Uoooh!
Yo! Working hard there.
Hey, Ishizaki. <avatar_name>.
So, Nitta's doing long lobs and Urabe is chasing\nit down... Are you working on ball control?
That's part of it.\nBut it's more mental strength training.
Come again?
I don't have the technical skill of Tsubasa\nor Misaki.\nAnd I'm not a powerhouse like Hyuga or Jito.
Truth hurts.
You really tick me off when you do stuff\nlike that.
Hey, you said it.
I know, but... Ugh, whatever!
But yeah, I was always wondering how someone\nlike me could contribute to the team.
I've told <avatar_name> this before,\nbut the reason I was called to be a rep...
I think they recognized my fighting spirit.
No one on this team can beat my stamina\nand my unwillingness to give up.
And so, I was thinking,\nhow can I make this work for the team?
Every player on the pitch follows the ball.\nThey're always looking at the player who has it.
So, I constantly make the ball my business,\nto support my teammates on offense\nand chase down the opponent while on defense.
And what I came up with was that I wanna show that\nmentality and hopefully bolster everyone's\nspirits, at least a little.
And so, to work on that desire to hunt after the\nball, I'm having Nitta kick it far enough for me\nto barely be able to keep up with it.
Oh, that's what you were doing?
Well, just so you know, when it comes to a passion\nfor chasing down the ball, you can't beat me!
Well, guess what. I've got just as much stamina\nand stubbornness as you. If not more!
Oh, yeah?! Then you won't mind a challenge!
Nitta'll kick the ball and we'll pursue. Whoever\ndrops from exhaustion first loses. Sound good?
You're on!
I want in!
Did someone say challenge?
You want a piece of this, too? That's the spirit!
I don't care who I'm up against. I'm not losing!
What? Do you wanna give it a go, too?
Doesn't matter who I'm up against. I won't lose!
Nitta! This is an earnest competition!\nKeep the kicks nice and fair!
Y-Yeah.
Urabe, <avatar_name>.\nSorry, but I've got this one in the bag!
I was gonna say that!
(Seems like seeing Urabe work hard has inspired\nIshizaki and <avatar_name>.)
(Leading others by example...\nI want to do that, too!)
Alright, that's it for today's practice. We'll be\ngoing at it just as hard tomorrow!
Alright!
That's it! Dismissed!
That's some serious training!
So this is what Otomo Middle's practice is like...
Huh? You're...
Huh? You're...
<avatar_name>, wasn't it?
What was it... <avatar_name>, right?
Right, <avatar_name>!\nI knew I'd seen you somewhere.
Right, <avatar_name>!\nI knew I'd seen you somewhere.
Here to sit in on our practice?
I'm sure you Furano guys are training hard, too,\nbut we're not gonna lose!
I don't know how you do things at Musashi,\nbut around here we like our training tough!
We're not elites like Toho Academy.\nPracticing extra hard is just how we do things.
We lost, but there's still the League.\nWe can't give up yet!
Anyway, best of luck to you!
I wanted to go up against you guys,\nbut that's just how it goes, I guess.
Give 'em all you've got, <avatar_name>!
Welp, time for some solo training!\nStay outta the way.
Quit daydreaming and get a move on!
Yo, <avatar_name>! I see you're still practicing!
Those were some solid plays!\nNot bad for a first-year!
I'm sure you know we have the\nsecond-year ace Nitta on our side!
You didn't stand out much against us, but you\nmade some good plays. Not bad for a first-year!
I'm sure you know we have the\nsecond-year ace Nitta on our side!
You may be in a different league, but I've got\nmy eye on you. You're not bad for a first-year!
I don't know if you know him,\nbut Otomo has the second-year ace Nitta!
I was sure we'd have next year's Nationals\nin the bag, but I think we've got\na rival on our hands!
Next year's star player will be me!
I can't think that far ahead.
There's some confidence!\nWe'll see if you can stick to it!
So you're the type to focus on the here\nand now. I can respect that, but\nthe future's important, too.
I can't really support your school since we're\nin the same league, but I am rooting for you,\nat least.
Since we're in different leagues,\nI'll come give my support when I have the time.
Well then, keep at it!
Hard at work, huh <avatar_name>?
I didn't really notice you in the Junior Hero\nLeague. I never thought you'd be this good!
You were really something in the Otomo match,\n<avatar_name>. How could I forget it?
The first time we met was at the\nJunior Hero League. You came to watch our\npractice if I remember.
Back then I never thought we'd meet as reps!
The only way to compete is to train as hard\nas you can. I can tell you get that.
The scrimmage showed us we don't have what it\ntakes yet, but our team is getting better\nlittle by little.
When everybody works together as one,\na team can do amazing things.
You're part of that team, too. You may be a\ndifferent year, but you're still a rep.\nDon't hold back!
Let's give it our all!
I'm not sure if we can do it...
Of course! Is there any other way?
What's with the long face?\nYou can do it! Believe in yourself!
All right! Let's get practicing!
Phew... Thanks for running with us, <avatar_name>.
There aren't too many people running\nthis time of day, are there?
U-Urabe?!
Yo, Takeshi! You and <avatar_name> running, too?
Th-That's right. You?
Yep! I haven't been running much lately.\nGotta stay in shape, y'know!
How far did you go?
Hold up, I have it on my phone... Let's see...
Ugh, only fifteen K?
F-Fifteen kilometers?!
That's practically nothing!\nBefore the Nationals I ran thirty.
Th-That's crazy...
I had to beat Nankatsu no matter what.
They had won two Nationals in a row, and they have\nJapan's number 1 player, Tsubasa Ozora.\nThe rest of them are no joke either.
When you're up against a team like that,\ncrazy training goes without saying.
You're so determined!
You lost anyway though...
You know it.
<avatar_name>...!
No... He's right. But we would have never\ngotten anywhere by giving up just because\nthe other team was better than us.
If you want to win you have to put in the effort.\nThat's just how it works.
The players are the same as they were at Otomo\nback then. If we want any chance to win,\nall we can do is practice.
Motivation is important, too.\nYou need the will to face opponents stronger than\nyou.
That's something I know you have, Takeshi.
Huh?
After the scrimmage with Germany you gave Soda\na real mouthful. That took guts.
You too, <avatar_name>. I can sense the drive in\nyou. You've got the will to win, just like me.
You guys are trying so hard even though you're\nyounger. What kind of example would we be setting\nif we let you outperform us?
Urabe...
Now, I think I feel like\na few more laps before breakfast!
Yo, <avatar_name>! What are you doing up this late?\nThough now that I think about it,\nI'm up awfully late too.
I couldn't get to sleep. I was thinking\nabout all the matches I've fought through\nand the players I'll be coming up against.
You've done great to get this far. It looked like\nyou had a tough time back during the scrimmage.
I have you to thank, Urabe.
It's STILL tough.
Hearing you say that makes it all worth it.
You never let your guard down. You might be\neven more determined than me, <avatar_name>.
Anyway, you've gotten a lot better.\nIt's like you're a totally different person\nfrom when I met you.
Even when Nitta came to Otomo a year later than\nme, I was floored by how fast he improved.\nYou're the same. Maybe even better.
You're remarkable.
To be honest, I never thought\nI'd be chosen as a rep.
At first I didn't know why I was here\nor if I even belonged.
But when I saw how downhearted everyone got\nafter our team a beating, it hit me.
It was my fighting spirit. The coach and\neveryone were betting on my drive to win.
I like to think I've helped, though it\ndoesn't mean too much if I'm the one claiming so.
I wanted to keep at it as a rep\nand aim higher and higher.
If I get better, it could have a\npositive effect on Nitta, too.
And especially Ishizaki! He can't lose!
Plus, after all, I just love soccer!
I'm counting on you, <avatar_name>!\nLet's do our best!
Let's aim for the World Cup!
I'm invincible today!
Don't be so full of yourself.
Just follow my lead, <avatar_name>. Got it?
That's four!
Alright, let's go!
Five!
Now!
Łoł!
How do you like that, Sano?
You guys really got me there.
That's my defense for ya!\nHoned to perfection at Otomo!
That's the Otomo Quartet. It's a defensive play<avatar_name>\nwe made specially to counter Tsubasa.
We anticipate the opponent's movements\nand cooperate to be in the right positions\nto counter anything they can do.
You have to know your opponent's ability, have\ntons of practice so you can react instantly,\nand have complete trust in your teammates.
If you want to lead defense someday,\njust watch and learn from Urabe!
You want to learn how Otomo plays?
It's not really anything special. If you\nstill want to know, I'd be glad to tell you.
Our basic strategy is a strong defense and\nswift offense. It's the most fundamental counter.
When the opponent gets the ball, the midfielder\nand defender quickly close the distance\nand steal the ball with a tackle.
After the steal, they pass it to the forward\nand he goes full speed toward the goal.\nThat's all there is to it.
It's simple, but that's fine since\nit's meant to be a minimalist strategy.
Besides that, practicing hard to hone your skills\nis enough. Good offense and defense\nwork in any situation.
Since it's so simple, it depends entirely on\nthe skill of the player. It takes a lot more\nthan you'd think.
I don't know if you'll play like that next year\nor not, but it won't work on us!
We have Nitta, after all. He'll bust through\nwhatever defense you've got and keep your goalie\non his toes.
Anyway, I can't wait to see what kind\nof plays you'll have for us next year!
Alright, let's play a mini game! Ready?
But the other team has Tsubasa and Hyuga...
We barely even have a chance...
Hey! I don't want to hear talk like that!
Urabe...
You have to have the guts to take on your\nopponent! Especially when they're top tier!
That kind of attitude ain't getting you nowhere.\nYou can forget about the Nationals!
You're right! I shouldn't have said that!
Tak! We shouldn't get all negative out of our\nsystems right before a match! Zróbmy to!
<avatar_name>. That's Urabe.
He loves to face strong opponents.\nI don't know anyone more determined to\nmetaphorically slay giants.
That drive for victory makes him put himself\nthrough intense training and keeps him going\nno matter how outmatched he is.
I respect that about him.
Japan has plenty of strong opponents.\nIt's not going to be easy.
That's why we have to learn from Urabe so we can\ngrit our teeth and keep on fighting no matter\nwho's standing in our way!
Alright, that's it for today's practice. We'll be\ngoing at it just as hard tomorrow!
Alright!
That's it! Dismissed!
That's some serious training!
So this is what Otomo Middle's practice is like...
Huh? You're...
Huh? You're...
<avatar_name>, wasn't it?
What was it... <avatar_name>, right?
Right, <avatar_name>!\nI knew I'd seen you somewhere.
Right, <avatar_name>!\nI knew I'd seen you somewhere.
Here to sit in on our practice?
I'm sure Hanawa MS's training is tough,\nbut they've got nothing on us.
We've been powering up this whole time,\nlittle by little.
We lost, but there's still the League.\nWe can't give up yet!
Anyway, best of luck to you!
It had been a while, so I wanted to take on the\nTachibana Bros, but we didn't match up so what\ncan ya do?
Give 'em all you've got, <avatar_name>!
Welp, time for some solo training!\nStay outta the way.
Quit daydreaming and get a move on!
Yo, <avatar_name>! I see you're still practicing!
Those were some solid plays!\nNot bad for a first-year!
I'm sure you know we have the\nsecond-year ace Nitta on our side!
You didn't stand out much against us, but you\nmade some good plays. Not bad for a first-year!
I'm sure you know we have the\nsecond-year ace Nitta on our side!

So you're the type to focus on the here\nand now. I can respect that, but\nthe future's important, too.
I can't really support your school since we're\nin the same league, but I am rooting for you,\nat least.
You better believe we were ready to take you down.\nBut what's done is done.
We'll be cheering you on from here on out.
Since we're in different leagues,\nI'll come give my support when I have the time.
Well then, keep at it!











I'm sure Hirado's training is tough,\nbut they've got nothing on us.










We've seen you play in Hirado's matches.\nYou're not bad for a first-year!








You can look forward to our match.\nOtomo makes it their mission to bulldoze giants!

Alright, that's it for today's practice. We'll be\ngoing at it just as hard tomorrow!
Alright!
That's it! Dismissed!
That's some serious training!
So this is what Otomo Middle's practice is like...
Huh? You're...
Huh? You're...
<avatar_name>, wasn't it?
What was it... <avatar_name>, right?
Right, <avatar_name>!\nI knew I'd seen you somewhere.
Right, <avatar_name>!\nI knew I'd seen you somewhere.

I don't know how you do things at Musashi,\nbut around here we like our training tough!

I'm sure Nankatsu's training is tough, but they've\ngot nothing on us.
We've been powering up this whole time, little by\nlittle.
We lost, but there's still the League.\nWe can't give up yet!
We didn't manage to defeat Nankatsu, but the\ntournament's still on. We have to keep giving\nit our best.
Anyway, best of luck to you!
I wanted to go up against you guys,\nbut that's just how it goes, I guess.
I wanted to defeat Nankatsu once and for all,\nbut we didn't match up so what can ya do?
Give 'em all you've got, <avatar_name>!
Welp, time for some solo training!\nStay outta the way.
Quit daydreaming and get a move on!
Yo, <avatar_name>! I see you're still practicing!
Those were some solid plays!\nNot bad for a first-year!

I'm sure you know Otomo MS has the second-year ace\nNitta on its side!
I was sure we'd have next year's Nationals\nin the bag, but I think we've got\na rival on our hands!
I was sure we'd have next year's Regionals in the\nbag, but I think we've got a rival on our hands!
Next year's star player will be me!
Next year's star player will be me!
I can't think that far ahead.
There's some confidence!\nWe'll see if you can stick to it!
So you're the type to focus on the here\nand now. I can respect that, but\nthe future's important, too.
I can't really support your school since we're\nin the same league, but I am rooting for you,\nat least.
You better believe we were ready to take down\nNankatsu this time. But what's done is done.
From now on, I'll be cheering you on as\na fellow Shizuokan.
Since we're in different leagues,\nI'll come give my support when I have the time.
Since we're in different leagues,\nI'll come give my support when I have the time.
Well then, keep at it!
Yo, <avatar_name>.\nI was wondering who was out here.
Up practicing early, huh? That's some drive.
You're early, too, Captain!
Regular training wasn't doing it for me.
Ya got me.
See, my folks run a tofu shop,\nso work starts super early.\nI've been waking up early my whole life.
Ouch! I've been trying to work everyone hard,\nbut I suspected as much.
Alright, well, let's train together.\nWe can get more out of working together.
I thought middle school soccer was done, but\nhere comes another chance to push myself further.\nHow could I say no?
Okay, let's stop here and catch our\nbreath before everybody else arrives.
But seriously, you're somethin' else. I seldom\nsee a first-year train as hard and as long as you.
Seeing Nitta, Ichijo, and you,\nI can't help but have high hopes for next year.
Oh, yeah! Did you have a proper breakfast?\nGroup practice is gonna start and you're\ngonna need energy to burn.
I'll split my rice ball with you, if you want!
Yo, <avatar_name>. Still here?\nEveryone already went home, you know.
What have you been up to, Captain?
You're reading comics at\na critical time like this?
Oh, I got so into my Japanese and art studies\nI just lost track of time.
Don't look at me like that. I'm joking.
I dunno who's it is, but I found my favorite comic\nhere. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop.
Don't say that.\nTraining is good, but you gotta balance it out.
And hey, check it out. This comic's about soccer.\nIt's kinda related. I can still learn from it.
There's a stack of them over there. You should\ngive it a read, too. I guarantee you'll enjoy it.
...I know, right?! That play was sick!
I love this scene, too. He gets this\ncrazy pass from his teammate, and...
Man, I'm so glad you dug this comic, too.
But you know, reading it again after all this\ntime... It actually does make me think about\nhow we play.
Oh, yeah! This comic gave me a good idea\nfor practice! I think I'll try it tomorrow!
<avatar_name>! We should try a few flashy\nplays like the guys in the comic.\nWe'd have them hollering in the stands!
Workin' hard there, <avatar_name>!
Finally felt like practicing?
You've gotten all the way to being a rep because\nof how hard you've worked. Don't forget that!
Even though you're a rep, your drive to practice\nhasn't changed a bit. That's great!
Earlier you were practicing on your own,\nweren't you?
If you wanna practice together just let me know.\nDon't be intimidated just because I'm a little\nolder!
That play you were practicing just now.\nThat was from the comic, right?
Reading it has started to rub off on you, too!\nNice!
Well, what do you say?\nWanna kick the ball around a bit?
Okay, let's take a little break.
Hey, <avatar_name>, can you feel it? There's\nsomething in the air. The team's coming alive.
The scrimmage showed us we're not quite there yet,\nbut this is proof our team's headed in a good\ndirection.
When everybody works together,\na team can do amazing things.
You're part of that team, too. You may be a\ndifferent year, but you're still a rep.\nDon't hold back!
Let's knock 'em dead!
I'm not sure if we can win.
Heck yeah! Let's get it done!
What's with the long face?\nYou can do it! Believe in yourself!
All right! Let's get practicing!
Yo, <avatar_name>! What are you doing up this late?\nThough now that I think about it,\nI'm up awfully late, too.
I couldn't get to sleep. I was thinking\nabout all the matches I've fought through\nand the players I'll be coming up against.
You've done great to get this far.\nWe all struggled during the scrimmage, though.
I have you to thank, Urabe.
It's STILL tough.
Hearing you say that makes it all worth it.
You never let your guard down. You might be\neven more determined than me, <avatar_name>.
You've made unimaginable progress.
I thought Nitta was impressive,\nbut you're the same. Maybe even better.
You're remarkable.
To be honest, I never thought\nI'd be chosen as a rep.
At first I didn't know why I was here\nor if I even belonged.
But when I saw how downhearted everyone got\nafter our team took a beating, it hit me.
It was my fighting spirit. The coach and\neveryone were betting on my drive to win.
I like to think I've helped,\nthough maybe that isn't really for me to say.
I wanted to keep pushing myself while representing\nJapan and keep aiming higher and higher.
If I get better, it could have a\npositive effect on Nitta and you, too.
And especially Ishizaki! He can't lose!
Plus, after all, I just love soccer!
I'm counting on you, <avatar_name>!\nWe gotta fight believing in the work we've done!
Let's take home the World Cup together!
<avatar_name>, today I'm gonna teach\nyou Otomo's fundamental strategy.
I know you're thinking maybe we should've\ndiscussed this sooner. But we're doing it\nnow to avoid getting complacent and careless.
So listen close.
As you know, our basic strategy is\na strong defense and swift offense.\nIt's the most fundamental counter.
When the opponent gets the ball, the midfielders\nand defenders quickly close in to get the ball\nwith a tackle.
After the steal, they move it to the forwards\nand they go full tilt toward the goal.\nThat's all there is to it.
It's simple, but that's fine.\nThere're advantages to a minimalist approach.
Besides that, practicing hard to hone your skills\nis enough. Reliable offense and defense is the\nbread and butter of a good team.
Since it's so simple, it depends entirely on\nthe skill of the players. It takes a lot more\nthan you'd think.
The kind of soccer you play next year with\nNitta and the others is entirely up to you.
Just remember one thing... Matches don't always go\nthe way you expect. Sometimes your opponents' have\nstrategies you're not prepared for.
Times like those, you need a battle plan that you\ncan always count on to hold the team together.
I can't wait to see what kind of\nplays you'll have for us next year!
All right, let's play a little game! Ready?
But the other team has Tsubasa and Hyuga...
We barely even have a chance...
Hey! I don't want to hear talk like that!
Urabe...
You have to have the guts to take on your\nopponent! Especially when they're top tier!
That kind of attitude ain't getting you nowhere.\nYou can forget about competing internationally!
You're right! I shouldn't have said that!
Tak! We shouldn't be so negative\nright before a match! Zróbmy to!
Even as a rep, he's still the same ol' Urabe.\nWouldn't you say, <avatar_name>?
He loves to face strong opponents. I don't\nknow anyone more determined to slay giants.
That drive for victory makes him put himself\nthrough intense training and keeps him going\nno matter how outmatched he is.
I wanna inherit that spirit.
Japan has plenty of strong opponents.\nIt's not going to be easy.
That's why we, as Otomo's younger players, have to\nlearn from Urabe so we can grit our teeth and keep\non fighting no matter who's standing in our way!
Huh. The strategy Nitta suggested worked out well!
Tak! We wouldn't be able to pull it off without\nthe lower body strength we've trained so hard\nto build up!
Thank you!
This is definitely one to add to our arsenal\nfor next year.
Nitta, <avatar_name>, I want you guys to keep\nironing out this strategy.
Then next year, we'll finally dominate Nationals!\nGot it?!
Right, leave it to me!







Level up!
Smooth as silk!
That's it!
Woohoo!
Tak!
Surge ahead!
Get to it!

How do you like that?!
Now that's a goal!
Score!
Right into the net!
Y'see that?!
You'd better not look down on me!
We've only broke even!
Time to go all out!
Losing is unbearable!
Time to unleash the beast!
Don't be lazy out there!
We can't give up! Not now!
Nice one!
Good stuff!
I approve.
Argh!
Bwuh!
Stop them!
Nice pass!
Every time!
You know I can do it!
Here I go!
I'm open!
This way!
C'mon! You see me!
Pass it!
I'll stop you!
You won't get past me!
M'not even capable of losing!
I've been working hard for this!
I'm not surrendering yet, Tsubasa!
M'not afraid of you, Hyuga!
Never again, Hyuga!
Can't you tell I've gotten better?
So this is how France has changed you!
Moxie's my middle name, Matsuyama!
That's some grit if I've ever seen it.
I'm invincible, Misugi!
Skilled as ever, Misugi!
How 'bout that, Masao? I win!
Ugh! Losing to Masao...
How 'bout that, Kazuo? My win!
Ugh! I lost to Kazuo...
What's wrong, Nitta?!
You've gotten better, Nitta!
Your power doesn't scare me, Jito!
It'll be different next time, Jito!
You've lost your fizzle, Soda!
Now that's what I call a juke!
Me... Lose to you? Puh-lease.
How could I lose to you?!
You see that, Takasugi?!
Gah! Takasugi!
Izawa, witness my passion!
C'mon! How does that happen?!
This is true passion, Taki!
Jeez Taki!
You catch that, Kisugi?!
Pah! Just try that again, Kisugi!
Where's that fighting spirit, Urabe?
Dude, you are fired up!
I'm no fool, Nakayama!
Now that's how you use momentum!
Child's play, Nishio!
Did he anticipate my move?!
I'll be the first to stop you!
(Okay, game's over. I got it all on video.\nThis'll be perfect for analyzing their plays!)
What was your name? <avatar_name>, right?\nI saw you in the match earlier.
You had some dope moves for a first-year.
You're... <avatar_name>, right?
You really handed it to us last match. We thought\nyou were just a puny little first-year,\nbut it looks like you know what you're doing.
Oh... <avatar_name>, wasn't it?\nI saw you in the match earlier.
You had some smooth moves for a first-year.
But don't assume it'll always go your way\njust because you can make a good play!
I know!
I'll make sure it does.
You sure about that?\nWell, I guess I'll see after this.
Heh. That's the spirit!\nFitting for a first-year on the rise!
I should head back.
Catch ya later, <avatar_name>.
Good luck in the rest of\nthe matches, <avatar_name>.
Oh, hey, <avatar_name>.\nYou here to scout the competition, too?
You bet.
I'm just here for kicks.
It's never a bad idea to do some research.
Ha! I'd say you're into the right sport then!
It looks like things are going well lately. The\nteam was getting all fired up talking about you.
Hey! Kishida! We're going back to the school!
Be right there!
See ya, <avatar_name>.
Hey, <avatar_name>. So you were here.\nI had a feeling you'd come to watch the match.
I'm not here for recon as much as\nI just couldn't miss this match.\nI'm mostly here for fun.
Me, too.
I thought a peek might be valuable.
I thought so. We're a lot alike, you and me.
Seriously. I can't wait for them to start.\nI'm so pumped!
But do you ever let up?\nYou must be super busy with practice, but\nyou still made time to come watch.
To be honest, we wanted to reach that level, too.
Well, it's not like my soccer career is\ngoing to be over after middle school.\nI'll still work at it in high school.
If I do that I'll reach a higher level for sure.\nMaybe even be a national rep...
After all, the effort we put in gave us\nthe chance to face THE Tsubasa Ozora!
Effort isn't everything, but you won't get\nanywhere without it either.\nThat's just how it is.
<avatar_name>... Based on my analysis,\nyou're capable of playing as a rep for Japan.
I'm looking forward to what you'll do\nat the International Tournament.
Oh, it started! Gotta focus!
Kishida! It's on!
End of the line!
Łoł!
You've got work to do, Nitta!
Hey, <avatar_name>. Were you watching us practice?
You'll get hurt if you do that!
That kamikaze attack was impressive!
What? Oh, you mean how\nI blocked Nitta's dribbling?
You mean how I blocked Nitta's dribbling?
Would you call that kamikaze...?\nI guess it does look pretty dangerous.
It is risky to rush at the ball headfirst.\nGetting kicked in the face is gonna put you\nout of commission.
The point is that your opponent knows that, too.\nNobody wants to seriously hurt their opponent.\nMost players will hesitate.
My tackle takes advantage of that\nopening to steal the ball!
Let me give you some advice\nin case you want to use this technique.
You can't be wishy-washy. If you aren't 100%\ninvested in the charge, your opponent won't budge.
You have to show them in an instant that you\nmean business. Do that and they'll get cold feet.
The most important thing is to have the guts\nto go for it. It'll work as long as\nyou're prepared to go all-in.
You're going to face all sorts of strong opponents\ndown the road. Show them all what you can do!
(Right, that's that for practice.\nNow, to take care of my cleats.)
Yo, <avatar_name>. Good work at practice.
Those are some nice cleats.
You always take great care of those.
Hmm?
They're not expensive ones or anything.\nMaybe they look nice since I clean them every day.
Well, of course.\nWeren't you ever told to care for your tools?
If you neglect caring for your cleats, you might\nnot be able to use them to their full potential.\nThey could even break when you need them most.
But more so than anything, they'll just last\nlonger. If you like something, you want it to\nlast, right?
I know Tsubasa says the ball is your friend,\nbut your cleats are like a part of you, too.
If you want to get the most out of them,\nyou gotta keep them in tip-top condition.\n...There. Nice and clean.
What's this? <avatar_name>, your cleats are filthy.\nDon't you clean them at all?
Here, I'll lend you my kit. Try taking proper\ncare of them. I'll teach you how it's done.
Wait, you wanna do that like so.\nUntie the shoelaces.\nYou should also remove the insoles and...
Yep, pretty nice, eh? Good as new!
Here's an idea. Why don't you keep that kit?
Let clean cleats be your first step to getting\nready. Get fired up and pass that energy on to\nthe whole team!
Yes! <avatar_name>, go!
Ack, ya got me!
That guy's been on a roll lately.
Yeah, his movements have gotten really good.\nYou're gonna have to step it up, Nitta.
He can't beat me just yet.\nI'll be the one leading the team next year.
Sweet goal, <avatar_name>!
You've been killin' it lately. And from the\nlooks of it, really active in making plays.
With cleats this clean, I get hyped to play!
My cleats are telling me to work harder.
Is that so? Getting in the mood is important.
Anyway, hearing you say that makes me\nglad I showed you how to care for them.
Oh, really? If that's making you work harder,\nthen I'm glad.
(Jeez, he's really paying attention\nto the condition of his cleats.)
(It's a very Tsubasa thing to say.)
Since you're out here killin' it,\nyou mind training with me?
It's just, looking at you go,\nI feel like I gotta catch up.
All right! Today, we're gonna dig\nour heels in and drive forward!
Yo, <avatar_name>! Pretty intense\nstarting this early in the morning.
Let me give you a hand. We can practice\nmore efficiently if there's two of us.
Man, you've really improved.
That enthusiasm to keep going\neven emanates off the ball.
You've been working really hard.
I wanted to meet　your expectations!
I want to be　the world's best.
My expectations?
Do you mean when I let you have the kit for your\ncleats? And told you to think of it as energizing\nthe team?
I see. Thanks for taking what I said to heart.
You sound like Tsubasa.
But you know, seeing the way you've progressed,\nI wouldn't be surprised if you end up pulling\nit off.
For three years, I've been working hard with Urabe\nand the others to beat Nankatsu and Tsubasa.\nBut then the tournament came and we fell short.
But those days of giving it all we had...\nI don't think they were for nothing.
It's not like we stop playing after middle school.
I'm gonna keep working hard and eventually go pro.\nI wanna be chosen as a national rep, too.
Though, I guess that's all still a ways down\nthe line. First, I'm gonna work on taking down\nNankatsu in this tournament!
So yeah, let's keep practicing!







Haaah!
Raaah!
That's what it's about!
That's it!
Check it out!
Full steam ahead!
Burn it down!

Wohoo! I did it!
Score!
That's how it's done!
You saw that, right?
Owned!
This evens it up!
Let's turn it up a notch!
There's no way I can lose!
The score's still tied!
Keep your wits about you!
Never give up!
Super!
Excellent!
Nice one!
Well...
What?!
Cut 'em off!
Nice pass!
Cheers!
Believe in me!
Here we go!
I'm open!
Over here!
C'mon! Here!
Dude, pass!
Like I'd let you!
Stop right there!
As if I can lose!
I did it! I beat Tsubasa!
You're not doin' that twice, Tsubasa!
You don't scare me, Hyuga!
How are you this strong?!
I've gotten better, eh?!
Misaki, where'd you learn that?
I'll never back down, Matsuyama!
Matsuyama... I won't give up!
I'm not the same as before, Misugi!
Grrr... I lost again!
I'll take any one of you!
Dang it! Masao, you...
Gah! Kazuo, you...
That all you got, Nitta?!
Not bad, Nitta!
I'll take it as a win!
That is some power you got there!
You lack spirit, Soda!
I won't lose next time!
I'll always come out on top, Ishizaki!
No way! I lost to Ishizaki?!
You see that, Takasugi?
Takasugi... Come on!
This is what I can do, Izawa!
Izawa... I'll never give up!
Now you've seen what I can do, Taki!
Taki... I'll never give in!
I win this round, Kisugi!
I'm never backing down, Kisugi!
This isn't some game, Urabe!
D-Don't look down on me, Urabe!
You like that, Kishida?!
Where'd that come from?!
You like that, Nishio?!
I'll get you back, Nishio!
Stop! Stop them!
I've practiced all year for this!
(That's enough recon for today. I should head\nback and analyze it with the guys.)
Nakayama!
Yamanaka!
Oh, it's you...
Umm... I'm Nakayama.
Oh, it's you!
<avatar_name>, right?\nThat was some show you put on last match!
<avatar_name>, wasn't it?
You really did a number on us back there.\nAs much as I want to, I'll never forget it!
<avatar_name>, right?\nThat was some show you put on last match!
We're in different leagues,\nbut I certainly noticed you.
Heading back from scouting?
Heading back from practice?
Otomo's secret weapon is our rock-solid defense\nbased on thorough analysis of our opponent.\nIntelligence is our most valuable asset.
Scouting of course.
Otomo's secret weapon is our rock-solid defense\nbased on thorough analysis of our opponent.\nIntelligence is our most valuable asset.
Well, I should get back to our room.\nLater, <avatar_name>!
Well, I should get back to our room.\nLater, <avatar_name>! Good luck in the next match!
<avatar_name>! So we meet again!
It's been a while!
Who were you again?
Has it...?
Well, who am I to say?\nEveryone has their own sense of time!
Wh-What? You've gotta be kidding!
I'm Nakayama from Otomo Middle! Ring any bells?\nYou must remember me from before!
Anyway, it seems like you've been doing great\nlately. Your plays have been really sharp!
That's some amazing growth in such a short time!
Oh, since we ran into each other,\nwill you help me practice?
With you as my opponent it'll be good\nexperience. Idziemy! This is gonna be great!
Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you!
We meet again, <avatar_name>!
Scouting again?
Out for a run?
Nope. I'm practicing today. I jogged over to\nthe other side of the river. I just got back.
Yup. I jogged over to the other side of the river.\nI just got back.
It's pretty far to the river,\nbut it's normal for us to run ten or twenty K.
There's nothing like a run to clear my head\nwhen I'm feeling stressed!
Huh? Oh, sorry. I was just talking to myself.\nI'm not moody or anything.
It's just... Fighting all those National-level\nguys got me thinking about a lot...
At Otomo we train as hard as anybody.\nI'm sure Nankatsu and Toho do, too.
But to beat these top-level guys, just training\na lot isn't enough. You need talent. It makes\nme wonder if I even deserve to be here...
I didn't start thinking like that until\nafter I saw you in action, <avatar_name>.
In this short time you've improved so much.\nSo much that you're a match for other schools'\naces.
But where I'm at right now...\nI've hit a wall. I'm missing something.
I want to keep playing soccer in high school\nand represent Japan someday.\nI need the ambition to keep improving.
Well, it's time for me to get\nback and practice some more!
<avatar_name>!\nGood luck on getting picked as a rep!
What gives? He makes it look so easy.
Oh, hi <avatar_name>.\nAlready done with practice today?
What are you up to?
You shouldn't be playing\nmobile games here.
Well, I was checking out some soccer vids and\nthere was this cool juggling technique I thought\nI'd try.
Check it. He makes it look so easy, but when\nI tried it myself it was stupid hard.
Huh? Oh, this? No, no, I'm using a video as\nreference for practice. I found one with this\ncool juggling technique.
I mean, I guess I found it accidentally while\nwatching funny videos... Anyway, I've been trying\nit for a while, but I can't figure it out.
The video shows you the trick to it, but I just\ndon't get it. Hey, let's try it together.
See? It's really hard, right?\nPhew, I'm glad it's not just me sucking.
Hey, if you have some time after practice,\nyou wanna work on this together?
It'll be way more fun than trying to do it alone!
Hmm, I just can't get it right.\nMaybe it's just beyond me.
Maybe we're missing　the basics.
Maybe we're starting with\nsomething too hard.
The basics, huh? I figured I'd had those\nhammered into me since elementary school.
Gimme a second, lemme check. Looks like there is\na video on the building blocks for this trick.
You might be right.\nAfter all, I did find this video by accident.
Let's see, videos before this one...\nAhh, here we go. There's a beginners' video\nand another on basics.
Makes sense. Of course, we weren't gonna be\nable to start with the hardest technique.
So first you gotta be able to do all this basic\nstuff and then you can pull off things like that!
Hmmm. I got it! <avatar_name>, we're changing our\ngame plan! Time to practice some building blocks!
Even if we're practicing our butts off normally,\nit won't do if we're missing basic stuff like\nthis.
I know. Since we're gonna do this anyway, we\nmight as well use the opportunity to solidify\nthe fundamentals of our play.
Now that that's settled.\nLet's get this train a-movin'!
There it is!
Wait, what?
You're wide open!
Nope!
Huh?!
You won't get me that easily!
Ha! We'll see!
What?! How did you...?!
How're you slithering like that, Nakayama?\nYour movements have gotten way better lately.
Yeah, I may've been a little careless today,\nbut I never thought you'd burn me that bad.
Seriously, cough it up.
I can't tell ya. It's top secret training.
It sorta feels like I have way more movement\noptions now, ever since we worked more on basics.
To be honest, I didn't feel like I was improving\nas much as I should've been, considering all the\nteam training we did.
So I got to thinking the problem wasn't\nthe amount, but the quality and method.
I actually understand my play better.\nAfter using that video's techniques,\nI finally understand how important basics are.
If you hadn't practiced with me that one time, I\nprobably would've just wondered why I couldn't do\nthe trick, and that would've been the end of it.
Well, you know what I mean... Thanks.
I don't have anywhere near enough time in what's\nleft of my middle school life to try and work my\nway up to being a rep. But you know what?
This training with you will be the basis I build\non in high school and beyond. I'll keep improving,\nand one day I'll wear the Japan uniform.
You'll get there!
I'll be waiting for you!
Well, seeing the way you've been playing lately,\nI have a feeling you'll get there first.
Oh, you think you're a rep already?
I guess you've earned a little confidence\nwhat with how you've been playing lately.
Well, <avatar_name>! Let's crank it up today!
First, we gotta beat Nankatsu!







Booyah!
I got the juice!
Right there!
On fire!
How's that?!
Go in!
C'mon!

I'm in this game, too!
What a goal!
It's in!
Right in there!
Can ya dig it?!
We finally caught up!
Let's win this thing!
We didn't come here to lose!
It's still tied up!
Pump yourselves up! Let's win this!
We haven't lost yet!
Exceptional!
Splendid!
Keep it up!
That's a problem!
What did you say?!
Stop 'im!
Nice pass!
Alright!
Leave it to me!
Go! Go!
This way!
Over here!
Right here!
Pass!
You won't get past me!
I'll stop you in your tracks!
I won't lose!
I've studied you like a book, Tsubasa!
I won't lose next time, Tsubasa!
I did it. I beat Hyuga!
Gyah, Hyuga! Maybe next time!
Heh... Surprised, Misaki?
Wow, Misaki! You got good!
I can be annoying, too, Matsuyama!
Your tenacity is unbelievable!
I don't think so, Misugi!
Misugi, you are the genuine article!
Payback time, Masao!
Masao... I won't lose next time!
This is for last time, Kazuo!
Kazuo... I won't lose again!
That's not enough to beat me, Nitta!
Now that's some flash, Nitta!
Size isn't everything in a showdown!
Ngh, what power...
This is what I can do, Soda!
Your moves are sharp, Soda!
You don't have the skill, Ishizaki!
Man, Ishizaki, you've gotten better!
See what I can do, Takasugi?!
Gyah! Takasugi!
Practice makes perfect, Izawa!
I won't give up, Izawa!
Hard practice gave me my skills, Taki!
I'm not backing down, Taki!
I've practiced hard for this, Kisugi!
M'not giving up, Kisugi!
You let your guard down, Urabe!
This isn't over, Urabe!
I win this round, Kishida!
I'm not done yet, Kishida!
This one's mine, Nakayama!
Can't believe you got me, Nakayama!
I'm the number two!
One more point and it'll be over!
Phew... I'm starting to feel the burn.\nI can't give in yet!
Huh? Aren't you...?
It's... <avatar_name>, right?\nI've seen you in the recon videos.
If it isn't <avatar_name>. You gave us a\nreally hard time with those plays of yours.
Do you need me for something?
Would you practice with me?
I'm looking for a training partner.
Sorry. I want to practice by myself today.\nThere's something I want clear up.
This late at night? You're a weird one...
But to be honest, sometimes I just feel like\npracticing at night though. I get it.\nThat's why I'm here right now.
Sorry, though. I want to practice by myself today.\nThere's something I want to figure out.
I'll make it up to you though. Let's practice\ntogether next time we have the chance!
Hey, <avatar_name>!
Are you free today?
I made some time!
Alright! I'll practice with you,\njust like I promised!
Just to practice with me...?
Thanks! Let's do it then!
That was pretty good!
That play was awesome! You've improved so fast!
You have talent, but I can tell\nyou put in the effort, too!
Don't forget... I'm an Otomo regular, too!\nWhen it comes to effort I won't be beat!
Get ready for a rematch! I won't lose this one!
Hey, <avatar_name>! You're back!
I've seen your latest plays. Pretty good!
Alright! Let's get practicing!
Nothing's getting past me today!
Łoł!
Are you okay, <avatar_name>?
Your leg is bleeding.\nI'll take care of it, just hold on!
This is nothing!
Sorry for the trouble...
Even small cuts need to be\ntaken care of properly.
Why are you apologizing?\nIt was my fault for running into you.
Anyway, it doesn't look too bad but even\nsmall cuts have to be taken care of properly.
There. It should be okay.\nMake sure get it checked at the doctor!
Back when I was in elementary school,\nI made it to the Nationals as a regular defender\nfor Nankatsu SC.
But I got hurt in an accident during the\npreliminaries and couldn't play in any\nmatches after that.
I was glad we won of course,\nbut I regret it a little.
So be careful not to get hurt out there,\n<avatar_name>. It really stinks to be benched\nover an injury.
With your ability, as long as you don't get hurt\nyou'll definitely be picked to represent Japan!\nI'm rooting for you!
Guess that's enough training for today.
I've done it now, though. Stuff's all over the\nplace. I better clean up before it gets dark.
It'll go faster if　we work together.
I guess I can help out\nan upperclassman in need.
I'm sorry, <avatar_name>.
If my aim were better,\nthere wouldn't be such a mess.
Gee, <avatar_name>, when you put it that way...
You're doing me a solid, though.\nLet's clean up before it gets dark.
If only I was better I\nwouldn't have had to bug you...
Thanks. Because of you, we got it done in a jiffy.
Okay. Let's get back to the dorms, eh?\nIt's almost time for dinner!
Alright! That's enough practice for today!
Okay guys, I've got stuff to do today,\nso I'm gonna go on ahead!
Oh? What's the hurry?
Oh, I know why. THAT goes on sale today.
Oh, you're right. That's today. Now that you\nmention it, he was really looking forward to\nthis month's.
Yo, <avatar_name>. I'm taking off now!
Pretty rare for you to　leave this early.
Something seems fun.
I know! The soccer magazine I read\nall the time goes on sale today!
You guys know me too well.\nThe soccer magazine I buy comes out today.
Also, this one's coming with a poster of my\nfavorite soccer player, so I've been dying to\nget it!
I've put up posters for a bunch\nof different players in my room.
But I've been saving up the best spot for today's.
Hey, why don't you come with?
It counts as training if we run to the bookstore!
<avatar_name>! Pass it here!
Nakayama! Close in on <avatar_name>!\nI'll take Nitta!
Right on!
Ugh, they blocked the line!
Hehe, not gonna make it easy for ya.
<avatar_name>, over here!
What?!
Huh?!
Yes! I did it! Nice pass, <avatar_name>!
Ugh. Didn't see that coming!
Your shot is a wonder to behold, Nishio.
Indeed! And that was a heck of an overlap\nyou did back there. Way to go.
Today's practice match went really well.
Even I can pull off plays like that if I train\nhard enough. I'm glad I was able to learn that,\neven if it was during practice.
Your pass was really good, though. You put it in\npretty much the perfect place from which to shoot.
You're pretty awesome, especially for a\nfirst-year. I feel like your skills are\non par with Nitta's.
Maybe next year or the one after, you'll get\nfeatured in a soccer magazine just like Tsubasa.
One day I might even put\na poster of you up in my room.
I look forward to　hanging yours up.
Don't you want a　poster of your own?
M-Mine? I'm not that kinda player...
I mean, that's the kind\nof player I want to become...
You know what?\nIt's too soon to be throwin' in the towel.
Heck, even today I saw\nthe results of my hard work.
Alright. I'm gonna work hard and become\nthe kind of player they put on posters!
But before that, we gotta do our best\nto defeat Nankatsu in this tournament!
And then they'll do a feature of us\non the magazine! I can see it now,\n"Otomo MS, the ones who took down Nankatsu!"







Haaah!
Hoo-rah!
That's it!
More of that!
Check it out!
There we go!
Push in!

Oh yeah!
I totally did it!
Alright! I did it!
I scored one for the team!
This goal belongs to all of us!
I...I did it!
How do you like that?!
We caught up!
Let's go all the way!
We're not here to lose!
The score's still tied!
Don't let down your guard!
We cannot give up!
Nice one!
Nice!
Great!
Oh boy...
What!
Stop that ball!
Nice pass!
Alright!
I got this!
Here I go!
I'm open!
Over here!
C'mon! Here!
Pass!
I'll go right past you!
Go! Go!
Here I go!
Practice let me do that, Tsubasa!
I haven't given up yet, Tsubasa!
I won't lose to you anymore, Hyuga!
Always amazing, always Hyuga.
I improved too, eh, Misaki?
You're just too good, Misaki!
They do say practice makes perfect!
I can't do anything against you!
Practice trumps natural talent!
You're too good, Misugi!
That ain't gonna work, Masao!
Gotta give you that one, Masao!
That ain't gonna work, Kazuo!
Gotta give you that one, Kazuo!
I won't lose to you, Nitta!
That's some speed, Nitta!
Is power all you got, Jito?!
Man you are strong!
I win this round, Soda!
Not losing next time, Soda!
I never lose a battle of courage!
You've got guts, Ishizaki!
A true player scores when needed!
Hey, <avatar_name>! You were really\nkillin' it out there in the last match!
To be honest, I was a little worried when\nyou were added to the team all of a sudden,\nbut not anymore!
Naturally.
I owe everyone for their guidance.
Ooh, we got a big shot here.
But actually, I kinda like that you're cocky.\nIt puts me at ease, somehow.
Makes sense.\nA fearless player is a dependable one.
Ha ha!\nWell, we're older so that's our job, right?
Yup! Don't be shy now, we're here for you!
Thanks Wakamatsu! I'll be counting on you!
I didn't mean you, Oda!
Anyway, you can see the sorta team we are, so no\nneed to be nervous. Let's strive hard together!
I'm looking forward to playing with you!
Hey, what're you doing, <avatar_name>?\nOh, summer homework?
Impressive. Practice and matches are one thing,\nbut you've also stayed focused on school.\nYou may be younger, but I really respect that.
But jeez, that looks difficult...
I remember that class! Want me to lend a hand?
Please!
There's no point unless I do it myself.
C'mon, you can't just do his homework for him,\nOda. He'll never learned anything like that.
Don't be such a wet blanket, Kato.
See? <avatar_name> gets it.
Way to be a buzzkill, Kato.
Oda. Think about it like soccer. People get\nbetter by pushing themselves harder, right?
Hmm... I guess...
Okay, here's what we'll do. I'll get\nsome studying done with you!
I'll have to take high school entrance exams\nnext year, so I figured I'd have to start\nstudying soon anyway.
I won't do your homework for you, but if you\never get stuck I can maybe give you advice.
That okay by you, too, Kato?
Yeah.
Heck, I might as well join in while we're at it.
Don't be shy now. Keep the questions coming.
Wait... Once we're done with this,\nwe've got even more practice waiting for us.
Our goal is to win every game of the league!\nAnd we'll do it together!
Here Wakamatsu!
It's yours now, Kaneda!
Over to you, <avatar_name>!
Oda!
Make it count, Oda!
Nice, <avatar_name>!
Nice, <avatar_name>!
Ha, we did it!
That was amazing! Our passes\nwere pretty much perfect!
You said it!
Especially, that last one, <avatar_name>.
You pinpointed the place I'd\nhave the easiest shot from.
I just know you that well!
You're our forward! I never doubted you!
Whoa, we haven't even been playing together\nthat long... You're really observant, huh?
Ha, flattery will get you nowhere!
But... you're absolutely right!
I knew you had potential, but I\nhadn't suspected you'd get THIS good.
I guess all that stands between us\nand winning the league is Nankatsu.
With you on our side, there's a real\npossibility of us winning this whole league.
But we need to keep at it all the way to the end!
Nothing's impossible for us!
Ow! Where'd that ball come from?\nToday's just not my day.
A-Are you okay?!
That's what you get for spacing out.
Y-Yeah, I'm fine. It's nothing.
H-Hey! Is that any way to talk to\nthe guy you just hit with a ball?!
Wait, aren't you...?
I think I've seen you in a match.\n<avatar_name>, right?
<avatar_name>, right?
I remember you from our match.\nYou play pretty well.
Huh. So you're out here training on your own?
Good use of your time, but seems a bit lonely...
I could practice with you, if you'd like.
Just give me a holler if you ever feel like it.\nLater!
Yo! How've you been, <avatar_name>?
Man, it's so hot these days. I'm dying here.
It's not that hot.
I mean, you grew up in snow country.
You're just used to it.
I grew up in the north so it's tough.
That's probably it.\nIt hardly ever gets this hot in Furano.
But the different climate just\nadds to the level of our training!
It's like...
"We train on a dirt field all year round,\nand you think you can beat us?!"
When it's winter at Furano MS,\nthe field is covered with snow,\nso we can't really practice outside.
We can use the gym, but we have to\nshare it with a bunch of other clubs,\nso it's not like we can use it just whenever.
And even when we do practice outside,\nwe only clear the snow around the goal,\nso we only get to practice kicks from that range.
And even then, the ground underneath gets all\nmuddy and slushy, and the footing is awful.
And sometimes it just starts snowing\nagain anyway, and we can't practice at all.
But there's something special\nabout where we're from, too.
Training in the snow without\ngood footing makes our legs strong.
And the cold may have been harsh,\nbut it made us tough.
And, well, we couldn't beat you guys, but being\nable to charge full steam ahead and still survive\nthis heat is good enough for me.
Good luck with the rest of your matches!
I bet you're thinking that we'll be\npushovers with no stamina because of the heat.\nWell, think again.
I can't wait to see the look on your\nface when we steamroll right over you!
Oh hey, it's you <avatar_name>.\nWhat brings you here today?
You said we could practice together!
I thought I'd let you practice with me.
Oh! I'm surprised you remembered.
Hey, ya don't hafta be condescending about it.
But I guess I did say I'd practice with you.\nYou really remembered, huh?
Thanks, man.
Then we're training together today!
When the ball gets taken, steal it back!
We're not done yet! Let's run this\nas many times as it takes you to get it!
Don't underestimate how\nstubborn we are up in Furano!
Man, that was a great workout.
You're pretty serious even in practice, huh?\nThat's why you keep getting better.\nWe're the same in Furano MS.
Ha ha, really feels like\nwe're birds of a feather.
But don't expect me to go\neasy on you in our match.
I can't wait for it!
Keep that up and you might even\nget chosen as a rep! Good luck!
Make it!
One more time!
Dang it! Next time for sure!
Alright! I did it!
Gah, you just never give up, do you Oda?
Hey, <avatar_name>! You see that?
What'd you think of that shot?
Amazing Oda! Nice shot!
Don't go giving up, Oda.
Ha ha! Well, thanks!
You don't need to tell me.
Obviously, the ideal is for every shot to land,\nbut I just can't always put it together.
Still, I'm the team's forward,\nso they're counting on me to score\nwhen they pass me the ball.
So instead I take each shot with the idea that\neven if it doesn't go in, I won't give up.\nThat's how I can live up to their expectations.
I learned that from Nationals.
<avatar_name>, someday you'll have to carry\nthe expectations of your teammates and fans, too.
So never give up, for the sake of everyone\nstanding beside and behind you, keep slingin'\nthe ball toward the net until it goes in.
That's what it means to be your team's striker!
Yo! How've you been, <avatar_name>?
Man, it's so hot these days. I'm dying here.
It's not that hot.
Growing up in snow country is tough.
I envy you guys. How can you stand this heat?
Sure, but when you come from somewhere up north\nlike Hokkaido or Akita, heat like this does a\nnumber on you.
All the more reason to tough it out though!
It's like...
"We train on a dirt field all year round,\nand you think you can beat us?!"
When it's winter at Furano MS,\nthe field is covered with snow,\nso we can't really practice outside.
We can use the gym, but we have to\nshare it with a bunch of other clubs,\nso it's not like we can use it just whenever.

Training in the snow without\ngood footing makes our legs strong.
And the cold may have been harsh,\nbut it made us tough.
And, well, we couldn't beat you guys, but being\nable to charge full steam ahead and still survive\nthis heat is good enough for me.
Good luck with the rest of your matches!
If they think teams from the cold north will have\nour energy sapped by the heat, they're in for a\nsurprise.
We might be in different groups, but let's both\nride this momentum and steamroll our opponents!
Oh hey, it's you <avatar_name>.\nWhat brings you here today?
You said we could practice together!
I thought I'd let you practice with me.
Oh! I'm surprised you remembered.
Hey, ya don't hafta be condescending about it.
But I guess I did say I'd practice with you.\nYou really remembered, huh?
Thanks, man.
Then we're training together today!
When the ball gets taken, steal it back!

Don't underestimate how\nstubborn we are up in Furano!
Man, that was a great workout.
You're pretty serious even in practice, huh?\nThat's why you keep getting better.\nWe're the same in Furano MS.
Ha ha, really feels like\nwe're birds of a feather.
But don't expect me to go\neasy on you in our match.
I can't wait for it!
Aw... I really wanted to face you in a match, but\nwe're in different groups so what can you do?
Hanawa came this far... Wouldn't it be a shame if\nyou didn't go all the way?
Keep that up and you might even\nget chosen as a rep! Good luck!



I mean, you grew up in snow country.
They're used to the heat because Kyushu is in the\nsouth. So unfair.
The heat sure does a number on you when you grew\nup somewhere cold.















You're probably thinking we'll be pushovers\nand burnout because of the heat.\nWe'll prove you wrong!
We'll be working even harder for that reason!















Hirado came this far... Wouldn't it be a shame if\nyou didn't go all the way?








Raaah!
Oh yeah!
Ah-ha!
Gotcha!
Take this!
Take that!
Here's my chance!























Captain!
It's up to you now!
Go for it!

Score!
Aw, yeah!
I'm done with regrets.
I was picked from among thousands!
You saw that, right?!
Not bad, eh?
Alright! We're back!
Time to kick our lead up a notch!
Don't count us out yet!
We're still tied!
Don't stress! We can still win this!
Don't give up!
Good one!
Boom!
That's the stuff!
Oh no...
What?!
Get 'em!
Nice pass!
There we go!
Leave it to me!
Full steam ahead!
Over here!
Hey, over here!
Pass me the ball!
Pass!
This is it, everyone!
Opportunity awaits!
Everyone move up!
I'm movin'!
Comin' through!
Can't stop me now!
Tsubasa! You know I wouldn't lose!
I get what Misugi sees in you, Tsubasa!
Hyuga! I'm through losin'!
Dang it! I thought I had that one!
You can't match my technique, Misaki!
You are good, Misaki!
Don't underestimate me, Matsuyama!
Urk! That's Hokkaido's Wild Eagle!
I... I beat Misugi?!
Ack! Misugi... Figures.
I win this time, Masao!
Well, aren't you fancy, Masao!
My time to shine, Kazuo!
Yeah, yeah, you're good, Kazuo!
See what I can do, Nitta?
Now I see why even Tsubasa had trouble!
Size isn't everything, Jito!
How did he ever get this strong?!
You don't have anything on me, Soda!
So, this is the famous Ace Killer?!
You've still got a ways to go, Ishizaki!
You're pretty dang good, Ishizaki!
I can read you from a mile away, Sanada!
I'd expect nothing less from Sanada!
How's that for power, Ichinose?!
You've gotten pretty good, Ichinose!
I'm 100% going to make this work for us!
You've certainly impressed me, <avatar_name>!\nThat dribble to shot just now was great!
But that you play so hard in matches only to give\nyour all again in morning practice sessions...\nIt's mind-blowing!
That's what it takes to be great.
It's nothing really!
Wanting to get better is important.
You've got so much energy!\nThat's really important!
I've gotta do my best these\ndays just to keep up with you!
I'm gonna go change, so I'll see you later!
Bring it on!
Take this!
Here I go!
Wha...?!
That movement...! Don't tell me!
That's right! Misugi's steps!
Your dribbling surprised me just now, Honma.
I can't perfectly mimic Misugi's dribbling,\nbut I thought I could incorporate at least\nsome of what he does into my game.
I've been working on it for awhile.
Misugi's technique... Makes sense.
You've been working hard, Honma!
Yeah, whenever I practice it,\nI'm reminded how much of a genius Misugi is.
It took a ton of effort to get those steps down.
I guess.
But that I am only kind of able to do it\nafter working so hard is a testament to how well\nMisugi does it.
It really served as a reminder\nof how great he is.
You're truly blessed to have been\nable to learn from Misugi, <avatar_name>.
Soak in as much as possible while you still can!\nAnything you can glean from him is absolutely\npriceless!
Here I come, <avatar_name>!
Ugh!
Ugh!
He did that to Honma?! And so easily?!
You've really improved, <avatar_name>!\nI get what Misugi sees in you.
That you could juke a player of my caliber\nso handily after such a short time...\nI totally didn't see that coming... literally.
Age doesn't matter in soccer.
I've been working hard!
You can say that again. I thought I knew that,\ntoo, but seeing you play highlights that truth\nso well.
It's true that you put in more effort than most.
Not even the third year students are sure if\nthey can survive Misugi's punishing practices.
The truth is that you're the person who\ninspired me to try to mimic his dribbling.
Seeing how hard you work made me think\nthat I haven't been working hard enough.
We won't have Misugi for the next match.\nWe'll have to beat Toho Academy on our own.
Of course, you know I'll\nbe giving it my all, too!
Misugi believes in you, so I'm counting\non you to contribute out there, too.
Of course, you know I'll do everything in\nmy power to win all of the league matches!
I'm counting on your skills out there!
Together, we'll help make\nMisugi's dream come true!
Try to stop my dribbling!
Take this!
Łoł!
Ngh!
That was too easy, Ichinose!
Darn it! One more time, Honma!
Alright! Play like you mean it!
Whew... I only managed to get the ball twice.
The last time was close...
I'll definitely get another chance tomorrow!
Hey, Ichinose! The coach wants to see you!
Okay! I'm on my way!
Alright, Honma! I'm heading back early.
I think I'll clean up and head back, too...
Huh?
You...
That jersey... Do you play for Furano?
That jersey... You must play for Toho.
That's right. You're that first-year\nfrom Furano... <avatar_name>, right?
That's right. You're that first-year from Toho...\n<avatar_name>, right?
I've seen you somewhere before.
Ah! Now I remember!
You're that first-year starter,\n<avatar_name>, right? I saw you in a match.
So what are you doing here of all places?\nPracticing?
So what are you doing here of all places?\nPracticing?
Of course!
I wanted a look at your dribbling.
I see. You're pretty passionate, huh.
What?! Really?! I-I see...
You're quite the student, aren't ya?\nThat's why you've been watching all this time.
We leave it all on the field every match,\neven if it's just a league exhibition.
So remember this and remember it well...\nMusashi MS is gonna stand atop the pile at\nthe end of this!
We leave it all on the field,\neven if it's just an unofficial league match.
We owe Toho Academy one for what happened in\nthe Tokyo tournament finals, so we're definitely\ngonna get you back this time!
Do your best in the remaining matches! Now\nthat you've beaten us, you're sure to win it all!
Later!
Ah, <avatar_name>. Perfect timing!
Sorry to ask, but I was wondering if you could\ndribble against me a bit. It'd be a huge help!
Alright, here we go. Ready... Set... Go!
Oof...\nI guess I'm not a match for you at dribbling.
Of course not.
Why are you doing this?
Hey... No need to be mean.
Well... I wanted to try something.
You might already know this, but the Musashi MS\ncaptain, Misugi, has been famous since elementary\nschool.
It showed in the match between Musashi FC\nand Nankatsu SC with Tsubasa Ozora.
With rain pouring down in the second half, Misugi\ndribbled his way into the Nankatsu side of the\nfield.
While dribbling on the wet field, Misugi quickly\nput distance between himself and the Nankatsu\nplayers.
The speed of his feet was unreal,\nbut his style is too difficult for me.
Anyway, sorry to bother you.\nLet's meet again sometime!
Oh? You're...<avatar_name>, right?
Practicing now of all times really\ntells me how passionate you are.
I could say the same of you.
Well, I'm a first-year!
I guess.
I just thought I had to do\nwhat I can to support Misugi.
I understand how you feel.\nKeep that passion intact when you get older.
Oh, yeah... Misugi thinks highly of you.\nHe said your abilities are on par with\nthose of Tsubasa Ozora.
Oh, yeah... Misugi thinks highly of you.\nHe says your technical precision is similar\nto that of Taro Misaki.
Speaking of which, do you know of Misaki?\nHe played for Nankatsu SC.\nHis technical prowess was second to none.
I have confidence in my dribbling, but I\nfeel it's a strong point for you, as well.
That's right. Misugi thinks highly of you.\nHe said you were a rising star.
I'm rooting for you, too.\nI can sense your enthusiasm.
But that changes when we're on the field.
We'll make it one to remember, <avatar_name>!
I envy the reps,\nbut I understand where my ability is at.
But in your case, with Misugi having your back,\nI'm sure you'll be chosen to represent Japan.
I have high hopes for you, <avatar_name>!
So let's practice together a bit.
You're not going anywhere!
I'm next!
I can read you from a mile away!
Hey <avatar_name>, what's up?
With that dribble you could cut in...
That juke past two players was amazing!
Well, I'm not saying I couldn't\ncut to and through the center...
But I can work from the edge of the field, too.
I'm happy to hear that.
When you're on the line, all of your\nteammates and opponents are on the same side,\nso you only need to look to that one side.
If you only have to be aware of one direction,\nyou can focus much more.
You should try some line play this time.\nI think you understand what I'm trying to say.
The reason we won the last Toho Academy\nmatch is because of you, <avatar_name>.
When Misugi went down, we wouldn't have\nbeen able to play if you hadn't urged us on.
Because of your words, we played as hard as\nwe could and got into that "how we do battle"\nmentality.
We'll pass that mindset down to the next team\nand get into the Nationals next year!
Don't aim so low!\nWe're going to dominate the country!
The sky's the limit with you onboard!\nI believe in you, <avatar_name>!
Try to stop my dribbling!
Go!
Łoł!
Ngh!
That was too easy, Ichinose!
Darn it! One more time, Honma!
Alright! Play like you mean it!
Whew... I only managed to get the ball twice.
The last time was close...
I'll get an extra one tomorrow! You'll see!
Hey, Ichinose! The coach wants to see you!
Okay! I'm on my way!
Alright, Honma! I'm heading back early.
I think I'll clean up and head back, too...
Hm?
You...
That jersey... Do you play for Furano?
That jersey... You must play for Toho.
That jersey... You're one of Hanawa's.
You must be that first-year from Furano...\n<avatar_name>, right?
You must be that first-year from Toho...\n<avatar_name>, right?
You must be that first-year from Hanawa...\n<avatar_name>, right?
I've seen you somewhere before.
Ah! Now I remember!
You're that first-year starter,\n<avatar_name>, right? I saw you in a match.
So what are you doing here of all places?\nPracticing?
So what are you doing here of all places?\nPracticing?
Of course!
I wanted a look at your dribbling.
I see. You're pretty passionate, huh.
What?! Really?! I-I see...
You're quite the student, aren't ya?\nThat's why you've been watching all this time.
We leave it all on the field every match,\neven if it's just a league exhibition.
So remember this and remember it well...\nMusashi MS is gonna stand atop the pile at\nthe end of this!
We leave it all on the field,\neven if it's just an unofficial league match.
We owe Toho Academy one for what happened in\nthe Tokyo tournament finals, so we're definitely\ngonna get you back this time!
Nothing like passion to help you improve at\nsoccer.
Well, good luck!
Do your best in the remaining matches! Now\nthat you've beaten us, you're sure to win it all!
See ya later!
Oh? You're...<avatar_name>, right?
Practicing now of all times really tells me how\npassionate you are.
I could say the same of you.
Well, I am a first-year!
Ya got me.
I just thought I had to do\nwhat I can to support Misugi.
I understand how you feel.\nKeep that passion intact when you get older.
Oh, yeah... Misugi thinks highly of you.\nHe said your abilities are on par with\nthose of Tsubasa Ozora.
Oh, yeah... Misugi thinks highly of you.\nHe says your technical precision is similar\nto that of Taro Misaki.
Speaking of which, do you know of Misaki?\nHe played for Nankatsu SC.\nHis technical prowess was second to none.
I have confidence in my dribbling, but I\nfeel it's a strong point for you, as well.
That's right. Misugi thinks highly of you.\nHe said you were a rising star.
I'm rooting for you, too.\nI can sense your enthusiasm.
Don't expect me to go easy on you\nin matches though.\nGet ready for me 'cause I'll be going all out!
We'll make it one to remember, <avatar_name>!
I envy the reps,\nbut I understand where my ability is at.
But in your case, with Misugi having your back,\nI'm sure you'll be chosen to represent Japan.
I have high hopes for you, <avatar_name>!
So let's practice together a bit.
















Going by your jersey, you're from Hirado.




You must be that first-year from Hirado...\n<avatar_name>, right?























I was hoping to face you in a match,\nbut it seems we're in different groups.
Keep it up, <avatar_name>.\nAt this rate, you're sure to become a rep.
I've got high hopes for you!




Try to stop my dribbling!
Take this!
Łoł!
Ngh!
That was too easy, Ichinose!
Darn it! One more time, Honma!
Alright! Play like you mean it!
Whew... I only managed to get the ball twice.
The last time was close...
I'm sure you'll get it done tomorrow!
Hey, Ichinose! The coach wants to see you!
Okay! I'm on my way!
Alright, Honma! I'm heading back early.
I think I'll clean up and head back, too...
Huh?
You...
That jersey... Do you play for Furano?
That jersey... You must play for Toho.
Judging from your jersey, I take it you're\none of Nankatsu's.
That's right. You're that first-year\nfrom Furano... <avatar_name>, right?
That's right. You're that first-year from Toho...\n<avatar_name>, right?
That's right. You're that first-year\nfrom Nankatsu... <avatar_name>, right?
I've seen you somewhere before.
Ah! Now I remember!
You're that first-year starter,\n<avatar_name>, right? I saw you in a match.
So what are you doing here of all places?\nPracticing?
So what are you doing here of all places?\nPracticing?
Of course!
I wanted a look at your dribbling.
I see. You're pretty passionate, huh.
What?! Really?! I-I see...
You're quite the student, aren't ya?\nThat's why you've been watching all this time.
We leave it all on the field every match,\neven if it's just a league exhibition.
So remember this and remember it well...\nMusashi MS is gonna stand atop the pile at\nthe end of this!

Well, good luck!
You beat us, so I know you'll win your last game\ntoo!
Do your best in the remaining matches! Now\nthat you've beaten us, you're sure to win it all!
Later!
Oh? You're...<avatar_name>, right?
Practicing now of all times really\ntells me how passionate you are.

Speaking of which, do you know of Misaki?\nHe played for Nankatsu SC.\nHis technical prowess was second to none.
I know we're on opposite sides, but I gotta admit,\nGolden Duo is a pretty slick name for your combo\nwith Tsubasa.
I have confidence in my dribbling, but I\nfeel it's a strong point for you, as well.
That's right. Misugi thinks highly of you.\nHe said you were a rising star.
I'm rooting for you, too.\nI can sense your enthusiasm.
But that changes when we're on the field.
We'll make it one to remember, <avatar_name>!
Good luck, <avatar_name>!\nI'm sure you'll be representing Japan in no time!
I envy the reps,\nbut I understand where my ability is at.
But in your case, with Misugi having your back,\nI'm sure you'll be chosen to represent Japan.
I have high hopes for you, <avatar_name>!

Try to stop my dribbling!
Go!
Łoł!
Ngh!
That was too easy, Ichinose!
Darn it! One more time, Honma!
Alright! Play like you mean it!
Whew... I only managed to get the ball twice.
The last time was close...
I'll definitely get another chance tomorrow!
Hey, Ichinose! The coach wants to see you!
Okay! I'm on my way!
Alright, Honma! I'm heading back early.
I think I'll clean up and head back, too...
Huh?
You...
That jersey... Do you play for Furano?
That jersey... You must play for Toho.
Going by your jersey, you're from Otomo.
You must be that first-year from Furano...\n<avatar_name>, right?
You must be that first-year from Toho...\n<avatar_name>, right?
That's right. You're that first-year\nfrom Otomo... <avatar_name>, right?

Oh yeah!
That's what I'm talkin' about!
Out of countless others, I was chosen!
Nailed it!
No more time for sad thoughts!
Hope you didn't miss that!
Wham!
Yes! It's all downhill from here!
Get ready to be left in the dust!
Now, you've got our attention!
This doesn't change a thing!
We can't get sloppy!
No backing down!
Now that was a solid play!
Awesome!
That's how we do it!
Oh, this is bad!
No way!
Stop them!
Great pass!
Got it!
There we go!
Witness me!
Come on!
Here!
I'm waiting!
Open!
I am unstoppable!
Can't stop me now!
Like a speeding bullet!
Tsubasa! Get outta my lane!
I get what Misugi sees in you, Tsubasa!
Hyuga! You can't beat me!
Ugh! I did not want to lose to him!
Heh, is that it, Misaki?
Wow, Misaki... You're good!
Don't underestimate me, Matsuyama!
Man, you don't give up, Matsuyama!
I... I actually beat Misugi?!
Ack! Misugi... No surprise there.
Not bad, eh, Masao?
Not half bad, Masao!
Pretty good, eh, Kazuo?
Okay, not bad, Kazuo!
Nitta! Now you know what I can do!
Wow, Nitta. Who knew?
Hey, Jito! The bigger they are...
Is he even human?!
Heh! You won't slow me down, Soda!
So, this is Soda, the Ace Killer?!
Ishizaki, come on... What was that?!
Ishizaki?! You gotta be kidding me!
This is what I'm about, Honma!
Not bad! Not bad at all, Honma!
You see that, Ichinose? That's my power!
Ichinose... I'm impressed!
I won't waste the chance Misugi gave me!
Here I come, <avatar_name>!
Hey, nice one!
Heading is what I do best, and I know I'm better\nthan anyone, but what you just did was pretty\nnice, too.
I'm comin' for ya, Sanada!
I've got a long way to go.
Don't speak too soon!
But hearing that fires me up!
You're too humble.\nA little more confidence wouldn't hurt ya.
Alright, then.\nI think I'll let you practice with me.
Honma! I'm gonna run and get changed!\nI'll be right back to practice!
Alright! I'm waiting!
Here I come, Sanada!
C'mon!
Not today!
Like I'd lose!
Tak!
Your aerial assault has gotten stronger, Sanada.
Yeah, it looks like your\nheading is even better, too.
Headers are where my head's at, so I try\nand find ways to use them as often as I can.
I'm not about to lose!
You've been really working hard, Sanada!
I feel the same!
If you say so!
You've put in so much effort, and come so far,\nbut I'm not gonna lose to you!
It's not only us. I'm sure that Misugi\nis also reassured by your improvement.
We needta keep getting better if we're\ngonna win each and every league match!
Another goal!
Darn it!
Don't let a defender shoot!
Incredible...
That shot was amazing, <avatar_name>!
Everyone's helped me get good!
It's because of all the training!
You're too humble! You have serious talent!
Yeah. Everyone knows how good you are.
Misugi was the only one who knew from\nthe start just how good you could be!
We won't have Misugi for the next match.\nYou're the one who will have to lead us\nto victory over Toho Academy.
I'm gonna run until my legs give out.\nSo prove Misugi had the right idea about you\nand let's win!
Let's do our best to win all of\nthe league matches, <avatar_name>!
Together, we'll make Misugi's\ndreams of triumph come true!
Honma! Pass!
Sure!
Here we go!
Yes!
Nice shot, Sanada! Nice going!
Tak!
Hey! The coach is calling a meeting! Gather up!
Okay! Coming!
Oh...
Hmm?
Who are you?
Wait... Is that a Furano jersey?\nI think I've seen you somewhere before...
Oh yeah, that's right! You're <avatar_name>!\nYou're the first-year regular, right?
Wait... Is that a Toho Academy jersey?\nI think I've seen you somewhere before...
Oh yeah, that's right. You're <avatar_name>!\nYou're the other first-year regular besides\nSawada, right?
I'm kidding. You're <avatar_name>, right?\nI remember playing against you.
So what do you want?
I wanted to see you shoot.
I wanted to practice with you.
Huh?! Really?
You're pretty bold!
But unfortunately, I have a meeting to attend.
But come back again sometime! Be seein' ya!
Oh, sorry about before, <avatar_name>.
So... I hate to ask, but... Could you\ncross in my direction? Much appreciated!
I'm counting on you!
Here goes an overhead... Łoł!
Owww... I guess that was a bit too much...
Overhead kick practice?
What's wrong with headers?
Well, kinda...
Nothing wrong with headers, but...
You might already know this, but the Musashi MS\ncaptain, Misugi, is a master of the overhead\nkick.
He's had it in his repertoire since elementary\nschool. He and Tsubasa make it look easy.
That's why eventually...
Well, I've been practicing,\nbut it's pretty difficult.
But I won't give up.\nEven if it's not quite as perfect as Misugi's!
Owww! My hip. I guess it's time to go back.
Sorry to bother you. Let's talk again, sometime.
Hey there, <avatar_name>!
You must really love soccer\nto be practicing now of all times.
Eh? Now of all times?
Wanna practice, Sanada?
Eh? You still wanna keep going?
No worries. I know how ya feel. When I was a\nkid I'd be outside kicking the ball around until\nmy folks yelled at me to come inside.
Man, that takes me back...\nAnyway, I'm in. Idziemy!
I like the sound of that.
Okay! Let's practice a bit!
*phew* You make me work for those headers.\nDefinitely not used to that.
Guess I shouldn't be surprised after\nyou held your own against Misugi.
He even praised your dribbling and passing.\nYou've got a real knack for the sport.
Hard to believe you're just a first-year.
It's strange. There's something about\nyou that makes me wanna root for you.
That's not to say I'll take it\neasy on you in a match, though!
We'll make it one to remember, <avatar_name>!
I have a feeling that you'd look good\nin a Japanese national uniform.
Good luck, <avatar_name>!
Anywho, let's keep goin'!
Hey, <avatar_name>, there's something I wanted\nto tell you about the practice match earlier.
Hey, <avatar_name>, I took a look at your practice\nearlier, and there's something I wanted to pass\non.
You're taking too long to shoot when you get the\nball in the penalty box. You gotta do better.
Opponents close in really quickly in there.\nWith every passing moment,\nyou're losing your chance at a clean shot.
So, I should just hurry up and shoot?
Okay, well, what should I do?
No, no, you have to shoot properly.
The point is to not take your sweet time.\nKick fast and hard.
It's simple. Kick fast and hard.
Let me show you the trick to it. Pay attention.\nFirst, you really have to look at\nwhat's happening below the knees...
...and that's it. Next time, really think about\nwhat you're doing. I think you'll figure it out.
You're an important part of Musashi's team.\nKeep learning from the upperclassmen and\nkeep improving your game!
Wanna know why I'm teaching\nanother school's player?
I know we're not teammates or anything.\nIt was just buggin' me!
Well, good luck!
Honma! Pass!
Yep!
Boom boom!
Yes!
Nice shot, Sanada! That was a good combo!
Tak!
Hey! The coach is calling a meeting! Gather up!
Okay! Let's go.
Okay...
What?
Who are you?
Wait... Is that a Furano jersey?\nI think I've seen you somewhere before...
Oh yeah, that's right! You're <avatar_name>!\nYou're the first-year starter, right?
Wait... Is that a Toho Academy jersey?\nI think I've seen you somewhere before...
Oh yeah, that's right. You're <avatar_name>!\nYou're the other first-year regular besides\nSawada, right?
Wait... Is that a Hanawa jersey?\nI think I've seen you somewhere before...
Oh yeah, that's right! You're <avatar_name>!\nYou're the first-year starter, right?
I'm kidding. You're <avatar_name>, right?\nI remember playing against you.
So what do you want?
I wanted to see you shoot.
I wanted to practice with you.
Huh?! Really?
You're pretty bold!
But unfortunately, I have a meeting to attend.
Come back again sometime! Be seein' ya!
Hey there, <avatar_name>!
You must really love soccer to be practicing at\nthis hour.
What? It's this late already?
Wanna practice, Sanada?
Whoa, don't tell me you lost track of time.
No worries. I know how ya feel. When I was a\nkid I'd be outside kicking the ball around until\nmy folks yelled at me to come inside.
Man, that takes me back...\nAnyway, I'm in. Idziemy!
I like the sound of that.
Okay! Let's practice a bit!
Phew... Your headers are giving mine a run for\ntheir money. Definitely not used to that.
Guess I shouldn't be surprised after\nyou held your own against Misugi.
He even praised your dribbling and passing.\nYou've got a real knack for the sport.
Hard to believe you're just a first-year.
It's strange. There's something about\nyou that makes me wanna root for you.
Well, it's a different story during the match.\nI have every intention of crushing you out there,\nso you best be ready!
With your skills, I'm sure you'll make rep.\nGood luck!
I have a feeling the Japanese national uniform\nwill suit you just fine.
Good luck, <avatar_name>!
Anywho, let's keep goin'!











Wait... Is that a Hirado jersey?\nI think I've seen you somewhere before...























You keep that up, and they'll definitely pick you\nas a rep given your skills.


Honma! Pass!
Sure!
Here we go!
Yes!
Nice shot, Sanada! Nice going!
Tak!
Hey! The coach is calling a meeting! Gather up!
Okay! Coming!
Oh...

Here's to never getting crushed again!
The game starts now!
Don't mind us... Just taking the lead!
It's not over 'til it's over!
Let's get that lead back!
Get your heads in the game!
Too early to be givin' up!
I like the look of that!
Solid!
Keep it up!
Oh boy...
What in the...?!
Don't let 'em through!
Now that was a pass!
Go time!
All over it!
I'm on it!
I'm open!
Over here!
Hey, I'm open!
Hey! Pass!
Skills to pay the bills!
Can't touch this!
There's no stoppin' me!
I got moves, too, Tsubasa!
I get what Misugi sees in you, Tsubasa!
Like you could beat me, Hyuga!
Ugh! Losing to that guy!
My win, Misaki!
I didn't give you enough credit, Misaki!
Remember this moment, Matsuyama!
I'm impressed, Matsuyama!
I just outplayed Misugi...!
Figures I'd lose to you, Misugi!
That won't be enough to beat me, Masao!
Ack! Nicely done, Masao!
Try harder, Kazuo!
Gah! Well done, Kazuo!
Should've known better, Nitta!
Nitta... I don't repeat mistakes!
Soccer doesn't work like fighting, Jito!
Such incredible power!
Better luck next time, Soda!
Now I know why they call you Ace Killer!
You thought that would do it, Ishizaki!?
Ishizaki! Why, I oughta...!
How about that, Honma? Not bad, eh?
Just you wait, Honma. Next time!
I've got you all figured out, Sanada!
Dang, you saw through my moves, Sanada!
I believe in you, Honma!
Whoa, <avatar_name>, look at you go!
You've got good control landing\nthose long passes so accurately.
You kill it during matches. You practice super\nhard, too. No wonder Misugi saw something in you!
Well, I don't want to disappoint him.
You guys work hard, too!
Right. We're counting on you, too,\nso keep up the good work!
As if we weren't?
You're right, though. We'd be some sad\nupperclassmen if we were showed up by a\nfirst-year!
Alright! Today, I'm gonna practice really\nhard. You're not outrunning me today!
Time to get changed. Catch ya later!
Here! Ichinose!
Go!
Honma! Pass it to Sanada on the right!
Got it!
Sanada! Pass to your 5 o'clock!
Kay!
Got it!
Woo! I did it!
Nice calls back there, Ichinose!
For a second, I thought you were Misugi.
That's kind of you to say, but seriously,\nit's not that big a deal.
No, but for real, when did you get\nsuch a good feel for play calling?
Until now, we've been depending on\nMisugi's playmaking a little too much.\nSo I've been trying to study up.
Aiming to be a playmaker yourself?
You really study hard, Ichinose!
Oh, no, I'm a forward. I'm not\nthinking of anything major like that.
I just thought I'd try to find a way\nto make Misugi's load a little lighter.
See? You're not the only one\nputting in an effort, <avatar_name>.
Even if I can't reach Misugi's level, I wanna\nbe able to think one or two plays ahead and keep\neveryone movin' together.
<avatar_name> we're all doing\nthe best we can, of course.
But I'm sure you're the one\nMisugi's expecting the most from.
You watch his back, and the\nrest of us will watch yours!
Okay, here we go!
Sanada! Pass back!
Huh?
Pass back and keep running!
Oh, okay!
<avatar_name>! I'm counting on you!
Tak! Got it!
Wow. That played out perfectly.
<avatar_name>! That long shot was awesome!
<avatar_name> you've seriously improved.\nThat pass back there was as good as Misugi's!
Even calling the shots, I didn't think\nyou'd kick with as much control as you did.
Nah, it was a lucky shot.
Just did it like Misugi taught me.
Lucky shot, my butt!
I've seen how hard you've been working.
That may be so, but that's not something you\ncan pull off just because someone showed you.
I know you worked at it. And the way you put\nyour practice to use in play is somethin' else.
When I see you workin' so hard it makes me feel\nlike us third years haven't been doing as much\nas we could've.
Maybe if we'd spent the last two and a half\nyears bustin' our butts like you,\nwe could've taken Nationals.
No sense dwelling on the past, I suppose.
All we can do now is try our hardest,\nso we can sweep through the Junior Hero League.
We have to get good enough that we can\nbeat Toho Academy even without Misugi!
I'm gonna give it all I've got,\nbut I'm counting on you out there, too!
<avatar_name>, I'm counting on your abilities.
Of course, you know I'll be\ngiving it my all, too!
Together, we'll help make\nMisugi's dream come true!
Hey, aren't you... <avatar_name>?
It is you. I saw you in a match recently.\nYou did pretty well out there.
You did a number on us that match.\nHow could I forget?
Anyway, it's pretty impressive you're\nout practicing on your own this early.
Looks like, you're honing your long shots.\nI can see why. Your accuracy needs work.
Well, care to show me then?
How can I get more accurate?
Why not? My passes are pretty accurate,\nif I do say so myself.
Let's see... I'll show you how I do it.
You ready? Watch closely!
Something like that. Hope it helps!
Alright, well, I'm off.\nWas in the middle of a run.
See ya, <avatar_name>!
(I see. You can use a combination play\nlike that to get out of side pressure.)
Yo, <avatar_name>! Didn't think I'd see you here.
Studying some tactics?
Doing some scouting?
Yep, you hit the nail on the head.
Well, there is that, but my main reason for\nbeing here is to take in some tactics.
I think you already know, but our captain\nMisugi's shot calling during matches is\nsheer perfection.
It's not good to just depend on that, though.\nThat's why I thought to watch from afar and\nstudy in my own way.
Our captain Misugi's shot calling\nduring matches is sheer perfection.
If we move the ball exactly how he says,\nwe're guaranteed to control the pace of the game,\nand score way more.
On the other hand, that means without him,\nwe can be dead in the water.
That's why I'm studying in my own way,\nby watching matches from afar like this.
The thing is, with this perspective, it's easy to\nsee how the ball should be moving. It's making\nthose decisions on the pitch that's the problem.
How the heck does Misugi see it?
Oh yeah, <avatar_name>,\nwhy don't you watch a match with me?
Let's study this together!
Yo, <avatar_name> working hard\nthis morning, too, huh?
I will say, you've gotten way better at\ncontrolling the ball. All that practicing\nreally shows!
Let's have a match, Ichinose!
Thanks!
Well, can't turn that down, now can I? You're on!
Alright, let's have ourselves a little match!
Okay. That's the last one!
A tie... I was positive I'd win.
You've really improved a heck\nof a lot in a really short time.
I expect no less from the one who bested Misugi.\nYou and your terrifying soccer sense.
We really struggled with how well\nyou controlled your passes.
Just goes to show you the importance of hard\nwork. I still have some work of my own to do.
You know, seeing you work so hard,\nit makes me a bit of a fan of yours.
Not during matches, of course.\nThat's a different story!
You best be ready <avatar_name>!\nMusashi MS is gonna win!
With your skills, you might even become\na representative alongside Misugi!
Show me you've got what it takes, <avatar_name>!
Alright, I'm done running.\nI'll practice with you!
<avatar_name>, good timing.\nPractice with me, will ya?
Here!
So how was that pass just now?\nWas it hard to shoot?
It was just right.
Could've been a little faster.
Well, that's good.
Faster, huh?
The thing is, I'm working on the\nlast pass that connects to the shot.
I think you know...
In the Tokyo finals, Misugi risked it all to\ncreate an opening, just for Honma's shot to get\nblocked by Wakashimazu.
And likely it was all because of my last pass.
If my pass had been sharper and more accurate,\nthere's no way Wakashimazu could've blocked\nHonma's shot, and we'd've tied!
During the Tokyo finals in our match against you,\nMisugi risked his life to create an opening near\nthe end of the match.
But due to my last pass,\nmaybe it was all for nothing.
If my pass had been sharper and more accurate,\nthere's no way Wakashimazu could've blocked\nHonma's shot, and we'd've scored!
You probably don't know this, but my pass\nmight've been the reason we lost the finals\nat the Tokyo games.
We had a chance toward the end of the match.\nIf my pass had been sharper and more accurate,\nHonma might've scored and tied the game!
Listen, <avatar_name>. The pass that connects to\nthe shot is just as important as the shot itself.
Whether it can be turned into a shot,\nhow easy it is to shoot, and how hard\nit is to defend against...
If you pass with these things in mind, shots\nwill become more effective. Remember that.
Yo, <avatar_name> working hard\nthis morning, too, huh?
I will say, you've gotten way better at\ncontrolling the ball. All that practicing\nreally shows!
Let's have a match, Ichinose!
Thank you!

With your skills, you might even become\na representative alongside Misugi!

Show me you've got what it takes, <avatar_name>!
Alright, I'm done running.\nI'll practice with you!







Haaah!
Woohoo!

I did it!
Score!
Bear witness to Meiwa's soccer!
Right into the net!
I totally scored!
Did you see that?!
I'll score a goal off any keeper.
We're now caught up!
Let's give it our 110%!
Don't even think about losing!
How is the score still tied?!
Don't get careless out there!
Don't give up on our soccer style!
Nice one!
Nice!
There you go!
Aw, come on...
What!
Stop them!
Nice pass!
Alright!
I got this!
Here I go!
I'm open!
Over here!
C'mon! Here!
Pass!
Like I'd lose!
Don't underestimate me!
Here I go!
I won't lose, Tsubasa!
Tsubasa. Next time, I'll definitely...
I will not lose to you, Hyuga!
Dammit Hyuga! That was nice!
I've gotten better, too, Misaki!
Amazing technique, Misaki!
Today belongs to us again, Matsuyama!
Matsuyama! Sly as always!
I'm not gonna hold back, Misugi!
Where'd you pick that up, Misugi?!
This one's mine, Masao!
Why you... Masao!
Ain't I great, Kazuo?
I can't believe... Kazuo!
No finesse, Nitta!
Do you have boosters in those cleets?!
Soccer's requires more than a big body!
Jito! You're a beast!
I've got more spirit than you, Soda!
That razor sure is sharp indeed!
I win this time, Ishizaki!
Oh no?! That Ishizaki...
Takeshi! You're way too obvious.
Takeshi, you've grown...
Come on! You represent Meiwa!
C'mon now, you can't just intrude\non our practice like this.
Aren't you from Toho Academy?\n<avatar_name>, right?
Wait, you're <avatar_name>! From Toho Academy!
How could I forget you after you\ngot us good in our match?
I think you were... <avatar_name>, right?
Yeah, I knew it.
I remember hearing that Toho Academy\nadded another first-year to their line-up,\nso I looked you up.
You're... <avatar_name>, right?
You did pretty well in our match,\nfor a first-year. That stood out to me.
Who were you again? Umm... <avatar_name>, I think?
I think I've seen you play before... not sure\nwhen. But I remember you playing pretty well.
Anyway, since you came all this way to interrupt\nour training, I'm guessing you wanted something?
I want to challenge you, Sawaki.
I want to train with you, Sawaki.
Ooh, a challenge, huh? Sounds like fun.
Fine, I accept.
Sawaki...?
I know, I know, we're in the middle\nof team practice.
I can't do it today,\nbut come back some other time.
Well, I'm glad you're interested,\nbut you sure picked the worst time to ask.
Sorry <avatar_name>, but Meiwa Higashi's in the\nmiddle of team practice. If you want to talk\nto Sawaki, you'll have to come back later.
And there you have it, straight from\nthe captain's mouth. Today's no good.
Anyway, drop by again some time!
Okay, we're done scouting our next opponents.
Did you manage to get a recording\nof them this time?
Yeah, it went perfect-ish. Probably.
So are we good or not...?
Hey, <avatar_name>. Did you see that last match?
Doing some recon?
I was on a run.
Yeah. The team in that match just now\nare going to be our next opponents.
Good to keep at it.
We were doing reconnaissance. The team in that\nmatch just now is who we're up against next.
Actually, we've done this before, too,\nbut the captain screwed up with the camera,\nso we couldn't get a recording.
I said I was sorry!
Yeah, it's cool. Today's match looked like it'll\nbe much more useful than the last one anyway.
But man, it's so hot today. I need a drink.
That's for sure.\nHow about we go buy something nearby?
Good idea. Come with us, <avatar_name>.
Why waste this chance? We can talk\nabout soccer while we get refreshed!
Finally. I've been waiting for you, <avatar_name>.
Luckily, I've got time today.\nTraining, challenge, whatever, let's do it!
Phew... I'm beat.
Okay, let's wrap this up with a one-on-one!\nGo go go!
Take this!
Have a taste of the Meiwa Higashi Sliding Squad!
You can't catch me!
I'm a forward on one of the top four teams\nfrom Nationals! It won't be that easy!
Wow, I may have won that last one,\nbut it could've gone either way.
It's hard to believe you're a first-year.
Plus, you're on the same team as Takeshi.\nToho Academy's going to be unstoppable next year.
Your school's team must feel comfy\nknowing you'll be in charge next year.
So anyway, you aiming to get picked as a rep?
Of course!
I'm focusing on the league for now.
As good as you are,\nI'd be shocked if you weren't picked.
Putting the team first, eh?
Still, doing well in your matches just puts\nyou that much closer to getting chosen.
I'm aiming for it, but I was\nthinking it might be a little tricky.
Still, even if we're not picked this year,\nthere's always high school, and then later\nas a pro. We've got a long road ahead of us.
So let's keep doing our\nbest to polish our skills!
Could you pass that on to Hyuga, Takeshi,\nWakashimazu, and the rest? No matter what,\nthey're still my old teammates from Meiwa FC.
We're all old war buddies who had\npassed through the boot camp of Coach Kira.
I'll be keeping an eye on you guys.
Could you pass that on to your captain, too?
If we ever get matched up in high school,\nmy team's gonna win!
Alright, later! Good luck!
No no no, that's way too shallow! You first\nand second-years don't know how to tackle!
How can we call ourselves the Meiwa Higashi\nSliding Squad with weak moves like that!
Listen up! Keep up the speed and\nkeep charging the ball, no matter what!
There's always a risk when it's right in the\nother guy's legs, but if you don't take that risk\nyou'll NEVER steal the ball!
Don't worry about hitting their feet by accident.\nGo fast, go hard, and get that ball!
This stuff is important you guys! Never forget it!
It's called a squad because it's a squad! We need\neveryone to be on the same page!
One last thing, keep the strategy straight in\nyour head. The name of the game is offense!
We aren't some wussy defensive team. We tackle\nsharp so we can score! Never forget that!
Tak!
Okay guys, remember this strategy!\nNext year we're dominating at Nationals!
Tak!
Meiwa Higashi's Sliding Squad is as\nbrutal as ever. What a playstyle.
If you're going to take over next year,\nthey'll be a team to watch out for.
So pay close attention to their training.\nMaybe it'll help when you have to fight them.
Looks like they're making their playstyle\ninto a school tradition.
Which means they'll be a formidable opponent\nat the tournament next year.\nThey may be your biggest obstacle.
Study them while you have the chance.\nIt can't hurt to have a good bead on them.
(I guess you've really absorbed\nCoach Kira's teachings, huh Sawaki.)
<avatar_name>, that playstyle they use\nstarted with me, at Meiwa FC.
I'll have to teach you that later.\nAnything that even has a chance of helping\nToho Academy is worth pursuing!
Anything that even has a chance of helping\nToho Academy is worth pursuing!
C'mon now, you can't just intrude\non our practice like this.
Aren't you from Toho Academy?\n<avatar_name>, right?

How could I forget you after you\ngot us so good in our match?
I think you were... <avatar_name>, right?
Yeah, I knew it.
I remember hearing that Toho Academy added another\nfirst-year to their line-up, so I checked you out.
You're... <avatar_name>, right?
You did pretty well in our match,\nfor a first-year. That stood out to me.
Wait, you're <avatar_name>, from Hanawa,\naren't you?
It's you! <avatar_name> from Hanawa!
How could I forget you after you\ngot us so good in our match?
Who were you again? Umm... <avatar_name>, was it?
I think I've seen you play before... not sure\nwhen. But I remember you playing pretty well.

What are you doing, Sawaki?
I know, I know, we're in the middle\nof group practice.

There's always a risk when it's right in the\nother guy's legs, but if you don't take that risk\nyou'll NEVER steal the ball!
Don't worry about hitting their feet by accident.\nGo fast, go hard, and get that ball!

Anything that even has a chance of helping\nToho Academy is worth pursuing!
Meiwa Higashi's Sliding Squad\nreally is incredible.
Not just how much force their tackles have,\nbut also how well they work together.
They make you feel targeted so bad.\nThey really put the pressure on.
<avatar_name>, if Meiwa Higashi pass down that\ntechnique, you might have to face it next year.
That's right. You better start thinking of\nstrategies to counteract it.
Get a real good look at their practice.\nIt's bound to be of use next year!

Wait, you're <avatar_name>, from Hirado,\naren't you?
Wait, you're <avatar_name> from Hirado!
























Meiwa Higashi's Sliding Squad really packs\na wallop.
Who comes up with the idea of using so many\npowerful tackles all at once, anyway?
It takes so much out of you to avoid just one,\nhaving to deal with multiple tackles is a\nnightmare.
If Meiwa Higashi is working hard on this,\nit means they plan to use it next year, too.
It'll be in your best interest to be ready for it,\nSano, <avatar_name>.
You heard him. Pay close attention to their\ntraining and use what you learn next year!
C'mon now, you can't just intrude\non our practice like this.
Aren't you from Toho Academy?\n<avatar_name>, right?

You did pretty well in our match,\nfor a first-year. That stood out to me.
Aren't you from Nankatsu? <avatar_name>, right?
Hey... You're <avatar_name> from Nankatsu!
How could I forget you after you\ngot us so good in our match?
Who were you again? Umm... <avatar_name>, I think?
I think I've seen you play before... not sure\nwhen. But I remember you playing pretty well.
Anyway, since you came all this way to interrupt\nour training, I'm guessing you wanted something?
I want to challenge you, Sawaki.
I want to train with you, Sawaki.
Ooh, a challenge, huh? Sounds like fun.
Fine, I accept.
Sawaki...?
I know, I know, we're in the middle\nof team practice.
I can't do it today,\nbut come back some other time.
Well, I'm glad you're interested,\nbut you sure picked the worst time to ask.
Sorry <avatar_name>, but Meiwa Higashi's in the\nmiddle of team practice. If you want to talk\nto Sawaki, you'll have to come back later.
And there you have it, straight from\nthe captain's mouth. Today's no good.
Anyway, drop by again some time!
Okay, we're done scouting our next opponents.
Did you manage to get a recording\nof them this time?
Yeah, it went perfect-ish. Probably.
So are we good or not...?
Hey, <avatar_name>. Did you see that last match?
Doing some recon?
I was on a run.
Yeah. The team in that match just now\nare going to be our next opponents.
Good to keep at it.
We were doing reconnaissance. The team in that\nmatch just now is who we're up against next.
Actually, we've done this before, too,\nbut the captain screwed up with the camera,\nso we couldn't get a recording.
I said I was sorry!
Yeah, it's cool. Today's match looked like it'll\nbe much more useful than the last one anyway.
But man, it's so hot today. I need a drink.
That's for sure.\nHow about we go buy something nearby?
Good idea. Come with us, <avatar_name>.
Why waste this chance? We can talk\nabout soccer while we get refreshed!
Finally. I've been waiting for you, <avatar_name>.
Luckily, I've got time today.\nTraining, challenge, whatever, let's do it!
Phew... I'm beat.
Okay, let's wrap this up with a one-on-one!\nGo go go!
Take this!
Have a taste of the Meiwa Higashi Sliding Squad!
You can't catch me!
I'm a forward on one of the top four teams\nfrom Nationals! It won't be that easy!
Wow, I may have won that last one,\nbut it could've gone either way.
It's hard to believe you're a first-year.
Plus, you're on the same team as Takeshi.\nToho Academy's going to be unstoppable next year.
Your school's team must feel comfy\nknowing you'll be in charge next year.
So anyway, you aiming to get picked as a rep?
Of course!
I'm focusing on the league for now.
As good as you are,\nI'd be shocked if you weren't picked.
Putting the team first, eh?
Still, doing well in your matches just puts\nyou that much closer to getting chosen.
I'm aiming for it, but I was\nthinking it might be a little tricky.
Still, even if we're not picked this year,\nthere's always high school, and then later\nas a pro. We've got a long road ahead of us.
So let's keep doing our\nbest to polish our skills!
Could you pass that on to Hyuga, Takeshi,\nWakashimazu, and the rest? No matter what,\nthey're still my old teammates from Meiwa FC.
We're all old war buddies who had\npassed through the boot camp of Coach Kira.
I'll be keeping an eye on you guys.
Could you pass that on to your captain, too?
If we ever get matched up in high school,\nmy team's gonna win!
Alright, later! Good luck!
No no no, that's way too shallow! You first\nand second-years don't know how to tackle!
How can we call ourselves the Meiwa Higashi\nSliding Squad with weak moves like that!
Listen up! Keep up the speed and\nkeep charging the ball, no matter what!
There's always a risk when it's right in the\nother guy's legs, but if you don't take that risk\nyou'll NEVER steal the ball!
Don't worry about hitting their feet by accident.\nGo fast, go hard, and get that ball!
This stuff is important you guys! Never forget it!
It's called a squad because it's a squad! We need\neveryone to be on the same page!
One last thing, keep the strategy straight in\nyour head. The name of the game is offense!
We aren't some wussy defensive team. We tackle\nsharp so we can score! Never forget that!
Tak!
Okay guys, remember this strategy!\nNext year we're dominating at Nationals!
Tak!
Meiwa Higashi's Sliding Squad is as\nbrutal as ever. What a playstyle.
If you're going to take over next year,\nthey'll be a team to watch out for.
So pay close attention to their training.\nMaybe it'll help when you have to fight them.
Looks like they're making their playstyle\ninto a school tradition.
Which means they'll be a formidable opponent\nat the tournament next year.\nThey may be your biggest obstacle.
Study them while you have the chance.\nIt can't hurt to have a good bead on them.
(I guess you've really absorbed\nCoach Kira's teachings, huh Sawaki.)
<avatar_name>, that playstyle they use\nstarted with me, at Meiwa FC.
I'll have to teach you that later.\nAnything that even has a chance of helping\nToho Academy is worth pursuing!
Anything that even has a chance of helping\nToho Academy is worth pursuing!
Meiwa Higashi's Sliding Squad, huh?\nSure takes me back to when we played Meiwa FC.
Those ruthless tackles coming at you one after the\nother... Being on the offensive against that is a\nnightmare.
<avatar_name>, if Meiwa Higashi pass down that\ntechnique, you might have to face it next year.
True. It might be a good idea to come up with\na plan to counteract it.
Why not try taking a page out of their book\nand making our own Sliding Squad? Could be fun.
Well, either way, pay close attention to their\ntraining and make it work for you next year!
C'mon now, you can't just intrude\non our practice like this.
Aren't you from Toho Academy?\n<avatar_name>, right?
Wait, you're <avatar_name>! From Toho Academy!
How could I forget you after you\ngot us so good in our match?
I think you were... <avatar_name>, right?
Yeah, I knew it.
I remember hearing that Toho Academy added another\nfirst-year to their line-up, so I checked you out.
You're... <avatar_name>, right?
You did pretty well in our match,\nfor a first-year. That stood out to me.
Aren't you from Otomo? <avatar_name>, right?
Hey, you're... <avatar_name> from Otomo!
How could I forget you after you\ngot us so good in our match?
Who were you again? Umm... <avatar_name>, was it?
I think I've seen you play before... not sure\nwhen. But I remember you playing pretty well.
Anyway, since you came all this way to interrupt\nour training, I'm guessing you wanted something?
I want to challenge you, Sawaki.
I want to train with you, Sawaki.
Ooh, a challenge, huh? Sounds like fun.
Fine, I accept.
What are you doing, Sawaki?
I know, I know, we're in the middle\nof group practice.
I can't do it today,\nbut come back some other time.
Well, I'm glad you're interested,\nbut you sure picked the worst time to ask.
Sorry <avatar_name>, but Meiwa Higashi's in the\nmiddle of team practice. If you want to talk\nto Sawaki, you'll have to come back later.

Anything that even has a chance of helping\nToho Academy is worth pursuing!
Meiwa Higashi's Sliding Squad\nreally packs a wallop.
I saw them up close in the match between Nankatsu\nSC and Meiwa FC, but they've really powered up\nsince.
For real. The way that tackle\nplowed through was downright scary.
If they take over next year,\nit's gonna be a tough team for Otomo.
Pay close attention to their training, <avatar_name>.\nIt should help for when you have to face them.







Haaah!
Tak!
That's it!
You're mine!
Get a load of this!
Push in!
Idziemy!























Captain!
Up to you now!
Get it done!
Heading your way!
Here goes nothin'!
Take it to 'em!
Keep up!
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!
Kazuo!
Nitta!
Jito!
Soda!
Ishizaki!
Wakashimazu!

Blake!
Azwan!
I'm confident in my technique!
I did it!
Alright!
Soccer is a technical game!
Bam! Score!
Whew! You see that?!
How d'you like that?!
Now, let's take the lead and win!
Let's keep on keeping on!
I'm not here to lose!
It's still tied up!
Don't let it get to your head!
We're still in this thing!
Nice one!
Awesome!
Woohoo!
Oh boy...
Bwuh?!
I stop!
Nice pass!
Okay!
Leave it to me!
Go! Go!
Give it to me!
Over here!
Pass the ball!
Pass already!
I'll show you how a gamemaker plays!
We'll hit like a swift wind!
We're all in from the start!
Zróbmy to!
I'm not gonna lose here!
If you could just let me pass!
My technique's better, Tsubasa!
Tsubasa Ozora, that was crazy!
You don't live up to your reputation!
So this is the Fierce Tiger!
You don't live up to the rumors, Misaki!
Is this technique from France?!
I won't lose to you anymore, Matsuyama!
Dammit... Against Matsuyama of all!
Natural talent? More like no talent!
I lost a battle in technique?!
Try and keep up, Masao!
Ugh, Masao... I let my guard down!
You're no match for me, Kazuo!
Kazuo... I should've been on my toes!
Speed's not enough to beat me!
That speed was out of this world!
Soccer is more technique than power!
Jito... What horrifying strength!
My technique wins out, Soda!
So this is what the Ace Killer can do.
You're no match for me, Ishizaki!
Me? Lose to Ishizaki? How?!
Luck's on my side as well.
Afraid to take me one-on-one?
Yo, <avatar_name>. Remember me?\nI'm Ishida, captain of Minamiuwa MS.
Well, I'm not gonna go down as the guy who\nlost to a first-year at Furano of all places.\nI'm here to prove a point!
So you're <avatar_name>?\nI'm Ishida, captain of Minamiuwa MS.
I've kept an eye out for you since I heard Furano\nput a first-year in their starting line-up.\nLooks like you got a little skill.
So anyway... I've come for a challenge!
Yo, <avatar_name>. Remember me?\nI'm Ishida, captain of Minamiuwa MS.
I'm here to return a beat down to sender.\nI'm here to challenge you!
So you're <avatar_name>?\nI'm Ishida, captain of Minamiuwa MS.
I've been curious about you since\nI heard you made regular as a first-year.\nYou're not half bad, y'know.
But now it's time to see how you really\nmeasure up. Show me what you've got!
You'll square off with me, Ishida?
Alright, then! Bring it on!
Who do you think you are, punk?!
At least, this should be worth my while!
You're not the only one who takes pride\nin his technique! Time for a showdown!
And you're about to get outdrawn!
Here I come, <avatar_name>!
Wh-What?!
Wh-What?!
You've gotta be kidding me!\nI lost to a first-year?!
And from Furano?!
(This guy's not your average kid!)
...
Thanks for accepting my challenge.
Guess I've still a lot to learn.\nNothing to do but keep practicing.
But you can bet I'll be back again!\nAnd I'll get you next time!
Later!
Sorry I'm late, <avatar_name>! Let's go buy\nsome cleats at that store we went to before!
Huh? What's wrong?
C'mon! And now we're back at the stadium?
I mean, I'm just following the map on my phone.\nIt's not my fault all these buildings look the\nsame.
Hey, aren't you...
Oh, it's Ishida and Takei. What's up you two?
Actually, we were thinking about heading to\na sporting goods store for some new cleats.\nBut we're kinda lost.
We were following our GPS, but I don't get\nthis place at all. It'd be easier to find things\nwithout all these buildings in the way.
Well, why don't you come with us?
We went to a store nearby with the team before,\nso we could show you the way.
Wow, that'd be great!
Thanks, Oda. You got us out of a jam back there.
Yeah, man. We managed to get shiny new shoes.
No prob. I know you'd do the same for us.
But what now? It's too early to head back,\nbut there's not enough time to do much else.
Should we test drive these cleats?
I'm thirsty.
Right away?\nJeez, is there anything in your head but soccer?
But it's not a bad idea.
Okay, then let's head over to the\npractice field. We can train together!
This may be practice, Oda, but I\nhaven't forgotten about Nationals!
Bring it on!
Hmmm... Is there anywhere around\nhere we could buy something to drink?
Well, wanna talk soccer?
Could you tell me more about Furano?\nI've been curious about you ever since you beat\nus at Nationals.
And who knows, it might come in handy\nwhen we're playing in high school.
Sure thing. But you've gotta tell\nus about Minamiuwa, too. Deal?
Deal! Now, let's go find a convenience store.
Sorry for the wait, <avatar_name>.\nNow, let's go buy us some new cleats!
Huh? What's wrong?
C'mon! And now we're back at the stadium?
I mean, I'm just following the map on my phone.\nIt's not my fault all these buildings look the\nsame.
<avatar_name>...
Oh, it's Ishida and Takei. What's up you two?
If I remember right...\nYou're Ishida and Takei, from Minamiuwa.\nI saw your match with Furano at Nationals.
Something up? You seem bothered.
Actually, we were thinking about heading to\na sporting goods store for some new cleats.\nBut we're kinda lost.
We were following a GPS, but I don't get this\nplace at all. I can't see where anything is\nwith all these buildings in the way.
Ah, that's why.
Actually, we were right about to go buy\nsome cleats ourselves. Wanna come with us?
Wow, that'd be great!
For real? Then what are we waiting for?
Thanks, Ichinose.\nYou really got us out of a jam back there.
Yeah, man. We managed to get\nour new shoes thanks to you.
We've all got to help each other out, right?
But what now? It's too early to head back,\nbut there's not enough time to do much else.
Should we test drive these cleats?
I'm thirsty.
There's not much time, but you still want to kick\nthe ball around? Can't say you're not dedicated.
And it's not a bad idea.
Okay, then let's head over to the\npractice field. We can train together!
Sure!
Me, too. Is there anywhere around\nhere we could buy something to drink?
So, wanna talk soccer?
I wanna hear all about your captain, Misugi.
I'm no slouch, but I could\nstill learn a lot from him.
I don't mind sharing, but I'm not sure how\nmuch it'll help. Misugi's a little... special.
Well, don't just leave us hanging, tell us about\nhim! And say something if you see a convenience\nstore.
Sorry for the wait, <avatar_name>.\nNow, let's go buy us some new cleats!
Huh? What's the matter?
C'mon! And now we're back at the stadium?
I mean, I'm just following the map on my phone.\nIt's not my fault all these buildings look the\nsame.
<avatar_name>...
Ishida and Takei? What's wrong you two?
Wait, is that Takeshi Sawada?
Oh, you know me?
Who doesn't know the Toho Academy first-year that\nbecame a shot caller? I'm a technician myself,\nso you've caught my interest already.
Oops, forgot to introduce myself.\nI'm Tetsuo Ishida from Minamiuwa,\nand this is my teammate, Takei.
Nice to meet you.
So what's goin' on?\nYou were looking a little troubled.
Actually, we were thinking about heading\nto a sports store for some new cleats.\nBut we're kinda lost.
We were following a map, but I don't get this\nplace at all. There aren't this many buildings\nwhere we're from.
Oh? Then how about we go together. Actually,\nwe were right about to go buy cleats ourselves.
That'd be great!
Thanks, you two. You really helped us out.
Yeah, man. We managed to get\nshiny new shoes thanks to you.
I'm sure you'd do the same for us.
But now we've got a different problem.\nIt's too early to head back to the dorms,\nbut too late to get started on much else.
Should we test drive these cleats?
Is anyone else thirsty?
That's our <avatar_name>...\nAlways thinking about soccer.
But it's not a bad idea.
Okay, then let's head over to the\npractice field. We can train together!
Sure!
Yeah. Is there anywhere we\ncan buy something to drink?
So, wanna talk soccer?
I'm curious about how the great Toho Academy\npractices. I'd love to hear all about it.
I want to pass it on to the younger kids at\nMinamiuwa. Plus, it couldn't hurt for high\nschool, too.
I mean, we're still just first-years so\nthere's not much we can tell you, but sure.
Okay, then that's that! Let's go find a\nconvenience store! Drinks are on me you two!
Awesome! Thanks!
Yo, <avatar_name>. I've watched your matches.\nIt's pretty amazing how you got this far without\nlosing.
Of course, we won. I'm here.
It's all thanks to my teammates.
Haha, confident, aren't we?
Makes sense though, after seeing\nsome of the stuff you've pulled off.
You're pretty humble, huh?
Sure, you've got some great teammates,\nbut you hold your own.
With that in mind, remember when I said\nI'd be back to challenge you again?
Well, you've gotten a lot better since then,\nbut I've been training my butt off, too!\nAnd I don't think I'll lose!
So now's the time! Zróbmy to!
Here I come, <avatar_name>!
I did it... I did it!
I did it... I did it!
All that training, day after day, just for this!
...
Thanks for accepting my challenge again.
I'm aiming to get chosen as a rep, but with\nmidfielders like Matsuyama, Tsubasa, Misugi, and\nSawada here, I know it'll be tough to stand out.
But it doesn't end here. Obviously I'm gonna\nkeep playing soccer in high school,\nand after that I'm planning to go pro.
Which is why I wanted to beat you,\nno matter how hard I had to work.
I needed to prove to myself that I could get\nbetter and measure up to an opponent who beat\nme before.
Seriously, thank you <avatar_name>.\nNow, I can believe in myself again.
So good luck in your remaining matches!\nWith your skill I just KNOW you'll get picked.\nI'm rooting for you!
Come on you first and second-years! With\ndribbling and passes like that, forget Nationals;\nwe'll be struggling to be the best in Shikoku!
Soccer is all about technique! As long as we\nhave the technique, then we control both the ball\nAND the match!
Absolutely!
He's right! Tough guys are nothing if you have\nthe technique to dribble circles around 'em!
So listen up, guys! We're going to polish up our\nmoves and teamwork. We need to fight as a team!
Next year, I want to see you win at Nationals!
Tak!
Fighting as a team, huh?
Sounds like Ishida learned\nsomething from our match.
Pay close attention to their training,\n<avatar_name>.
Because when you're up against Minamiuwa MS at\nNationals next year, they'll be a whole new team.
Soccer is all about technique...? I agree.
Power and muscle are useless\nwithout the technique to use them.
And the entire team being able to coordinate\nwell is one of the ideals of soccer.\nYou should commit that to memory, yourself.
Soccer is all about technique...?\nWell, I guess that's the most reliable way\nto improve as a team.
I mean, most people aren't Hyuga,\nthat's just a fact.
(And without Hyuga next year...\nI'll need to make my own adjustments.)
Pay close attention to their training,\n<avatar_name>.
It'll definitely come in handy\nwhen we have to face them next year.

I mean, he's not wrong.
It's true for dribbling through solo, but also,\nour synced-up pass work wouldn't be as effective\nif the passes themselves sucked.
And if everyone on the team can do it,\nthe team's overall strength goes way up.
<avatar_name>, it might end up being you leading\nHanawa MS next year.
I dunno what kind of team you wanna form,\nbut remember one option is a playstyle where\nyou sharpen basic techniques to the max!
Sorry to drag you along to go shopping with us,\n<avatar_name>.
Well, let's go check out some cleats at the soccer\nstore!
Huh? What's wrong?
C'mon! We're back at the stadium?
I mean, I'm just following the map on my phone.\nIt's not my fault all these buildings look the\nsame.
<avatar_name>...
Hey, it's Ishida and Takei! What's up you two?
Oh, it's you guys, uh...\nIshida and Takei from Minamiuwa, right?
Something wrong? You look kinda flustered.
Actually, we were thinking about heading to\na sporting goods store for some new cleats.\nBut we're kinda lost.
We were following a GPS, but I don't get this\nplace at all. I can't see where anything is\nwith all these buildings in the way.
Ah, that's why.
Well, guess what! We were just headed to the store\nourselves.
You guys wanna tag along?
We're from outta town, too, so we don't really\nknow the area, but if we all look for it together\nwe'll figure it out!
Sure! Don't mind if we do!
Thank you guys. You really helped us out today.
Definitely! We managed to get\nour new shoes thanks to you!
Don't worry about it!
As they say, a friend in need...!
Looks like we got some time left over,\nbut not really enough to do anything.
Yeah. It's too early to head back to the dorms.
Should we test drive these cleats?
I'm thirsty.
We've barely any time and you still wanna play?
That's so like you, <avatar_name>!
But it's not a bad idea.
Okay, then let's head over to the\npractice field. We can train together!
Let's!
Same. Walking around in the heat and all.
Then let's go get something to drink somewhere.
While we're at it, wanna talk soccer?
I wanna hear all about the way you guys practice\nand your playstyle.
Especially about how you guys play in the air!
We don't really mind talking about it, but...
Our aerial brand of soccer isn't something anyone\ncan do simply if they give it a whirl.
Oh, for sure. I doubt I could even try to imitate\nwhat you guys do.
I'm honestly just curious.\nHow did you guys even come up with that stuff?!
Tak! I'd love to be able to pull off stunts\nlike those!
Alright!
Let's hit up the convenience store then!





Soccer is all about technique...?\nI don't disagree.
It's like Takei said, the better your technique,\nthe better you can utilize power.
Sano, <avatar_name>, use this chance to learn all\nsorts of play styles and put them to work for you\nnext year.
The more strategic options ya give yourself,\nthe more advantages you'll have!
You got it!
Let's get Minamiuwa's style down pat!
Ah, my bad. Some of my friends from school\ncontacted me and it took a minute to get back to\nthem.
Well, let's go check out some cleats at the soccer\nstore, like we planned!
Huh? Did you see someone?
C'mon! We're back at the stadium?
I mean, I'm just following the map on my phone.\nIt's not my fault all these buildings look the\nsame.
<avatar_name>...
Well, if it isn't Ishida and company...\nWhat's eating you?
Wait, don't tell me...\nIshida and Takei from Minamiuwa, right?
So, what's goin' on? Something the matter?
Actually, we were thinking about heading to\na sporting goods store for some new cleats.\nBut we're kinda lost.
We were following a GPS, but I don't get this\nplace at all. I can't see where anything is\nwith all these buildings in the way.
Well, that works out. We were just headed to\na soccer store ourselves.
I'm not super familiar with this area either,\nbut I know my way around a map.\nWanna go there together?
Sure! Don't mind if we do!
Thanks, Sano, <avatar_name>.\nYou guys are lifesavers.
Yeah, man. We managed to get our new shoes\nthanks to you!
Don't mention it!\nI'm sure you'd do the same for us.
So, what should we do now? It's kinda early to\nhead back to the dorms.
Should we test drive these cleats?
Sano, I'm parched!
I had a feeling you'd say that, <avatar_name>.\nYou're such a soccer fiend.
But it's not a bad idea.
Okay, then let's head over to the practice field.\nWe can train together!
Alright, let's do it!
Are you trying to tell me that I need to treat you\nto a drink? Oh, why not?
Okay, then let's go to that convenience store back\nthere! Drinks are on me, you two!
Oh? Are you sure?
You helped us out today.\nConsider it thanks for that.
I wanna talk soccer for a bit, too.
You guys at Hirado are some of the toughest in the\ncountry. I'd love to hear about the kind of\ntraining you guys do and that sort of thing.
Being strong's kind of my calling card, so I wanna\nhear what you have to say about Jito. See what I\ncan do to prep for playing in high school.
Sure thing! Talking about Hirado's play style and\ntalking about Jito are practically the same thing.
Granted, we've got a couple of crazy stories to\ntell but don't let those scare you off.
Ooh... I think I know what you mean.
It wouldn't surprise me if you told me\nhe used to get in fights every day.\nHe has that air about him.
(It's that obvious, huh?)
Let's hit up the convenience store then!
Come on you first and second-years! With\ndribbling and passes like that, forget Nationals;\nwe'll be struggling to be the best in Shikoku!
Soccer is all about technique! As long as we\nhave the technique, then we control both the ball\nAND the match!
Absolutely!
He's right! Tough guys are nothing if you have\nthe technique to dribble circles around 'em!
So listen up, guys! We're going to polish up our\nmoves and teamwork. We need to fight as a team!
Next year, I want to see you win at Nationals!
Tak!
Soccer is all about technique, huh?
If you ask me, having the nerve to never give up\nis the most important thing in soccer,\nbut I won't deny having technique helps.
If everyone in the team plays well, there's no\ndoubt the overall strength of the team will go up.
Tsubasa outshines all of us, but Nankatsu's\nstrength also lies in skilled players like Izawa,\nKisugi, and Taki.
I worked hard, too, but I'm the type that needs a\nbit more time and effort than others to improve.
Um, I guess what I'm trying to say is this.
<avatar_name>, if you're gonna be leading the team\nnext year, I think it's a good idea for everyone\nto push their technique further.
Sorry, <avatar_name>. You must be tired from\npractice, but you still came shopping with me.
Well, let's go check out some goalkeeper gloves\nat the soccer goods store!
Something wrong?
C'mon! We're back at the stadium?
Weird. I'm just following the map on my phone.\nIt's not my fault all these buildings look the\nsame.
<avatar_name>...
Hey, it's Ishida and Takei. What's up you two?
Wait, don't tell me...\nIshida and Takei from Minamiuwa, right?
Something up? You seem troubled.
See, we were thinking about heading to a\nsporting goods store for some new cleats.\nBut we're kinda lost.
We were following a map, but I don't get this\nplace at all. I can't see where anything is\nwith all these buildings in the way.
Oh, is that all?
Actually, we were right about to go check out\nthe store ourselves. Wanna come with us?
For real? Then, what are we waiting for?
Thanks, Morisaki, <avatar_name>.\nYou guys are lifesavers.
Yeah, man.\nWe managed to get our new shoes thanks to you!
Don't worry about it.\nThe golden rule and everything, right?
It'd be a waste to head straight back\nto the dorms, though. What should we do?
Wanna try those cleats and gloves?
I could use a drink.
Even in your spare time, the only thing\non your mind is soccer, isn't it?\nCan't say you're not dedicated.
But you know, it's not a bad idea.
Okay, then let's head over to the practice field.\nWe can train together!
Sounds like a plan!
You know what? Me too.\nWanna get something to drink somewhere?
While we're at it, wanna talk soccer?
I wanna hear all about the way you guys practice\nand your playstyle.
You'll be competing at the high school level soon,\nand Nankatsu had a threepeat at Nationals.\nYou've gotta have some pointers.
Sure, why not.
Just so you know, though, I wasn't born with\ntalent like some of my teammates.\nI had to work at it every day.
In that sense, I know everything there is\nabout how Nankatsu practices.
Tell us as much as you can.\nBut first, let's find us a convenience store!
Come on you first and second-years! With\ndribbling and passes like that, forget Nationals;\nwe'll be struggling to be the best in Shikoku!
Soccer is all about technique! As long as we\nhave the technique, then we control both the ball\nAND the match!
Tak!
He's right! Tough guys are nothing if you have\nthe technique to dribble circles around 'em!
So listen up, guys! We're going to polish up our\nmoves and teamwork. We need to fight as a team!
Next year, I want to see you win at Nationals!
Tak!
Fighting as a team, huh?
Sounds like Ishida learned\nsomething from our match.
Pay close attention to their training,\n<avatar_name>.
Because when you're up against Minamiuwa MS at\nNationals next year, they'll be a whole new team.
Soccer is all about technique...? I agree.
Power and muscle are useless\nwithout the technique to use them.
And the entire team being able to coordinate\nwell is one of the ideals of soccer.\nYou should commit that to memory, yourself.
Soccer is all about technique...?\nWell, I guess that's the most reliable way\nto improve as a team.
I mean, most people aren't Hyuga,\nthat's just a fact.
(And without Hyuga next year...\nI'll need to make my own adjustments.)
Pay close attention to their training,\n<avatar_name>.
It'll definitely come in handy\nwhen we have to face them next year.
Soccer is all about technique, huh?
Well, I don't think that's all there is to it.\nGranted, it is better to have it than not to.
If you can break through the opponent in front of\nyou with a dribble, you can take the initiative to\nattack.
And from there, when you're passing, you need\nprecise control to be able to put the ball where\nthe forwards need it.
If the whole team can do that, team strength\nskyrockets, so keep polishing your technique.
Sorry for the wait, <avatar_name>.\nNow, let's go buy us some new cleats!
Huh? What's wrong?
C'mon! We're back at the stadium?
I mean, I'm just following the map on my phone.\nIt's not my fault all these buildings look the\nsame.
<avatar_name>...
Oh, it's Ishida and Takei. What's up you two?
If I remember right... You're Ishida and Takei,\nfrom Minamiuwa. I saw your match with Furano at\nNationals in the stadium.
Something up? You seem bothered.
Actually, we were thinking about heading to\na sporting goods store for some new cleats.\nBut we're kinda lost.
We were following a GPS, but I don't get this\nplace at all. I can't see where anything is\nwith all these buildings in the way.
Ah, that's why.
Actually, we were right about to go buy\nsome cleats ourselves. Wanna come with us?
For real? Then, what are we waiting for?
Thank you guys.\nYou really got us out of a jam back there.
Yeah, man. We managed to get\nour new shoes thanks to you!
No prob! I know you'd do the same for us.
It's too early to head straight back to the dorms,\nthough. What should we do?
Should we test drive　these cleats?
I'm thirsty.
There's not much time, but you still want to kick\nthe ball around? Can't say you're not dedicated.
But it's not a bad idea.
Okay, then let's head over to the\npractice field. We can train together!
Idziemy!
Now that you mention it, I'm pretty thirsty, too.\nWanna get something to drink somewhere?
While we're at it, wanna talk soccer?
I wanna hear all about the way you guys play.
Would love to learn about that defensive\ncombo of yours... for future reference.
Yeah, sure.
That said, don't fool yourselves into thinking you\ncan pull it off just because I pass on the down\nlow!
We spent a whole lotta time\nperfecting the style for our combo.
Well, don't just leave us hanging, tell us about\nit! And say something if you see a convenience\nstore.







Haaah!
Łoł!
There we go!
Gotcha!
Ha!
Go!
Get in there!

Papa, Mama, did you see me?
Best striker in the world? That's me!
I will not lose... to anyone!
I am the best in all the world!
This... This is my might.
Hmph. I'm not done yet!
Hmph. As expected.
Yes! The lead will be ours!
All for the win!
I won't lose!
You'll pay for that!
Don't let up now!
Don't give up! It' not over yet!
Good one!
Nice!
That's it!
Not good!
What?!
Stop them!
Good pass!
Yes!
Leave it to me!
Here I go!
Here!
Over here!
Let me have it!
Pass it!
Time to show our strength!
In soccer, the strong win!
It's a battle of wills, now!
Here I go!
I've got it!
This is it!
Ha!
Fire!
Take this!
Idziemy!
Turn on the heat!
Oh no you don't!
You're done!
Move!
Tsubasa! You can't beat me!
It's not over yet, Tsubasa!
I'm the best in the world, Hyuga!
I'll get you back, Hyuga!
You can't beat me, Misaki!
Gah, dang it! Misaki!
I'm not impressed, Matsuyama!
Tch! You're so stubborn, Matsuyama!
You can't fool me, Misugi!
Misugi! What a move!
Guts alone don't win, Ishizaki!
You've got guts, Ishizaki!
Put your back into it, Kaltz!
Attaboy, Kaltz!
Can't win like that, Schester!
That's the Knight of Bremen I know!
You'll need more than that, Margus!
That's the Margus I know!
Get serious, Heine!
You've gotten stronger, Heine!
Heh, you put up a good fight, Pierre!
Tch! Fooled by fancy footwork!
I won't lose, Napoleon!
Jeez, Napoleon! That was bad...
I'm ready for you, Shield of France!
I won't lose again, Jean!
Do you see my skill, Kluivoort?!
So, this is Kluivoort?
Heh, the rumors were overblown!
No denying the fantasista's strength!
You may be Brazil's ace but I still won!
I see why they call you Brazil's ace!
Who's got better moves, Diaz?
How do you move like that, Diaz?
I won't lose to you, Victorino!
You're a joke, Victorino!
My technique surpasses yours, Senghor.
Senghor! This is just... Wow!
I go beyond the data, Ryan!
How did you know what I would do, Ryan?
Brute force isn't good soccer!
Oi, Blake, that was something!
Soccer is more than a game of power.
He's up to something. I know it!
The goal is my only aim!
I don't have time to worry about others.
Don't underestimate me!
Junior Youth World Challenge Preliminaries,\nBlock A, Japan vs. Netherlands
Uh oh!
Gotcha, Japan!
Wait, what?
(That shot just now was no less fearsome than my\nFire Shot.)
(And yet he caught it so easily?\nYou've really improved, Wakabayashi.)
Not bad at all, Wakabayashi.
Yeah. It's like he leveled up from last time\nwe saw him.
Eh, I could've scored with that\nshot though!
That's some confidence. Right, Schneider?
...
Uh?
Junior Youth World Challenge,\nAfter the Preliminaries
So today's a practice match with England?
Well, we've got our match with America coming up,\nso don't go getting hurt.
Still, it'd suck to lose, wouldn't it?\nWhat's important is that we dominate the field\nand don't even give 'em a chance to outperform us.
No need to worry.\nBetween me and Schneider, it'll all work out.
Right, Schneider?
Of course.
(Something's off.\nIt's like his heart's not in it.)
(From what I saw in the prelims,\nWakabayashi's defense was flawless.)
(In which case, I'll have to really blast the ball\npast him.)
(My record against Wakabayashi is a perfect 50/50,\nbut winning has always come down to "reaction.")
(So I'll aim straight to the net without even\ngiving him time to react.)
(But if I'm going to face Wakabayashi in this\ntournament, it'll be in the finals.)
(So I have until then to work out a brand-new\nFire Shot!)
Gah... I can't believe Germany's this strong even\nin just a practice match. We don't stand a chance!
Whoops. We meant to conserve our energy,\nbut it's hard to hold back in a match.
Is that how it works?\nI was just going with the flow.
I don't think I could ever match that part of you,\nKaltz.
All right then, let's get outta here.
...
(This time I tried to emphasize control rather\nthan power in my shots, but seems like it went\nwell.)
(And I gained more than just control.\nBy holding back my strength, the kick was lighter\nand faster, too. I didn't miss a single opening.)
(But it's not enough. Wakabayashi would've been\nable to catch those without breaking a sweat.)
(It's still far from the perfected shot I've been\nsearching for.)
Something on your mind, Heine?
Didn't Schneider seem different today, Kaltz?
Yeah. He gets like that.
I can pretty much tell just from his expression.\nHe must be lost in thought over some new play or\nsomething. Nothing to worry about.
Hey, who said I was worried?
(It seemed like he was concentrating on holding\nback his strength, so his Fire Shots would come\nout faster and with more control.)
(But... why? For what?)
Junior Youth World Challenge Finals Tournament,\nAfter the Quarterfinals, German Practice Area
(Hmm... The kick just isn't coming together.\nIt feels like I've hit a dead end.)
...
(Come to think of it, didn't that guy from Japan\npick up the Fire Shot a little while ago?)
(Maybe I should follow his example and look to\nother people's skills for inspiration.)
Let the curtain raise on my glorious dribbling\nperformance!
You won't slip past me, Heine!
Heine!
Watch out for a pass to Schneider!
(Everyone's gathered here... Now's my chance!)
Ha ha ha, perfect!
(Just now, that was!)
Urgh... I couldn't react at all.
Try not to feel too bad, I'm just great at taking\nadvantage of the state of the field.
What do you mean by that?
I mean, all the defenders were clustered around\nme, right? In that situation, there's no way the\ngoalie can get a clear look at me.
In other words, I was shooting from a blind spot.\nStein had no way of knowing the timing on my shot.
Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.
It's pretty situational though, since it depends\non the positioning of both the defenders and the\nkeeper.
Which goes to show how awesome I am for pouncing\non that split-second opportunity!
At least, you don't lack confidence.
(I see...)
(While I've approached defenders before in order\nto shoot from a blind spot...)
(...I never thought about drawing them in to take\nadvantage of the one they'd create.)
(Schneider's looking awfully absorbed in what\nI just said, huh?)
(If he's really thinking about a new play like\nKaltz said, then maybe he just had an epiphany.)
That Afternoon, Before the Germany vs. Senegal\nPractice Match, During the Senegalese Training
So we're up against Senegal today?
Now that you mention it, this is our first match\nagainst an African team.
These guys might be even faster than Brazil,\nwho we're playing next. This could be a good\nchance to get used to that kind of hustle.
Schneider!
Yes?
See that guy with the ball right now? Number 10?\nKeep an eye on him.
(By running over here, the goalie will move to the\nright... Now's my chance!)
Nice one, Senghor!
You have the timing and technique to burn a shot\npast their keeper from that angle.
Think you can make that work, Schneider?
Heine...
All right, let's wrap this up quick and carry our\nmomentum straight to our match with Brazil!
Dang, is this for real? How can Germany be so\nstrong?
But I'm glad we got to face them. We've learned\na lot about what we still need to be able to\nface them on even footing.
True enough. You can learn so much from a loss!
(Still, the Schneider I faced today was different\nfrom the one I saw from the stands. He took us on\nwith technique, not power.)
(I guess to him a match with us is nothing more\nthan a place to fine-tune his playstyle.\nCan't say I love being a guinea pig.)
Wow, Senegal's speed was even crazier than\nI imagined. I'm glad we got to face them.
And if Brazil adds South American technique on top\nof that... that's going to be rough.
(After seeing Schneider's goals today,\nI'm sure of it.)
(Schneider's trying to learn a technique that\nwon't give the goalie a chance to react.)
(And the only person could push Schneider to go\nthat far is...)
(...Wakabayashi.)
(Heine was right.\nPaying attention to Senghor was the right idea.)
(While the properties of his shots are completely\ndifferent, the way he moves his body and kicks to\nthrow off the goalie could be very useful.)
(By reading the situation like Heine, and making\nuse of my movements like Senghor, I'll create my\nown split-second opening.)
(And with the speed of my Fire Shot on top of all\nthat...)
(...They won't even have a chance to react,\neven if I reduce the power of the shot a little.)
(However...)
(I still feel like something's missing.\nLike that's not enough to really score on\nWakabayashi...)
Junior Youth World Challenge Semifinals,\nGermany vs. Brazil
Here we go, Brazil!
What?! Margus let the ball through!
Schneider has slipped away from his mark and is\ncharging toward the ball!
It's all on you now, Captain!
(Kaltz... Muller... Schester... Heine... and\nMargus. This ball means everything to all of us.)
I won't miss!
(That was it! It finally came together!\nI could feel that surpassing the Fire Shot!)
Junior Youth World Challenge Finals Tournament,\nAfter the Semifinals, German Practice Area
(I've been aiming to power up the Fire Shot since\nbefore the tournament, and in that last match with\nBrazil I finally did it. The High Fire Shot.)
(With this, I can score through sheer power,\neven against Wakabayashi, from outside the box!)
(No... Since I got here, the "perfection"\nI've been after is something different.\nA goal that not even Wakabayashi can react to.)
(He's been improving over the tournament, too.\nNo doubt he can react to the High Fire Shot.\nAnd if he can react, he has a chance to stop it.)
(But I'm almost out of time before the finals with\nJapan. I need to hurry.)
(Luckily, we joined up with a goalie just as good\nas Wakabayashi... Muller.)
(So my goal for today is to score that "perfect"\ngoal on Muller first!)
Don't underestimate the German defense!\nWe're the best of the best, too!
You're not getting that shot off, Schneider!
...
(I'm in Muller's blind spot. And he is...)
Now!
What?!
Come on, Schneider, did you really expect a\nhalf-baked shot like that to work on ME?
Darn it...
(Schneider...)
(Muller shouldn't have been able to see me from\nthere, not through all the defenders.)
(And the timing, kick speed, and trajectory were\nall perfect. So how did he--?!)
(Was I wrong? Has all the progress I've made\ntoward the "perfect goal" against Wakabayashi\nbeen for nothing?)
Schneider.
Heine?
I could tell you've been working on something ever\nsince the practice match with England.
Something like a shot that leaves no room for the\ngoalkeeper to react?
Yeah...
And you need this because of Wakabayashi, right?
Yes...
I knew it.
Honestly, as a rival it bugs me more than a little\nthat you're so focused on him. Guess I'm jealous.
But, well, also as a rival,\nthere are certain things I notice.
From what I can tell, your awareness of your\nsurroundings, your timing, and your technique\nare all perfect.
But the reason you didn't score is because all\nyou're doing is copying the form.
What do you mean?
You're not putting any spirit into the shot,\nso the power and sharpness just aren't there.\nThat's why it's easy to block.
Duch?
On one hand you've constructed a very technical\ngoal that the keeper can't react to.
But as a player, you're yearning for a clash of\nwills with Wakabayashi, a contest of raw power,\nright?
I...
Compared to you, I'm just a little, a little mind\nyou, lacking in power.
But anyone who thinks I couldn't stand up to\nWakabayashi because of that is dead wrong.
I have the world's most gorgeous technique.\nAnd through matches in Dresden and Hamburg,\nI've pitted my strengths against Wakabayashi.
A battle between devoted players isn't just a\nmatter of two trains colliding head on.
What matters is that both of you are giving it\neverything you've got. That's what counts.
So you have to cleanly decide your feelings here.\nIf you want power, then go power, and if you want\ntechnique, then go technique.
No matter which side you choose to sacrifice, you\nneed the resolve and commitment to see your choice\nthrough. That's what I think anyway.
...
...
You're right, Heine... I've been approaching this\nnew style without my usual inner drive.
After finally mastering the High Fire Shot, I'd\nbeen struggling with for so long, I ended up\nwanting to use it in the showdown, no matter what.
And it's only natural that shot with no resolve\nbehind it wouldn't get past Muller.
...
Okay. From this moment on, I'll forget about\neverything from before or outside this tournament,\nincluding past successes.
I will definitely master this style,\nall for a shot at a new showdown with Wakabayashi!
Yeah, that's the right attitude!
Good timing, too. We've got a practice match\ncoming up, and we're up against Muller.\nShow him your new resolve!
No way... You actually got one past me!
You did it, Schneider! If it works on Muller, then\nyour "perfect goal" should work on Wakabayashi!
Yeah. That match made me sure of it.
So your new playstyle was made with Wakabayashi\nin mind after all?
Kaltz.
But Heine, aren't you concerned about Schneider\nlearning this new style?
I mean, the gap between you two is only growing.
It's fine. The better my rival becomes the\nbrighter my star will shine.
And even if my rival gets the jump on me, the\nstory of this star is one where I shoot past him\nin the end!
Yes, indeed... How about I master a power shot to\nrival the Fire Shot next?
Interesting take. As his rival, what do you think,\nSchneider?
I don't mind. If you think you can keep up with my\ntraining regimen, that is.
Eh, I've been keeping an eye on you this whole\ntime, and if it's just that...
Ha, that's nothing compared to the training he did\nback at the club. I can only tell you the basics,\nbut...
...And he'd do all that every single day.
To be honest, even though I was training right\nnext to him, I'm not confident I could keep up.
...
I-I see... Then, I'll think about it more after\nmy leg fully heals.
Sounds like a plan.
(It all started with me taking on the new\nchallenge of scoring a perfect goal on\nWakabayashi.)
(And in the end, both the strength and technique\nI've acquired should be enough to do just that.)
(Just you wait, Wakabayashi.\nI'll see you at the finals, and I'll win!)
Alright, next up let's go over some offensive\npatterns.
You better take this seriously, Kaltz!\nAnd you, too Schester.
Fine then. Let's get to it.
Okay Schneider, here we go!
So I'm up against Schneider, Margus, and Heine?\nGuess I won't be phoning it in.
That's why you should be glad you showed up!
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
It's nothing. I saw you arrive, so I came to talk.
But what are you sneaking around in the stands\nfor? I thought you'd walk straight onto the field\nand hunker down on the sideline.
That's how you think of me?
I didn't want to be a nuisance.
Sorry, sorry. You just struck me as a bit...\nindiscreet?
Well, since we're here, maybe we can observe\nthings you wouldn't notice from ground level.
You mean they might act differently knowing you're\naround? You're sharper than I gave you credit for.
But you're right, seeing practice from this\nvantage might give us different insights.
Oh, they're starting.
Here, Schneider!
Here I go!
Alright!
Schneider's tearing through that defense line\nlike he's an axe swinging through a forest.
Okay <avatar_name>, this is where he'll show his\ntrue grit. Try to take in the mood of the field.
I'll block his shot...\nNo, is he going to keep pressing in?
Hey now, don't forget about me!
Margus is there, too! Watch for a pass!
Weak!
Darn it...
He's the same as ever, merciless even to his\nteammates.
So did you catch that, <avatar_name>?\nAfter he got past two defenders,\nKaltz and the rest were confused as to what to do.
That's just how terrifying it is to go up against\nSchneider when he's serious.
If you rush him he might give you the slip, if you\nguard the shot, he might pass to Margus, and if\nyou watch for the pass, he's open to shoot!
His level of play makes every option seem like a\ntrap. I swear he can even grin most players down.\nHe just looks at you and smiles you into fear.
In all my time on the field, I've seldom seen\nplayers who can put on that kind of pressure.
If you want to play like Schneider, pay attention\nto more than what his feet do. You'll need to\nlearn the aura he carries on the field.
The Japan Team Practice
You'll need to do better than that, <avatar_name>!
Us brothers got you beat!
Er... What?
Whoops!
I've got you now, <avatar_name>!
Urgh, what the...?!
Don't flinch, Ishizaki! Go all in!
Who in the what now?
Oh no!
You're open!
(His eyes... He's shooting?!)
Razor Tackle!
What?!
Nice pass, <avatar_name>!
Gah, I was paying too much attention to you,\n<avatar_name>.
You definitely did well out there.
I won't say you're as good as Schneider yet,\nbut you're getting there. Ya got presence.
You stayed one step ahead of the defense, and\nwhen I thought I had you read, you sidestepped\nmy expectations.
You're a hellova player.
(Schneider... This kid is chasing after you\nlike it means his life.)
(I don't know when, but he's gonna be giving you\ntrouble before long!)
Ow ow ow...
What's wrong? You hurt your leg?
Ja. It happened during free kick training,\nwhen I was playing the wall.\nI took one of Schneider's Fire Shots.
Didn't even hit me. It went right past my leg,\nbut the wind friction burned me.
Impressive.
(Going all out against his own teammates\nduring practice? Yeah, that's Schneider.)
Yo <avatar_name>. What is it today?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before...?\nOh yeah, from the scrim! Japan, right?
What're you doin' here?
You're lookin' for Schneider?
I think he's still on the field.\nHold on, I'll go check.
*pant*
Schneider! You've got a visitor!
You're from the Japanese team...
Please, teach me your Fire Shot!
Teach me to kick a fireball!
Huh...?
You came right out with it, eh...
Still, I have my hands full with my own\ntraining. I don't have time for teaching you.
So, I'm sorry, but no. Head on home.
Don't let it get to you.\nHe would've said the same to anyone.
But if you're still interested, why not stop\nby another day? Maybe he'll be in a better mood.
Okay, that wasn't too bad.
It's almost time to wrap it up, Schneider!
Yeah, guess so.
Oh... You're back.
I want to be the best in the world!
I'll keep coming until you teach me!
The world's best, eh?
(Guess he didn't just come on a whim.)
(Could this guy be sincere?)
Fine, I understand.
But let me test you first.
Here's how we'll do this. I'll do ten\nFire Shots from outside the penalty box.\nIf you can stop even one of them, you win.
But if you can't, then throw\nin the towel. Alright?
Hey now, isn't that a little harsh?\nEven Wakabayashi can only block about half.
Here I come!
That's nine shots and nine goals.\nYou've only got one more chance.
(You're not bad for an improv goalie,\n<avatar_name>, but you can't stop that shot.)
(Schneider must know that, too.\nSo why bother with this farce. It would've\nbeen simpler just to turn you down.)
...
Here comes the final shot!
Like I'd back down now!
This is my chance!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Hey, you awake?
You took that Fire Shot right on the\nchin without even flinching. Impressive.
You beat me. As promised,\nI'll teach you the Fire Shot.
But not today. Come back later.
(I see what you're doing, Schneider.)
(You used the first nine shots to make it clear\nthat there's no way he could stop it normally.)
(And then for the tenth, you went for a headshot.)
(Sacrificing a little pain can create\nthe opportunity to stop the ball.)
(But if his resolve had\nbeen even a little shaky...)
(Then the natural response to a shot that powerful\ncoming at your face would be to get out of the\nway. No one would chastise him for it.)
(But he didn't. He intentionally faced it head\non. He proved how much he wanted to learn the\nFire Shot.)
(That reminds me... In our first practice after\nWakabayashi came to Germany, he stopped one of\nSchneider's shots with his noggin', too.)
(So you were seeing if this guy was as serious\nas Wakabayashi? Is that it, Schneider?)
Good for you, <avatar_name>.\nYou get to learn from the best.
Oh, right, and I called Wakabayashi earlier,\nso he should be here soon to pick you up.
Feel free to take it easy while we wait.
You came, <avatar_name>.
The training menu we'll be doing ingesting\nI learned from my father to help power up my\nshots. He's a retired pro.
I've also added my own personal tweaks to it.\nI'll toughen you up.
Your usual regimen?\nJust watching you tires me out.
Alright, let's do this!
I may as well tag along, as well!
Okay, we're about halfway done.\nTime for a little break.
*pant* *pant* That's only half of it...?!
I thought I knew how tough it'd be\nhaving seen it, but this is nuts...
You're making a fuss over just this?\nPathetic, Kaltz.
And how about you, <avatar_name>?\nHow are you holding up?
I have a few second thoughts...
I can handle it! You'll see!
If you don't think you can handle this training\nregimen, then the Fire Shot isn't for you.
Well said. If you want to improve, you\nhave to be able to endure harsh training.
When he first came to Germany, Wakabayashi\nused to stay behind and train after the rest of\nthe team headed out.
Oh yeah. Didn't he used to ask\nyou to train with him?
Of course, that led to a lot of arguments, too.
Okay, break's over. Back to training!\nFirst, we'll take a look at your shooting form.
Okay, we're finished with today's training.
Oh god... I'm... literally... dying here.
What are you made of, <avatar_name>...?
(He's right. I'm impressed that you could keep\nup with training even Kaltz struggles with.)
(But that's not all. Your play during that\nmatch and your concentration during training\nare noteworthy, too.)
(If what my gut's telling me is right,\nthen you could be...!)
That's as far as I can take you, <avatar_name>.\nAll that's left is for you to keep to your\ntraining every day.
Good luck. I know you can do it.
Th-This guy is good!
...!
(I knew it. <avatar_name> is no ordinary player.)
How about that? Perfect, right?
I finally did it!
You're really something...
Ja. Proper training will never let you down.
But just being able to take the shot is\nmeaningless. It's not a genuine Fire Shot until\nyou can score with it in a real game.
I believe Japan's already\nmade it past the prelims?
I'm looking forward to the day I can\nface you in the finals tournament.
If Germany and Japan end up facing off,\nit'll be at the climax of the tournament.
I hope your Fire Shot can\ncarry Japan to the finals.
Unfortunately, Germany's already out.
But you still have a chance\nto win this tournament.
See if you can carry Japan to\nthe finals with that Fire Shot.
So the finals will be fighting\nFire Shot with Fire Shot.
But mine is unparalleled.\nThere's no way I'm losing to you.
Germany will take home the championship.
Okay, we're finished with today's training.
Not bad, <avatar_name>. Looks like\nyou can handle Schneider's training now.
(True... He's made tremendous\ngrowth in such a short time.)
(Wakabayashi, Tsubasa, and now <avatar_name>...)
(With these three leading the way,\nthey've come so far since the scrimmage.\nWe can't underestimate them next time we meet.)
(With this much talent,\nJapan's about to become our biggest threat.)
(We need to step up our game, too, if we\ndon't want to lose this championship.)
(Japan's already a completely different team\nthan they were in the scrims. We can't let\nour guard down for a second!)
<avatar_name>, after training with you\nand everything else, I finally understand.
You're a godlike player.
And... one of my biggest rivals.\nJust like Wakabayashi.
Not just for this tournament. As long as we keep\nplaying soccer, we're going to be butting heads.
And fight for the seat of world's best player.
I'll be the world's best!
Let's both keep getting better!
Heh, of course. It wouldn't be any fun otherwise.
Ja, naturlich.
Naturally, I'll be the world's best.\nI'm not surrendering that to anyone.
You really worry about <avatar_name> a lot,\ndon't you, Schneider?
Is that how it seems?
Well, he's no match for me, but he's definitely\na great player. That much is certain.
And that's why I'll pin him down in the\nfinals and ensure you're the world's best.
Heine...
And then back in the German league, I'll pin you\ndown and take the title of number one myself!
Heh. Sounds good. I'm looking forward to it.
You really worry about <avatar_name> a lot,\ndon't you Schneider?
Is that what you think?
Yeah, I feel the same.
Even though you could be rivals, you end up\nhelping him improve. And what's more,\nyou don't seem to mind.
If anything, part of you seems to like\nhaving a real challenge. You're a strange guy.
Heh. It's good to have strong rivals.
When it comes to standing on top of the world,\nthe higher the better. Don't you agree?
I see. You never disappoint.
But still, the world's a big place, huh?\nWho'd have thought there'd be even more talent\nout there?
Looks like you've got even more\nrivals for world's best, Schneider.
Do you think I'd lose, Kaltz?
Nah. Not you. You'd never lose.
(Karl Heinz Schneider. Someday that name will\nbe carved into soccer history, I'm sure of it.)
<avatar_name>, a striker isn't\njust someone who shoots a lot.
They have to create the team's offensive rhythm\nand make it easier for everyone to dribble in and\nput the ball where it needs to be to score.
Of course, if you're confident in your technique\nit's enough to slip past the opponent and keep\nmoving forward, but...
But sometimes your technique isn't enough, and you\nend up sacrificing speed, rhythm, and ultimately\nlosing offensive momentum.
In times like that, you're better\noff breaking through with force.
You need a powerful sprint, powerful steps,\nand unstoppable momentum.
With these three things, you might seem a bit\noverzealous, but it'll certainly be hard to\nsteal your ball.
The most important thing of all is to\nbelieve that you'll score that goal.\nThat belief will carry you to the end.
With that in mind, I'll teach you\na little trick behind my dribbling.
This dribble is made for strikers.\nSee if you can get a handle on it.
What was that?!
Ha! See that? I won't be bad at footwork forever!
Here we go, Schneider!
Uwaah!
You didn't have to go that hard\nagainst your teammates, Schneider...
Yowch... No, it's fine, Heine.
Margus...
Schneider, you tried to stop me full force\nbecause you thought my dribble was solid, right?
Hmph.
This has been great practice. Thanks, Schneider!
(Margus is such an optimist.)
Schneider's... I mean, that defense was nasty.
Who'd ever think of kicking the ball being\ndribbled up at a guy's stomach? Vicious.
You look like you're pretty interested in how\nthat defensive strat worked, <avatar_name>.
Well, I'm sure you could copy it if you tried\nhard enough, but if you're really serious about\nit, I've got a word of advice.
That was done with the resolve to stop the\nenemy's offense, even if you have to hurt them.
It's not just about stealing the ball. It's about\nthrowing away mercy or pity in order to win.
Whether you can train yourself to be that cruel...\nWell, good luck.
Hyah!
Whoa, that was close!
Nice goal, Schneider!
Oh hey, you're here too <avatar_name>?
Did you see that goal Schneider scored just now?\nYou can tell he senses when he can score.
His Fire Shot grabs all the attention, but\neven without it, he'd be a first rate striker.
He'll use volleys, headers, obvious direct shots,\nand sometimes even quick heel kicks.
And while I've never seen it myself, I wouldn't be\nsurprised if he pulled off a shot with his weaker\nleft leg.
Point is, once he's in the penalty box, he's got\nplenty of options. You need to be ready for him\nto use something other than a Fire Shot.
Speaking as a goalie,\nhe's an unbelievably tricky opponent.
So if you want to be a striker, <avatar_name>,\nbecome someone who can put up a fight at that\nrange.
Long shots are important, too, but if that's all\nyou've got when you're up against me, you'll\nbe up a creek without a paddle.
<avatar_name>? Won't be long before we face off...\nBut didja need something?
You were outstanding against Brazil!
The way Germany played moved my heart!
Ja. That was the real Germany you saw back there.
We just never got a chance to show it before,\nsince all our matches until the quarterfinals\nwere easy peasy. That was the real Germany.
We never surrender in the face of adversity,\nand we push as hard as we can.
That's the heart of the Germany Junior Youth.\nThe German Spirit, if you will.
Actually, I've felt the same thing from you\nduring our training. That fighting spirit that\nechoes when challenged.
I hope you can pass that spirit along to your\nteammates should you ever captain a team.
Nothing is more important\nthan that for seizing victory.
Come to think of it, Wakabayashi once told me\nabout the Japanese Spirit.\nIt sounded like it was pretty similar to ours.
I can't wait to see which will come\nout on top during the finals.
Okay, let's go <avatar_name>!
Ooh! Looking good!
Even Heine would turn pale at the thought of\nkeeping up with Schneider's passes at those\nspeeds.
You were aiming to be the greatest,\nweren't you <avatar_name>?
If so, in the future you'll transfer to a good\nteam and start playing at an even higher level.
I'll be heading to that higher stage first,\nbut I hope you'll catch up before long.
And if we happen to end up on the same team,\nthen we can tackle that goal together.
I have high hopes for you, both as a rival and...\nas a friend.
Only a little time left.\nI guess we've pretty much already won.
Not yet! It's too soon to give up!
Wha...!
Max!
Mileus!
There's no more time!\nYou've gotta make it, Schneider!
Alright. Leave it to me!
Darn it! We were so close!
Great shot, Schneider!
I never doubted you!
You really are amazing!
I couldn't just let the\nopportunity you gave me go to waste.
Hey, so you're watching, too?
But still, Schneider's grown so much over\nthis tournament. He's already a player whose\npersonality shines through in his play.
Strikers stand out a lot, and with\nall the attention comes pressure, too.
The defense worked hard to steal that ball,\nthe rest of the team moved it to the offense,\nand finally, it's all entrusted to one man.
You have to carry all the hopes and struggles\nof your teammates, and if you screw up,\nthose hopes can be crushed.
Schneider's been living up to those expectations\nsince his days in Hamburg, and nowadays he's\neven getting called Germany's "Young Emperor."
Seems like he's formed a mindset that\ntransforms that pressure into a strength.
So if you want to be a first-rate striker,\ntake to heart his example.
Soccer is a sport played by people, not robots.\nThat sort of intangible power is important, too.
<avatar_name>, I thought I'd gotten a good\nhandle on your potential, but it seems I\nstill underestimated you.
With your current skills, you should be able to\ntake the Fire Shot to the next level, just like\nI did.
You've noticed by now, right?\nJust remember that feeling and keep on training.\nI'm sure you can do it.
Well, good luck. Let's meet again someday...\nwhen honor's on the line.
(But I never imagined I'd meet\nsomeone so skilled.)
(No matter how good you get, <avatar_name>,\nthat just gives me a new level to surpass.)
(I always pay my debts. Remember that!)







Haaah!
Gyah!
Now!
Graaah!
Take this!
Go!
Here it goes!























Captain!
It's on you now!
Counting on you!
Go get 'em!
Come on!
Idziemy!
You know what to do!
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!
Kazuo!
Nitta!
Jito!
Soda!
Ishizaki!
Schneider!
Schester!
Margus!
Muller!
Heine!
Pierre!
Napoleon!
Jean!
Kluivoort!
Hernandez!
Rusciano!
Robson!
Carlos!
Keizinho!
Diaz!
Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
I'm going all out!
This is the work of an artisan!
That'll teach you to underestimate me!
How good are my shots? That good.
That... was a Kaltz shot!
This is the German spirit!
Hermann Kaltz is here!
This is just the beginning!
Alright. Time to take the lead!
No way we're losing!
Still just tied!
Don't get careless now!
We can't give up!
Nicely done!
Nice!
There we go!
Not good!
What?!
Shut 'em down!
Good pass!
Yes!
I've got this!
My turn!
Over here!
Me!
Come on, over here!
Pass!
Here comes my shot...
An artisan's shot...
A Kaltz shot...
Might not wanna touch that!
Don't mock me!
You'll regret underestimating me!
Outta the way!
Hermann time! You can't touch this!
Take that!
No more!
This right here.
That'll show ya!
Here I go!
This is the German spirit, Tsubasa!
So, this is the power of Tsubasa Ozora!
Yes! You're done, Hyuga!
Hyuga... What the heck is this guy?
You can't touch me, Misaki!
That's some good technique, Misaki!
That's my power, Matsuyama!
I stuck it out but you got me!
I won't go easy on you, Misugi!
That's some serious skill, Misugi!
I've got it, eh, Schneider?
That's Schneider for ya!
That's a win for me, Schester!
Look at you, Schester!
Not quite there yet, Margus!
How did I lose to Margus?
You won't beat me, Heine!
That's pretty flashy, Heine!
I won't let you have your way, Pierre!
As expected from France's general!
I'm the winner this time, Napoleon!
Now this is unlike me...
This is how an artisan does it, Jean!
That is some good work!
I expected more from you, Kluivoort!
I... you got me, Kluivoort!
That's how I roll, Rusciano!
Rusciano! You, too, are a craftsman!
Heh, this is my skill, Carlos!
Carlos... He's not half bad!
Genius or not, you can't beat me!
Argentina's genius? Now I get it.
In a battle of technique I win, Senghor.
Senghor beat me?!
You can't predict my flow!
Was I so easy to read?!
You can't win with power alone, Blake!
He relies on nothing but strength!
I'm not messing around today!
Time to throw down!
Hmph. Don't get too excited.
I'll show you what a true German is!
Time for a little break, eh?
<avatar_name>, I noticed you've been\nwatching Kaltz's moves lately.\nYou have some refined tastes.
His playstyle isn't flashy, but you can never\ntell what he has up his sleeve. It's scary.
He's especially good when it comes to faking\npeople out. From what I hear, he's top-class among\nthe German team.
That reminds me of when I was on his team back in\nGermany. We played some games that weren't soccer,\nand he really stomped me.
Did you know they play rock, paper, scissors\nin Germany? Kaltz was really good.
The worst though was after I taught him how we\nplay "made you look" after rock, paper, scissors\nin Japan.
What? You want to play "made you look"?\nNot soccer?
Heh... Wakabayashi must have told you.
Alright. Let's play.
What is this made you look game?
Made you look? What's that?
It's a game we play in Japan.
If you lose at rock, paper, scissors, you hafta\nlook up, down, left, or right when the winner says\n"made you look."
At the same time, the winner has to guess\nwhich way the loser will look and point the same\ndirection.
If they go the same way, they win. If they're\nwrong, you do rock, paper, scissors again.
It's all about mind games.\nYou just have to guess which way your opponent\nis going to point and outsmart them.
I think I kinda get it...
It's easier to learn by doing. Want to try?
Sure. I never lose to you in anything, anyway.
Heh... Yeah, right.
Hmm... This looks like the kind of game\nHeine would like.
You're right about that.
Oh, Heine is our midfielder.\nYou must have seen him during the scrimmage.
He's a funny guy.\nTalk to him if you get the chance.
Hey, Kaltz, I want to try this "made you look"\ngame, too!
You're on!
That's weird... I never have this hard of a time\nwinning! Especially against you!
Just accept your loss, Heine.
I haven't lost! I just haven't won yet!
Heh. Now, now... Don't be a sore loser.
You're really good at this.\nI can't believe he hasn't won yet.
There's a trick to it. Against this guy, anyway.
Tell me how you do it!
Me next!
I like your attitude. It's good to be able to\nacknowledge other's abilities.
Let's play a few, and I'll tell you why\nI keep winning.
Sure. Bring it on!
That's eight straight wins for me.\nAnd I think that settles things.
Since I said I would, I'll teach you my trick.
It's simple, really. You just have to make your\nopponent look the way you want by faking them out.
Say I look over to my right.\nDoesn't it look like I'm going to point that way?
How am I supposed to see where your beady eyes\nare looking?!
...!
S-Sorry... Just kidding.
Tch...
I don't know if I have the knack for that.
Yeah... You might be right.
It doesn't have to be your eyes.\nYou can shrug your shoulders or something.\nYou just have to guide your opponent's eyes.
There are various ways...
But that's the best that I can explain it.
Are you wondering why I take this game\nso seriously?
This game is more than it seems.\nThis sort of thing works in soccer, too.
Using casual movements, you can press and confuse\nyour opponents' actions, and with the slightest\neffort you stay ahead of them.
Change where you're looking or the way your feet\nare pointing, or say something distracting. A fake\nkick that looks like a real shot can work, too.
Use techniques like that and mix it up to guide\nyour opponent, and make it harder for them to\njudge what to do.
Now that you mention it, I have seen Kaltz fake a\npass and get everyone's attention.
Even after I swapped out when we played in\nDresden, the whole team stopped every time\nKaltz made a pass.
That's what I'm talking about. That's my job.
I decide what to do by observing my opponent,\nthough.
I see... Guiding your opponent. That is another\nway to look at it. I need to figure out how to do\nthat.
Wow, Heine's not usually so quick to admit he\nneeds to learn anything. I could get used to this.
That's because if I incorporate your tricks too,\nI really will never lose to you.
I take it back.
I get it. Now that I think about it,\nthe defenders get nervous whenever you pass.
So you just pile those techniques on top of\neach other. So that's why they call you\nKaltz the Trickster!
If my opponents see me that way,\nit only makes it easier for me to do what I do.
They play right into my hands.
Give it a try, <avatar_name>.
It's a lotta fun messing with your opponent's head\nthrough the simplest of actions.
All right, time to get in my exercise for the day.
Huh?
Aren't you...?
Oh, right. Japan's number 23 from the scrimmage.
Wasn't expecting to see you here.\nIs there something I can do for ya?
I came to learn your technique!
I was hoping to play a little.
Oh, a fan of my skills, eh?
You've got a good eye for soccer talent.
Is that so? You are a curious one.
Heh... I mean that in the nicest possible way.
Well, I'd love to practice one-on-one,\nbut today's a full-team practice.
So my apologies, but we'll\nhave to do this another time.
But since I know your face now, you'd better\nshow me something impressive in your next game!
Hey, you came!
I had my eye on you last match.
And what a game!
You've really improved since\nlast time we faced off.
I could even tell how much\nmore driven to win you've become.
Do ya know what the "Japanese spirit" is?
Of course.
What's that?
Wakabayashi liked to talk about it\nwhen we played together in Hamburg.
It's a point of pride for Japanese people.\nIt's their innate warrior's spirit.
Kinda weird for a German guy to be tellin'\na Japanese guy about something like this.
But I guess there must be some truth to\nthe idea because you didn't know about it,\nbut you still seem to have it.
Might not seem like it, but my favorite players\nare those who play with the kinda passion you do.
Use that Japanese spirit to fight\nyour way to the top, <avatar_name>!
Hey! Been waiting for you, <avatar_name>.
I saw your last match,\nand you've definitely got potential.
It's obvious you have some skill, but what\nreally makes you first rate is your Japanese\nspirit.
Playing Japan is a hard fight for sure.\nNot only have they got Wakabayashi and Tsubasa,\nbut every last player has that Japanese spirit.
Not that we're slouches in Germany.\nYou won't see us throwing in the towel.
If you've got your Japanese spirit,\nthen we've got German spirit.
Of course, Schneider and Margus seem overly calm,\nand Schester's always joking around... Heine, too.
But inside them there's a fighting spirit and a\npassion for the game that refuses to be outdone.
And you too, right?
I'd like to see your fighting spirit.
Well... I wonder.
People have called me half-hearted and said\nthat I just kinda go with the flow... Maybe\nI've a surprise in store for those critics, yet.
You mean you haven't?\nC'mon, I'm always on fire during a match!
If you can't tell that, you've still\ngot a long way to go, my friend.
Whoops, looks like it's about time\nfor you to get back to your dorm.
Later!
(Based on these matchups, Germany will\nbe playing Japan in the finals.)
(That's where you'll see my German\nspirit firsthand, <avatar_name>!)
(I can't believe I said all that to <avatar_name>,\nand then we lost before we could show our true\nfighting spirit in the finals.)
(Man... I've never felt so low...)
(But someday Germany will play Japan. I'm sure of\nit! I hope you're looking forward to that day as\nmuch as I am!)
(So next is the finals...\nI look forward to it, <avatar_name>.)
(You of all people might just\nbe able to force me to get serious!)
You're a pretty strange fellow yourself...\nWanting to learn how to shoot from me.
But, well, since you asked so nicely...
First, watch this!
Cool, right? That's my specialty:\nthe Hedgehog Shot.
With the way I play, you'd think it would\nbe some fancy lob shot or something, right?\nAnd that's exactly what I want people to think.
Just because I'm a technical player doesn't\nmean my shot has to be overly technical, too.
That said, I'm also not just\nkicking the ball as hard as I can.
There's a trick to giving it as much impact as\npossible. And that's what I'm going to teach you.
Make sure you get it locked in before you leave!
Sorry to call you out here so early.
Truth is, I figured it was about time\nI told you about my trump card.
I call it the Hedgehog Dribble.
The idea is to lower your center of\ngravity as much as possible while sprinting.\nDribble like that, and they'll never stop you.
I've never shown this move to anyone else\nbefore, let alone taught it. That makes you\nthe first! Be honored.
Think of it as proof of our friendship.\nI'm sure it'll come in handy!
Phew... Sorry to make you run\nso much first thing in the morning.
Anyway, I guess we can look\nforward to another sweaty day! Later!
Oh, so you know Kaltz, <avatar_name>?
He was a key player in Hamburg, along with\nWakabayashi. I've watched him play countless\ntimes, so I'm familiar with his style.
People always say that Hamburg has Schneider\nfor offense and Wakabayashi for defense...
But what really brings it all together\nin competition is Kaltz holding down\nkey areas on the field.
It may seem like he's just lazily drifting about,\nbut really he's assessing the flow of the game,\nand going to the right place at the right time.
Maybe it's a bit too soon to say this about\nsomeone so young, but he's a master of subtly\ncontrolling the field.
Frankly, there's no need for you to imitate his\nplaystyle precisely, <avatar_name>. Rather, try\nto learn to see the flow of a game like he can.
A single play can throw off the course of\nan entire game. That's how soccer works.







Haaah!
Łoł!
There we go!
There it is!
Take that!

Heh. Have to give back to the fans!
What did you expect?
I'll be taking control of the match!
This is what I do.
This is the level I'm at.
Feel the might of the Knight of Bremen.
This is what I'm about!
That's it! This is how we take the lead!
Looking good! Keep the pressure on!
This is our chance to turn it around!
Still tied. Let's turn this around!
Stay alert and we've got this!
First, we have to catch up!
That was a good one!
Excellent!
That's what I like to see!
Oh no...
What was that?!
This ends here!
Now that's a pass!
Mine!
I'll take it from here!
Hup!
Open!
Over here!
Me!
Pass it!
I won't let you!
Ha!
You want the ball? Think again!
Guess who!
I don't lose!
I'm in command of this game, Tsubasa!
What?! Next time, Tsubasa. Next time!
All bark and no bite, Hyuga?
Ugh. Can't underestimate the Tiger, huh?
Hmph. Easy win, Misaki.
What?! This can't be! Misaki...
Trying to be stubborn, Matsuyama?
There's something to you, Matsuyama.
I've got flashy plays, too, Misugi!
Misugi! That was magnificent!
Not even on my radar yet, Sorimachi.
You've got talent, Sorimachi.
Huh. Is that really you, Schneider?!
Dammit! You won't keep me down!
Come at me for real, Kaltz!
You got me good, Kaltz!
I see your whole game, Margus!
You're paying attention, Margus!
Heine! You'll never beat me. Ever!
Ugh! Losing to Heine, of all people!
My skills are unparalleled, Pierre!
No! This isn't the end, Pierre!
You're easy pickings, Napoleon!
Better than I expected, Napoleon!
Hmph! Was that France's Wall, Jean?
Nice footwork! The nickname fits, Jean!
Kluivoort! Don't underestimate me!
Argh, Kluivoort! You're the real deal!
You're inconsistent, Rusciano!
So, this is the real Rusciano?
I figured out your weakness, Carlos!
Ugh! Nice move, Carlos!
Even a genius can't beat me!
So, this is a world-famous prodigy...
You can still do more, Senghor!
You've got good technique, Senghor!
They said you were scarier, Ryan.
He acts like it was nothing!
Relying on your strength again, Blake?
Blake! What terrible strength!
A little fake out and I'm in. Easy.
This time we show 'em how we do it!
So much disrespect!
Take it easy.
Huh? You came to see Schester?
Sorry, but we just started practice.\nCould you come back later?
What is it, Coach?
Oh, Schester. This kid came to see you.
Schester!
Do you remember me?
You were... Oh, yeah!\nNumber 23 for Japan from the scrim.
Umm...
Oh, I remember now.\nYou're Japan's number 23, right?
This is the first time we've\nmet off the field. So, uh...
Nice to meet you.
I hate to say this after you've come all this way,\nbut like the coach said, we're starting practice.\nCould you come back some other time?
Talk to ya soon. See ya!
Sorry about the other day. Today, I'm free though.
Anyway, thanks for coming back,\nhow about we kick the ball around a little?
You've definitely gotten better.
Plus you've got this... aura about you now.
It's not just skill...\nYou've got something else, too.
...
Can I bend your ear a moment?
I'm sure you were picked to rep Japan because\nof how well you played on your original team.
But what would you do if after you\nwere picked, they made you play in a\ndifferent position than you usually did?
I'd definitely hate that.
I wouldn't mind, if it helps the team.
Right?
We're proud of our specific role on the field.\nGiving that to someone else is like telling us\nwe're not good enough. It's a slap in the face.
I mean, I get that it's for the\ngood of the team, but it still hurts.
I see. You're pretty broadminded.
For the team, eh? In my head,\nI understand the rationale, but...
Aww, never mind. You don't need to hear this.
All right! Last, let's face each other one-on-one!
I knew I wasn't seeing things.\nYou're no ordinary player.
You'd be really fun to square off against!
Watching you play also makes me\nrealize how petty I can be sometimes.
Back on my home team, Bremen,\nI played as an attacking midfielder.
So of course I expected to have\nthat position as a rep, too.
But instead they gave that role to Heine, and told\nme to play more defensive at midfield instead.\nI felt like I'd been punched in the gut.
Of course, I still played as hard as\nI could in the new position, but that\ninitial shock stayed with me.
But seeing you play changed that,\n<avatar_name>. I don't feel the same\nkind of dissatisfaction I did before.
The way you put your team first in everything,\nand inspire the other Japanese players...\nThat made me realize something.
What position you play isn't the important thing.\nIt's doing everything you can to help your team\nwin that matters. That's what soccer is about.
You helped me remember that. And then I just\nstopped worrying about my position all the time.
More importantly, it's like I discovered\nnew possibilities within myself. That's\nhow I think of it anyway.
So... Thanks, <avatar_name>.
No need to thank me.
I'm just glad I helped.
Maybe so... I mean, what you really\nwas just play the game the way you felt best.
But I want you to know that you're the\nsort of guy who has that effect on people.
Truly... Meeting you at this tournament\nwas one of the best things to happen to me.
Looking at the bracket, Germany's going\nto be up against Japan in the finals.
So I'll repay you with a lesson on the\ngrandest stage! Make sure you're there!
I'd hoped to repay your favor with a demo of\nmy new attitude in a match, but looks like we\ndropped out early this time.
But we'll get our chance. Someday, somehow,\nwe'll arrive on that fated pitch, and we'll\nget our showdown!
I'll see you in the finals. Then, you can see\nmy new outlook up close. Hope you're excited!
But remember... My team's gonna win!
You've got a good eye, if you\ncan see through my defense.
Ever since they made me a volante for the\ntournament, I've been so focused on defending.
But what I've gotten\nespecially good at is tackling.
Nock an arrow, pull back, take aim, and...\nshoot forward to take that ball.
Well, that's how I picture it anyway.\nToday, I'm teaching you the Arrow Tackle.
For this you'll need a powerful burst of speed,\nthe ability to read your opponent's moves, and\nto accurately slide into the ball.
Now let's get started!
Ha...!
That's it! Don't forget that feeling!
I hope it'll help, <avatar_name>!
(Thinking about this moment\nright here... Isn't this strange?)
(Even though I'm helping my rival improve, all I\nfeel is invigorated at the prospect of more\nchallenging opponents. I can't believe it myself.)
Woohoo! Schester!
Hey, <avatar_name>! You came.\nWanna go kick a ball around a bit?
Schester! Over here! We love you!
We won't be able to concentrate like this.
Hold on a sec, <avatar_name>.\nI have to give these girls some company.
I'll never understand it.\nWhy is he the one that gets drooled over?
Well, that's easy. He's got looks, he shows\nhis fans appreciation, and he's good at soccer.
So he's perfect?
But couldn't you say that of me, too?
Well, I won't deny it, but... I'll deny it.
H-Hold on, Margus, what are you getting at?
(I need to up my swagger!)
(I was already perfect?!)
Sorry for the wait. Now let's practice!
Sorry for the wait. Now let's practice!







Haaah!
Grawh!
Here!
Now!
Take this!
Go!
Choke on this!























Captain!
It's yours!
Don't let me down!
Go!
Full speed ahead!
Idziemy!
Come on!

Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
Wohoo! Score!
Wohoo! Did you see that?
Tak! Feels good, man!
You can thank me for that one.
When I do it, it gets done!
Heh, feels great every time!
Tak! We did it!
Yes! Now, we turn it around!
All right! Keep this up and we win!
See? We scored! Let's keep it up!
It's still tied! Let's get the lead!
We're in the lead! Let's stay cool!
It's not over yet! Let's bring it back!
That was great!
Right on!
More of that!
No!
No way!
Don't let them!
Pass-tastic!
Aw yeah!
Leave it to me!
My turn!
Open!
Here!
Hey, over here!
Pass!
Tak!
Right here!
I am invincible!
Heh, let your guard down, Tsubasa?
Darn it, Tsubasa! You're too good!
I brought the Fierce Tiger down!
Hyuga... You have a hell of a spirit!
I can do at least this much, Misaki!
Some fine technique there, Misaki!
Don't think I lack guts, Matsuyama!
Hah, not bad, Matsuyama!
Little slow today, Misugi. You okay?
That's the Misugi I heard about!
Heh, can't beat me just yet, Sorimachi!
Getting better by the day, Sorimachi!
This isn't like you, Schneider!
You got the skills, Schneider!
Stop kidding around, Kaltz!
Urgh. That's the Kaltz I remember!
See? I can do it too, Schester!
And that's what makes you Schester!
This is why we don't get cocky, Heine.
Your skills are sharp as a knife.
You can't beat me that easily, Pierre!
So, this is Pierre's true talent!
Can't wait for our next match, Napoleon!
Just how good are you, Napoleon?
I'll gladly take on France's Shield!
France' Shield is harder than I thought!
I beat Kluivoort! The rest will be easy!
You'd go this far for me, eh, Kluivoort?
That all you got, Rusciano?!
And I thought you were hot air, Rusciano.
I was expecting more, Carlos!
Carlos has a leg up on me?!
Aren't you supposed to be a prodigy?
I see why you're called a genius!
Hehe, thanks for the win, Senghor!
You're better than you think, Senghor!
You thought it'd be easy, eh, Ryan?
Gah! Why are you so good, Ryan?
I got a little muscle, too, Blake!
How are you so stinkin' strong, Blake?!
I can make shots, too!
The goal is where I shine!
Someone's here to see you, Margus.
Me? Who could it be?
Yo! Umm... Who're you again?
Introduce yourself.
Please, try to remember.
<avatar_name>?
Oh, I remember now! Japan's number 23, right?
Wait, so you came here to meet me,\nbut then ask me to remember you?
But, wait... This is bugging me now...
Hold on... It's on the tip of my tongue...
...
...!
I remember now! Japan's\nnumber 23, right? <avatar_name>!
I guess you really made an\nimpression on me during that scrimmage.
But, uh, I have to go to team practice now.\nSorry about this!
Bye for now! Let's meet again some time!
Hey, <avatar_name>! Your last match was amazing!
I hadn't guessed Asia was\nhiding that level of talent.
Well, that was nothing.
Play your best, too, Margus!
Oh, is that so? Cocky, ain't ya?
Hey! You're not gonna outshine me, ya hear?!
Anyway, would you mind\nhelping me practice something?
I just need you to float the cross toward\nme while I'm in front of the goal.
I'm trying to work on post plays, and I'll use\nwhere you drop the ball as if it were in a game.
Maybe I shouldn't be too haughty, but I'm\npretty darned good at jumping and heading.
That's why I'm a striker on my home team, Bremen.\nBut here they expect me to do post plays, too.
And who I am to let them down?
So anyway, I'm counting on you, <avatar_name>!
Yo! You've got nearly as\nmuch presence as Schneider!
You made a bit of a name for yourself last match!
I didn't think it was anything special.
Come on... I'm no Schneider.
Sheesh, you and that big mouth of yours.\nI don't know whether to be shocked or impressed.
Ha! And so modest, too!
Either way though, keep that up and they'll start\nmarking you something fierce. Just like Schneider.
No matter how good you are, it's hard\nto play well when you're always surrounded.
Schneider is the most outstanding scorer\nin Germany... Maybe, the whole world.
So as a fellow German forward,\nI want to support him.\nWhile still aiming for my own goals of course.
You know, attract a little of their\nattention to give him some breathing room.\nGive him a chance to shoot.
So whenever I get the ball, I try to get it\nto him as smoothly as possible. Or whatever.\nAnything he needs to score.
I'll do whatever it takes for\nthis team to become the champions!
We're gonna just keep winning.
You do the same, <avatar_name>!
I had such high hopes, but things\ndon't always go the way you want...
So this time I'll be cheering you on,\n<avatar_name>! Do your best out there,\nand win that championship!
And then someday, after this tournament,\nwe can face each other for real!
Next up is the finals, <avatar_name>.\nIt'll be our second match, huh?
No offense, but Germany's winning this thing!







Haaah!
Oh, yeah!
Urgh!
Got it!
Hyah!
Ho ho!
Charge!























Captain!
It's on you now!
Get it done!
Go get it!
Drive it home!
Look alive!
Heads up!
Tsubasa!

Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
I can play the field, too!
It'll take more'n that to stop me!
That's what I'm talking about!
I didn't think they'd lemme shoot!
I did it, Master.
Goal? Not bad.
What d'ya think about that?!
No more points for you!
That one point is all we need.
Sorry, everyone. My fault!
Master... I'm sorry!
That's the last point you're getting!
It's all... It's all my fault!
Right on!
Not too shabby!
That's how y'do it!
C'mon!
What the...?!
No further!
There's a pass!
Gotcha!
I'll handle this!
Watch this!
Over here!
Hand it over!
To me!
Pass, now!
There's no shot I can't stop!
This is nothing compared to my training!
I hope you're watching, Master!
Hmph. You're a force, Tsubasa!
Hyuga the Fierce Tiger? What a joke!
Leave art off the pitch, Misaki!
Guts alone won't cut it, Matsuyama!
Weak, Misugi.
Cute, Tachibana. But, so what?
More speed, Nitta! More power, too!
Such a pathetically average spin!
Is that all from the Young Emperor?
Little tricks won't work on me, Kaltz.
Gotta work on those shots, Schester.
Takes more'n that to score, Margus.
You've got spirit, Heine. Little else.
Don't try to spin it past me, Pierre.
You're all talk, Napoleon.
You'll hafta try harder.
Flashy move, but it lacks force.
Is this all Brazil's ace has to show?
What a boring shot, Alberto!
A genius? Maybe in your own lil world.
Victorino? Yeah, you're not scoring.
Try your tricks. They won't work on me.
That shot supposed to challenge me?
Did you really think I had a weakness?
Pretty good power! Needs more training.
I am the world's greatest goalie.
Master said not to look down on others.
My body blocks all shots!
Hey, <avatar_name>. So, last night...
I saw a couple of you guys from Japan here at the\nbeach. What were you doing on an empty beach?
Some kind of tough guy test? What kind of things\nwere you daring each other to do?
I see. So, when it gets hot out in Japan,\nit's normal to test your courage by going to\nscary places?
But if it was your courage you were testing,\nit seems like you were chickening out.
I was a ways off, but I could still tell you were\ngetting cold feet.
No, it was Takeshi's fault!\nHe's such a baby!
I was fine with Takasugi!
Maybe so, but can you really call yourself brave\nif you're scared when someone else is?
Also, the second time you were with that big dude,\nright? You were laughing it up with him.
The truth is you're tough when you've got a tough\nguy with you, but otherwise you get all afraid.\nThat's interesting...
There was that buff dude you were talking with.\nI supposed you were confident and having a\ngood laugh with him.
But don't think I didn't see you with that little\nguy. You were both hunched down scared. I think\nwhat I said is spot on, and anyone would agree.
Acting cocky when you think you're covered,\nbut trembling when you don't...\nYou see where I'm going with this?
You're the sort of person who can't play their\nbest, unless they feel sure about their support.
As for me?
I spent forever up on a mountain all by myself.\nI'd never have gotten by if I were spooked by\nevery little ghost.
You think ghosts are bad?\nYou should see my coach, now he's...
Uh, never mind. Forget I said that.
But going by this conversation,\nI'm now convinced about your play style.
I don't know if you noticed, but lately when\nyour keeper starts slowing down, so do you.\nIt's pretty obvious.
On the other hand, you play harder than ever right\nat the start of the match. That's what I've seen.
You're all peppy when you feel certain of your\nteam helping you out, but if things slow down...\nWell, it's like those tests of courage you did.
Security and anxiety are little more than\nillusions. It's your mind messing with you.\nYou got to do what you can to resist it.
My imagination affects me that much?
Sometimes it can be good, though...
Duh! The way you see something affects you\nand the other team a lot.
If that's how you see it, good for you.\nIt's true you can wield it as a weapon sometimes.
Consider that they call me the Illusionary Goalie.
Because of that, the first time people play\nagainst me, they can be overwhelmed by that image\nof me.
It's surprising how much they end up battling with\nthat illusion.
Then again, I once went against a pro who saw me\nas just a middle school kid and didn't take me\nseriously... Shut that guy down.
Oops, there I go blathering on.
My next match is against you guys.\nMake it fun for me, eh?\nDon't wanna come down the mountain for nothing.
To tell the truth, I didn't envision Brazil\nshooting as much as they did during that match.\nAnd look how many goals I let through.
Playing with a certain vision in your head can\nserve as a spear, but it can also be a weakness.\nLearn that and learn it well.
Now, enough chit chat.\nYou wanna help me out with my training?
I saw a handy boulder over there today. Come on.
Who're you? Didn't anyone\never tell you it's rude to stare?
Oh, that jersey... Japan?
Too bad. There's no way\nyou're winning the finals.
No matter how good your offense, you're\nnot scoring a single point when I'm around.
Anyway, good luck, I guess.
Who're you? Didn't anyone\never tell you it's rude to stare?
...
Sorry, I'm not in much\nof a mood for conversation.
Later.
Who're you? Didn't anyone\never tell you it's rude to stare?
...
Sorry, I'm not in much\nof a mood for conversation.
Later.
Who're you? Didn't anyone\never tell you it's rude to stare?
Oh, that jersey... Japan?
You're never going to get to play me, but...\nWhatever... Good luck, I guess.
Hey, you...
Japan number 23, <avatar_name>, right?
I saw your match. You made an impression.\nI even remember your name.
Uh... Right.
Hey, you...
Japan number 23, <avatar_name>, right?
I saw your match. You made an impression.\nI even remember your name.
Name's Deuter Muller. I'm a soccer player, too.
You got a moment?
How 'bout you tag along for my practice?
Now, listen up. There're a thousand little\npebbles around here. Those'll be our soccer\nballs.
I want you to throw those pebbles at me.\nI'll treat 'em like shots and block all of 'em.
Now c'mon, bring it on!
Phew... That makes 999?
Just one left! Give it all you've got!
Throw it between his legs.
Throw it at his face.
(What, there?)
Heh. Useless. Even if you\naim for that sorta target.
(Yeah... I used to be pretty\nbad at blocking shots like that.)
(But I spent more than half a year doing special\ntraining with my teacher! I've overcome all\nmy weaknesses! I am now impervious!)
Heh. Was that supposed to catch me off guard?
Anyway, that's a thousand, so we're done.
Next'll be penalty kicks, I guess.\nJust keep 'em comin'.
I'll block 'em all with just my left arm.
Wait... We gotta pick up all those pebbles first.
It's no fun diving for the ball when the\nground's covered in rocks, let me tell ya.
How many times're you gonna come here?\nYou're a curious one.
But I can tell you're good. Way better\nthan I'd originally thought. Guess it\nwas worth coming down the mountain.
Until just recently, I was stuck on a mountain\nwith the man who taught me how to play goalie,\nHerr Gunther. He's tough, but fair.
He used all kinds of training,\nlike that pebble thing we did.
But the toughest one of all was...
When he'd drop a ton a rocks off of a cliff along\nwith three balls, and I had to catch all three.
You need three things for that: reflexes to\ndodge the rocks, a good eye to see the balls,\nand the guts not to turn tail and run.
Gunther never talked much, but that's what\nhe must've been trying to teach me. Probably.
Sure was dangerous, though.\nI managed to catch two of the balls, but...
The third was hidden behind\na boulder as big as me.
But I knew it was somethin' I hadta do.
So I stood right under it, smashed\nit with my fist, and caught the ball.
A-Are you even human?!
Y-You're joking, right...?
Eh, seems simple now.\nI guess I'm just not a normal person.
M'not big on jokes. It happened.
Anyway, that's when I was told I could leave\nthe mountain. And now I'm on the German team.
That tough training made\nme what I am today. Invincible.
I don't care how good Japan is...\nYou're not scoring a goal.
If you think you're ready, then bring it on.
Anyway, that's when I was told I could leave\nthe mountain. And now I'm on the German team.
That harsh training's made\nme invincible, I figure.
But that guy... that Brazilian number 10...\nI couldn't stop his shot.
It's my own fault. I was cocky.\nI know that now, better'n anyone.
I've just gotta march back up that mountain\nand get even more training from my master.\nAnd then, next time I'll be ready 'n waiting!
Sorry. This's not really\nimportant to you, I guess.
We didn't get to play each other\nthis time because I wasn't good enough.
But we'll get our chance.\nI hope you're lookin' forward to it!
Anyway, so that's how I got permission\nto leave the mountain. And here I am.
That tough training made\nme what I am today. Invincible.
But I guess I'm out of\nchances to show my stuff here.
So I won't get to stop your\nshot in a real game, either.
But we'll get our chance.\nI hope you're lookin' forward to it!
Anyway, so that's how I got permission\nto leave the mountain. And here I am.
That tough training made\nme what I am today. Invincible.
I don't care how good you are,\nyou're not scoring a goal.
If we ever get a chance to play each other,\nI hope you're ready for that.
You're still nothing special, but you\nreally went all out on defense last match.
I could tell what you were thinking.\n"I've gotta stop this, no matter what!"
You'll never draw out your potential\nwithout the right attitude, that's for sure.
I know that in my bones. Otherwise, I'd\nnever have survived my master's training.
It doesn't matter to a perfect goalie like me,\nbut to a normal goalie, it must be nice having\na defender like you.
Well, good luck next match, I guess.
I saw your match. Your defense isn't half-bad.
But from where I'm standing, you've\ngot a lotta room for improvement.
Okay, you know what, I'll give you some\nspecial blocking training. Stand in front of me.
I'm gonna take a full force shot at you from\npoint blank. I want you to stop it.\nUse your whole body.
This'll give you a body that can withstand\nanything, and the will to face a little pain.
C'mon, don't be shy. I'll train you anytime.
Here I come, <avatar_name>!
That was pathetic! Again!
Here's the last one!
Heh. You survived my whole storm\nof shots. Knew you had it in you.
You've got what it takes to\ntake any shot without fear.
All you gotta do is get in the way.
But you know what? You might even be able\nto handle my master's training regimen.\nI could introduce you, if you like.
Even I have to admit your defense\nlast match was something else.
Japan would've given up a\nlot more goals without you there.
You were fearless out there. No matter how\npowerful the shot, you'd take it for the team,\nwithout hesitation.
Heck, your physical and mental\ntoughness might even be a match for me.
No one can break you anymore.\nStand tall and keep it up.

Are you watching, Dresden?!
That's me! The Magician of Dresden!
That was a nice warm-up!
See that?!
That's it! Let's turn this around!
Time to burn rubber and break through!
Keep it up! We'll turn this around!
We'll be back in the lead in no time!
We're winning, but stay on your toes!
Our chance will come!
Nice moves!
That's it! Keep it up!
Not bad!
Uh-oh!
Oh, no!
Stop them!
Thanks! Nice pass!
Woohoo!
I got this!
Alright! Here it goes!
Got it!
Over here!
Pass it here!
Send it my way!
Don't hog ALL the cheers!
Eyes on me!
Welcome to my Realm of Magic!
Fairy Shot!
Fairy... Shot!
Watch me work my magic!
The star takes the stage!
Time to get down to business!
What will I do with even MORE fans?!
Heavenly Shot! Gooo!
Pierce the heavens!
Heavenly Shot!
Let me show you a dance of the Fae folk!
Just try and catch me!
This'll be good!
Trust me!
Won't stop! Can't be stopped!
Coming through!
C'mon!
C'mon! What's the matter Tsubasa?
Bring it on, Tsubasa!
What chance has a tiger against magic?
Ugh... Fierce Tiger is right!
Haha! Is that all, Misaki?!
Ugh, I was careless!
Your eagle eyes can't track me!
I never saw this coming, Matsuyama!
When do I get a fan club?
I'm not here to make you look good!
Come back with more experience, Nitta!
No one our age is better than me, Sano!
No! I'm supposed to be top of my year!
You won't always win, Schneider!
You don't disappoint, Schneider!
Not to you, Kaltz!
I lost? To Kaltz?!
I'll never accept losing to you!
Not bad, Schester!
Like you could beat me, Margus!
Seriously? Margus outplayed me?!
You hear that cheering? It's for me!
Share some of those fans!
You kinda piss me off, Napoleon.
Ugh, guess you're not just a meathead...
Your shield cannot stop my wizardry!
Good look you got there, Jean!
You're nothing compared to Schneider!
I'll admit, you've got skill, Kluivoort!
Don't blame me, Rusciano!
You look mad... Hope I didn't upset you!
Guess you're not on my level, Carlos!
I'll get you next time, Carlos!
Haha! Guess I'm the superior prodigy!
I let my ego get too big...
Don't feel bad! I'm just that good!
Whoa, not bad, Senghor!
You'll never read me, Ryan!
Oh, you researched me? Are you fan?
Brute strength won't fly here, Blake!
Gah, can't believe he overpowered me.
There's nothing I can't handle!
They'll be cheering for ME in the end!
World, meet the Magician of Dresden!
C'mon, hail to the king!
Fans? Are you out there?
Big crowd out there today.
If there's this many people come to see us even\nafter a loss, that shows you how interesting\nthey think we are.
Let's use this chance to show them what they\nmissed out on during the tournament.
We're considered front-runners for the\nchampionship, and Schneider's in top form.\nOf course, we've got their attention!
Well, we might as well use this opportunity to hog\nthe spotlight a little.
Yeah. Gotta let them know Schneider's not the only\nplayer Germany has.
Now that you mention it, a certain someone is\nbeing awfully quiet considering this crowd.
You're right.
He's usually going around thanking people for\ncoming to see him...
Hmm...
What's going on, Heine? Why the face?
You seemed really upset after that loss recently.\nStill bugging you?
Oh, no, I'm fine now. I mean, I'm still upset,\nbut I can't let that hold me back.
What's on your mind, then?
Well, I was checking out the crowd.
What's wrong, Heine? You seem to be thinking\nreally hard. That's unusual.
Oh, haha, you're hilarious.
I was just observing the crowd.
There's a lot of people here to see Schneider and\nmyself, of course. And though I hate to admit it,\nthere're also some wanting to see Schester.
But other than that, some are seeing the German\nteam for the first time at this tournament.
There's more than a few people curious to see what\nkind of players we have.
I thought you were just being quiet.\nI didn't know you were so introspective.\nDidn't know you thought about that sorta thing.
It's not some "sorta thing."
Listen. If I get a lot of attention here,\nI end up with more fans, right?
Consequently, the number of people curious about\nDresden, my hometown, increases, resulting in more\npeople visiting it.
It's clear cut cause and effect.
Ha! That's a very clever calculation.
But that's just like you. Probably for the best,\ntoo. That attention motivates you.
Okay! I'll play my heart out today, too.
You won't shine brighter than me, though.\nI'm the star of the show, today!
Aw, heck!
(Huh. I'm kinda in the zone today.)
Let's do this, Heine!
Aw, yeah! Check this out!
Eh?! You're pushing the pace now?!
And I'm not stopping!
I'm Cornelius Heine, the Magician of Dresden!
Wow, that Heine kid has some good moves.
Cornelius Heine, was it? I'll remember the name.
Crap... Totally outplayed.
Way to hog the ball.\nI didn't even get to do anything.
...
What's up, Schneider? Salty you didn't get a pass?
Well, I do feel like I missed out,\nbut that's not a big deal.
I was just recalling the Junior Youth Tournament\nfinals where Hamburg and Dresden squared off.
I remember Heine scored on Wakabayashi during\nthat match. He was playing the same way today.
Ah... Yeah.
I also got wrecked that time. He got way too\nexcited. Gave me a real run for my money.
That said, he got injured doing that.\nClassic Heine... he never learns.
Heh.
Thank you all so much for coming out to see me\ntoday!
It's a crying shame Germany was defeated in the\ntournament, and I won't get to show you my gallant\nside anymore.
But you bet the next match we play, I'll be\nbringing some flash like you've never seen!
Come cheer for us in our next match! I'll play\neven better than today and get us that win!
Again, thank you all so much! Vielen dank!
Oh, yeah. If you ever visit Germany,\nmake sure to check out my hometown, Dresden!
Nice. I nailed my spiel today.
Oh, it's just you. I was sure it was a fan coming\nto ask for my autograph.
So, what do you need?
You were on a roll today.
You were a bit over the top today.
Well, what can I say?\nI was playing to a pretty big crowd today.
When that many people come to see you, the\nreaction to good plays is just as big. It gets\nme in a good mood, and then the plays just flow.
Nonsense! What's wrong with getting excited about\nplaying the game? If you can't do it in a big game\nlike today when can you?
Plus, lots of people came to see me today, which\nmakes for big cheers when I play well. And I play\nbetter when I have my fans supporting me.
I know! Since you came all the way to see me,\nlet me teach you how to spot the people in the\ncrowd who are interested in you!
No, seriously. You can totally tell from body\nlanguage and how they act.
What's that got to do with soccer?\nAre you pulling my leg?
For a soccer player, there's nothing quite like\nthe attention you get when you have the ball.\nAm I right or am I right?
If you're not using that attention to motivate you\ninto playing better, you're wasting a valuable\nresource.
Hey, Heine. I'm heading back now.
Okay, I'll head back once I've stretched.
(Hmm, we've been in pretty good shape lately.\nThe rest of the tournament should be fine, so long\nas no unexpected Goliath emerges.)
Wha...? Haven't I seen you somewhere?
Oh, yeah, you're that Japanese player! Come to\nthink of it, pretty sure I saw you during a scrim.
So, what brings you here?
You came to see me? Y'don't say!
Aw, shucks. I'm even making fans overseas now.\nMakes sense. International stardom suits me.
Well then, do you want me\nto sign your jersey, or what?
Actually, I wanted a match with you.
I was planning to take you down a peg.
A match? That's funny.
You're a funny guy! I don't think\nmy confidence even measures up to yours!
I mean, I don't mind taking you on,\nbut I should warn you. You'll need\nto be exceptional to even stand a chance.
So let's start off easy, and we'll see what\nyou've got. Show me your dribble or take a shot,\nand I'll decide if you're worth my time.
Well, well! Looks like you're not all talk.\nYou exceeded my expectations
Then again, they weren't that high to begin with.\nIf you think that's enough to take me on,\nyou're seriously underestimating me.
I'd hate to have to send you home crying,\nso let's just call it now and avoid that\nunpleasantness, eh?
But, you know what? Y'get better by facing tough\nopponents, so you were wise to challenge me.\nCome back when you're a bit more ready.
Alrighty, then. I'll be heading back now.\nIt's busy work being a star!
Hey, <avatar_name>. I saw your game the other day.
Compared to how you were playing before,\nyou're starting to shine a little brighter now.\nJust a smidge, though!
Not quite bright enough to shimmy up to my shine.\nNot just yet. You're gonna hafta show me more.
So, how about I teach you my dribbling technique?
Let's say, if you can learn to do this,\nI'll take you on like you wanted!
Okay, let's practice!
Hmmm... Needs more pizazz.\nYou're gonna have to keep practicing.
Let's call it a day, though. I'm actually in the\nmiddle of rehabbing. Can't be practicing\ntoo hard.
I will say, <avatar_name>,
Y'know you're one lucky guy to get to\npractice and hang out with me like this!
The girls in Dresden would be\ngreen with envy if they knew.
Dresden's a city in eastern Germany, by the way.
It's where I was born and raised.\nI was also the local soccer club's uber...
Let's just say star player. I want to be at least\na little humble. But I will say, I had more\nthan a few fans.
How about you? Do you like your hometown?
Yeah, I love it.
Meh...
Ooh! That's what I like to hear!
Don't go thinking you love your\nhometown more than I love mine, though!
I see. Sorry I asked.
You're like the opposite of me, then.
I don't just love Dresden because I grew up\nthere either. I love its people as much as I\nlove soccer.
That's why I want to make my\nbeloved Dresden famous for soccer!
When people think of German soccer,\nI want them to think of Dresden... and of me.
And to do that, I have to keep working\nhard to earn the world's attention.
Everyone back home's expecting a lot from me,\nactually. Ahh, it's hard being so popular...
But, hey, meeting such demands is what stars do!
You should keep working harder and harder.\nAim for fame!
Look at you! I see you using my technique with the\nadequate amount of pizazz.
Welcome to stardom!
You're finally worthy of a match with me.
Let's get right to it then!
Haha, yeah, that's it!
This is what a match is supposed to look like!
Nicely done! Only one who can go toe to toe with\nme like this, even in Germany, is Schneider.
Okay, that's it for today.
You're not running away... are you?
It is a waste if it's just us, eh?
Aw, and here I was thinking you'd be a worthy\nchallenge. Looks like you still have a lot to\nlearn.
Instead of having a match here where no one can\nsee, we should be doing it in a place that's\nbetter suited for stars like us.
Now, you're thinking like a star!
Having our magnificent match in a place like this\nwhile no one's watching? What a waste!
I know a place more befitting our nascent legends!
The stage is none other than the tournament\nfinals! Is there a better stage than that?\nI think not!
You versus me at the finals will be such\na spectacle the crowd will be going wild!
Of course, whether it's our star battle\nor an actual game, I'll be the winner!
That's right! This tournament's finals! Don't you\nthink it's the perfect stage for our showdown?
Germany's obviously gonna make it to the finals,\nso Japan better pull through, too!
You have to use your strength and lead\nJapan to the finals! Don't let me down!
I thought the finals were going to be the perfect\nstage, but here we are. Germany already lost.
Man! What the heck was I even doing?!\nI can't believe it... We got crushed!
I'm sorry. I found a perfect rival in you and this\nwas going to be our grandiose stage but I blew it.
Oh, but you better believe our\nsoccer story's not ending here.
<avatar_name>, next International Tournament,\nwe'll have our showdown before packed stands.
Just wait and see. I'll be leading\nGermany up on that stage next time!
I'm not letting you have your way, Heine!
Hey now, is it really a good idea\nto gang up on me like this?
There! Schneider, heads up!
Ack, I don't think so!
Psych! Take this!
Whaaa...?!
Now, Schester, did you forget why Bremen lost?\nIt was my goals.
Ugh.
Alright, time to do some stretches and head back.
Oh, hey, <avatar_name>. Came to check out my\npractice and learn a thing or two?\nI admire your drive.
What was that shot just now?
That was an unexpected shot. Impressive.
Interested in my Faery Shot, are ya?\nI knew you showed some promise!
Hey, why don't I show you how it's done?
Haha! Guess I was being underestimated, too!
Here, let me personally teach you\nthe magic of that shot.
See, you have to put some serious backspin on it.
When you do that, the ball will float up,\nas if by magic, slip past the goalie, and\nfly straight into the net.
I'll teach you the trick to it next. After that\nit's all practice, plus some trial and error.
Don't worry. If you've got a knack for it, like\nI do, you'll be able to pull it off no problem!
Then again, if you don't have a knack for it...\nAnyway, we'll see if you've got it or not.\nLooking forward to seeing how it goes!
<avatar_name>, I'm pretty sure you already know\nthis, but the most important thing about\npassing, is ensuring the receiver gets the ball.
Especially, when you spot an opening! Those times\nyou have to get the ball to your teammate\nno matter what.
It's for times like those I have a special pass\nwith great visibility for the receiver.
The trajectory's a little different from a regular\npass, too, so it's harder to intercept, further\nensuring the ball makes it to your teammate.
That said, even if the ball makes it every time,\nif it's hard to trap and turn into a play,\nit's no good.
I make sure to adjust the trajectory\nwith that in mind when I make the pass.
Don't tell me you're surprised I go through the\ntrouble. I thought you knew me better than that.
I'm like a goal magician, just giving everybody\ntheir chance to score. Thought that was obvious.
You could try to be more like me, if you want.\nYou'd be able to create those opportunities.\nI assure you!
Okay, here we go! <avatar_name>!\nLet's try some passes!
(What is this feeling?)
(It's different from when I play with Schneider.)
(It's almost like I'm passing to my clone.)
Wow, look at those two go.
...
For real. It looks really similar to when\nhe and Schneider surge up the field.
<avatar_name>! It's different when I play with\nSchneider, but you and I match up perfectly.
You really are another gifted magician!
I'm amazed to learn that another country had\na magician like you up its sleeve all along.\nJust imagine if we'd been on the same team!
Oh, yeah! Why don't you come to Dresden\nwhen you finish junior high?\nIt'd be a good move for you, I'm sure!
Sup, <avatar_name>?
Sorry I called you up all of a sudden. It's just\nthat I saw a match of yours the other day, and\nI have to tell you something.
You have a gift for soccer... I won't deny it.\nAnd your technique is dope.
But! There is something missing from your plays.
Please, tell me what I'm missing!
Lies. I've got all I need!
Nice. I'm glad you've got that attitude.
Okay, let me break it down for you.
You need to play to the crowd more!
Haha! You've got all you need already?\nHave you set your sights so low? Come on, now.
Listen, I've taught you a couple of techniques and\nyou've picked them all up fairly well.\nThat's impressive on its own.
But! No matter how many techniques you learn,\nif you don't pick up on the essence of my game,\nyou'll never be able to unleash their potential.
The essence of my game, if you will, is in how\nI toy with the opponent, pull some jaw-dropping\nmoves, and please the crowd!
The more the crowd's attention is on me, the more\nhype I get. The more hype I get, the more\npower I can pour into my game.
Then I can use that power to fuel some magnificent\nplays that contribute to the team.
That's the quintessence of\nthe Magician of Dresden.
The pitch is a stage! You're putting on your own\nshow for the crowd. You have to want all eyes\non you when you're performing!
I don't want you just bragging about how good your\ntechnique is. I want you to aim to be that\ncrowd-wowing performer.
That's what using the Magician's\ntechniques is all about.
<avatar_name>, I gotta say.\nThose were some amazing plays.\nYour style's really starting to resemble mine.
Let the Magician of Dresden bestow upon you a\nparticularly enchanting technique that you may one\nday ascend to being a true Magician.
You know the Faery Shot, right? I use it to make\nthe ball float just outside the goalie's reach.
In contrast, the Heavenly Shot heads up and away\nwith serious force and is thrust right into\nthe net, completely evading the goalie.
The ball doesn't stop at the net, either,\nbut pierces through it, going higher and higher\nup to the heavens, until every eye turns skyward.
That's the glimmer of glory\nyou pour with this shot!
You got it? I hope so, cause I'm only going to do\nthis once. I hurt my foot at a game and don't\nwanna make it worse so pay attention.
Engrave what you're about to see into your brain,\nand then practice, practice, practice. Okay?
Okay, this is it! The Heavenly Shot!
Hahaha! Pretty cool, huh? You learn how to use\nthis and your popularity will go through the roof!
Wanna know why I showed you this?
It's simple. Next time we have a game against each\nother, if you're as awesome as I am,\nthe people watching are gonna go nuts.
And then when I beat you,\nI'll become that much more astounding!
So, let's keep rocking the world of soccer!







Haaah!
Gwah!
There!
I see it!
That's it!
Go!
Fly!

I'm winning this match.
Behold our pride!
This is my shot, polished to perfection!
Now's our chance to show off. Ready?
That's it! Keep getting those goals!
That's how we get the lead!
Pull it together guys!
Stay cool! We're still in the lead!
We'll climb back up! Slow and steady!
Exquisite play!
Exceptional!
Beautiful!
How unfortunate!
What in the...?!
Stop right there!
Beautiful pass!
Mine!
I'll take it from here!
Time to shine!
Come on!

This is the moment. Are you with me?

Try as you might, it's futile, Tsubasa!
I'll pay this back tenfold, Tsubasa!
You kick like a beast, Hyuga!
You really surprise me, Hyuga!
You're not getting the best of me, Misaki!
This isn't over, Misaki!
You're no match for me, Matsuyama!
This will not happen again, Matsuyama.
Thought you had me, Misugi?
Ugh! Such exquisite play...
Even you, Schneider! Even you.
We're not square yet, Schneider!
Fine moves, Heine, but insufficient.
Don't mock me, Heine!
I will not be belittled, Napoleon!
Hmph... Good show, Napoleon!
I can read you a mile away, Jean!
Oof... You got the moves, Jean.
I refuse to lose, Kluivoort!
Kluivoort! More than just hot air, huh?
Fierce, Rusciano! But you need more!
Rusciano... such drive!
You have great pride, Robson. As do I!
This is the pride of soccer's homeland!
No matter my opponent, I won't lose!
What?! Very impressive, Carlos!
So much for the self-proclaimed genius!
Urgh, you weren't kidding, Diaz!
Keep practicing, Victorino!
That's the last one, Victorino!
Still not at my level, Senghor!
Agh, you showed me, Senghor!
I'm not quite so simple, Ryan!
I won't make that mistake again, Ryan!
Soccer is more than just power, Blake!
Urgh... There's no stopping him!
There's no rich or poor in soccer!
I'll use all of my skill to topple you!
It's a team sport! No one stands alone!
Show them the soul of how we play!
We can't give our fans an ugly show!
Oh hey, <avatar_name>! What brings you here?
Something on your mind?
Well, I don't mind. Sup?
What drives you to better?
Why's this tournament so important?
It's simple. I love soccer. I love it,\nso I want to be better than everyone else.
Besides, as the captain of the French reps, I have\nthe expectations of an entire country on my\nshoulders.
Whenever I think about restoring glory to France,\nthe energy just comes naturally.\nWell, since you're asking I'm sure you noticed.
You probably know this, but originally France was\nsupposed to host the International Junior Youth\nTournament in August.
But right before it was supposed to happen,\nthis Junior Youth World Challenge stole that\nhonor away from us.
I don't know why it happened,\nbut to France it was humiliating.
Which is why everyone in France wants us to\nrestore the glory that was taken from us.
The French team itself included. We're giving it\nour all to restore our national honor.
Well, since you're asking I'm sure you noticed.
Nowadays, a lot of people focus solely on\ntechnique or physique, and make light of the\nmental aspect of playing.
But let me tell you, willpower is key.
It comes into play especially toward the end of a\nmatch when both sides are exhausted.\nA strong will can make all the difference.
That's why I'm ready to put my body and soul on\nthe line right up until the final whistle.\nThat's how you claim victory. And glory.
...Sorry, that's not really an answer to your\nquestion, is it.\nWell, I just hope my rambling helped a little.
But in that case, how about I prove my point\nduring our next match?
Let's make this one to remember, <avatar_name>.
Even in the match between us, I was ready to put\nmy body and soul on the line right up until the\nfinal whistle.
We didn't manage to claim either victory or glory,\nbut that doesn't mean I had the wrong attitude.
...Sorry, that's not really an answer to your\nquestion, is it.\nWell, I just hope my rambling helped a little.
If you can, try to remember this in the finals.\nI know it'll come in handy.
I'll be cheering for you. Good luck!
What was that?!
Aw, yeah! None of you chumps can stop me!\nHere I come!
That ain't gonna work!
Come on...! I was so close.
I'm not that naive, Napoleon. Remember, the\nworld is full of opponents on this level.
Yeah, yeah... I get it.
Alright, great work guys. Let's take a breather.\nNow, about that thing we found...
I want to test my skills here!
It's on! Me versus France!
H-Hey, that guy from the stands\nis running this way kicking a ball!
What?! This shrimp?!
Did I hear that right?\nIs that shrimp challenging us?
H-Hey, that guy from the stands\nis running this way kicking a ball!
Wait, this is...!
Stay back you guys. I'm doing this on my own!
I think you were... <avatar_name>, right?\nI remember watching your match.
You're... <avatar_name>, right?
Didn't expect you to suddenly challenge us from\nthe stands. Did you hear the story from Misaki\nand decide to try it yourself?
I admire the guts it takes to challenge guys like\nus, but the simple fact is that you're no Misaki.
If you really want to go head-to-head,\npolish up your skills first.
When you feel your truly ready, feel free to come\nback. That's when I'll give you another chance.
We meet again, <avatar_name>.\nCome to challenge me?
Sorry, it's not that I don't remember\nmy promise, but today's a bad day.
Actually, I was about to take part in\na soccer tutorial sponsored as a charity\nevent by Mr. Cardinal.
Can I also join in?
Middle schoolers at a charity?
You interested in that sorta thing, too?\nThat's good.
You hafta give back to your society when you can,\nso I accepted the offer as soon as I heard about\nit.
I got an idea. How 'bout you come with me?
Taking part in social events overseas is\npretty handy experience for the future, too.
Now, come on. Idziemy!
Look at all those reps from so many countries. I\nguess everyone's interested in this sort of thing.
This is the assembly hall for the\nsoccer tutorial. You can be my assistant.
Don't be intimidated just because it's a class.\nWe just have to teach them how fun soccer can be.
Now, let's not keep 'em waiting.\nLet's get this show on the road.
Ha ha! There were no allies or enemies today.\nI never though I'd get to have so much fun in\nthe middle of a cutthroat tournament.
Seeing everyone enjoying themselves so much\nreminds of when I first started playing soccer...
I was born into a rich family. And no one ever let\nme forget it. People either gave me a hard time or\ntried to suck up to me.
It got to the point where everyone\naround me disgusted me.
But that's when I first encountered soccer.
It's a game where everyone chases the same\nball on the same field with the same rules,\nregardless of race or social class.
Seeing everyone play today reminded me of that.\nSoccer really is amazing. And I love it.
And I can tell that you really love soccer, too.
You made a pretty decent teacher, too.\nI was even more impressed by how quickly you\nfit in with everyone else right away.
Not to mention I got a good look at\nyour technique. You got real talent.
Next time, let's go one-one-one for real.\nThat'll be a day of days.
Sorry for the sudden change of plans for today,\nbut thanks for coming along.
Next time, let's meet on the field!
So next up for you is the finals, huh?\nWin it for us, too!
Hey, <avatar_name>, practice is already over,\nbut could you join me for a sec?
Hey, <avatar_name>.
I still haven't fulfilled\nmy promise to you, have I?
You're free now, right? Let's hit the pitch.
Misaki, you should see this, too. Join us.
Got it.
When we first met, I beat\nyou by beating your dribble.
But in our game, your team won. I don't\ndistinguish between team and individual\nlosses, so the score's tied one to one.
That means today, we'll\nsettle this once and for all.
Listen up, <avatar_name>. I want you to dribble\ntoward me again, and I'll try to take the ball.
Now, bring it on!
Ugh... Not bad...
But I'm not done yet!
Seems evenly matched... Wait...!
This one's mine, <avatar_name>!
Pierre...
Impressive, Pierre.
And I really thought I had a shot!
No... I should be the one praising you.
Your frustration is natural.
True, I may have won again,\nbut today was definitely different.
Last time, I got the ball off you in an instant.\nBut this time, it took every ounce of my skill.
I mean to say, our little contest proves just\nhow much you've improved over the tournament.
Put your heart into the finals and keep growing.\nDo that and maybe next time, you'll be a step\nahead of me.
Pierre...
<avatar_name>... Misaki... Win the finals.
And the next time we meet,\nI'll be the one challenging you.
Til next time, fellas.
(I wasn't able to win the tournament this time,\nbut I did get to meet <avatar_name>.\nThat may mean something down the road.)
(Heh... Just another thing to look forward to.)
(But next time... Next time, my team's gonna win!\nJust wait, you two!)
Grah! You're sure shapin' up to be a tough one.
I can even slip past you, Jean. There's no\none at this tournament who can stop me now.
Ha ha! Thank you for saying so.
That footwork of yours is practically high art.
I want to copy that footwork!
If I could do that, I'd be unstoppable!
Oh? Isn't that <avatar_name>?
Judging by that look on your face,\nyou're here to steal my techniques.
Isn't that <avatar_name>?
Coming to watch us practice?\nQuite the dedicated student...
Heh, oh well.
Hey, <avatar_name>! Come down to the field!
I'll teach you the trick\nbehind that footwork I just used!
Have a taste of my Cannon Shot!
No!
You can't stop me!
N-Nice one, Pierre!
Tch. C'mon, Pierre, at least let me\nscore a nice, juicy goal in practice.
Heh. My body reacts on instinct. It's because\nI always train like it's a real match.
Bah. You've got heart, but taking\na little hit won't win you the game.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, it's you. I saw you in the stands.
Need something?
Why go for such a reckless block?
Why not just leave it to the keeper?
Oh, that? It's just a reflex by now.\nWhen you're on defense, you have to assume\nyou'll be blocking shots sooner or later.
Well, I guess you could do that...
But no goalie is perfect, right? Sometimes they\nlet one through or bounce it back into play.
A shot on goal always increases the risk of\ngiving up a point. So the safest option is to\nnever let the ball get that far.
When you're on defense, you need to prepare for\nall kinds of possibilities, so you're always\nready to react no matter what happens.
Well, I'm making this sound all complicated\nwhen it really boils down to thinking\n"no way am I letting you score!"
Don't worry about your form too much.\nRemember, you can block a shot with any part\nof your body besides your hands.
Force your body into action, especially when\nthings seem most dire. Now, show me just how much\nyou want to help your team.
Here we go, Napoleon!
Got it!
Great! If we can manage that,\nthen we're good as gold.
It's you and me, Pierre.\nIt's how it's meant to be.
Well, maybe not quite. It never hurts to practice.
Hey, man! What is it this time?
Please, teach me how to do that!
I want to try that with you, Pierre!
Hmm... Even if you ask nicely,\nit's not so simple...
I'm glad to hear that,\nbut it takes some work, y'know.
Obviously you need speed and technique, but more\nthan that you need to sync to your partner's\nrhythm. You need to know where they'll want to be.
But if you're really that interested...\nFine, let's go to the field.
I'm going to pass it to you while running full\nspeed, okay? You run as fast as you can, too.
Here we go!
Whoa...!
Sorry. I thought I understood what level you\nwere playin' at, but it looks like I was still\nunderestimating you.
To be honest, I was pretty sure you weren't\ngoing to be able to keep up. That was amazing.
Heh... You would've made a\ngood partner were we teammates.
Maybe we'll get the chance to team up someday.\nIf that ever happens, I'll be counting on you.
Alright guys, we're checking our formation.\nRegulars get to your positions.
We don't know who's watching, Pierre.\nYou sure this is okay?
I don't mind. Even if we're spied on, we just\nhave to play our way the best we can in the match.
Well, if you say so. Let's get started then.
If we manage to steal the ball,\neveryone switch to Blitz formation!
Yeah, you're on!
Alright, let's do this!
Hey, where're you going Pierre?\nHeadin' back early?
Yeah, we'll be out here until it's time for chow.
Heh, I knew it. I saw you watching before,\nso I figured you'd come for a visit.
You're right, I have something to ask.
Whoa, you read me so easily...
Let me guess... You wanna know about the\nBlitz formation we were just running, right?
It's easy to see how thirsty you are to learn.\nIf something in soccer interests you,\nyou come running. It's as simple as that.
Now let me see...\nYou wanna know about the Blitz formation, right?
Blitz is when, at the captain's command,\nthe whole team temporarily converges and\nsprints toward the ball and the goal.
We up the pressure using every player on the\nfield. Just like it sounds, it's an assault.
French players definitely have skill,\nbut our play can be a bit passive at times.
But when the captain gives a firm command,\nthe hesitation immediately dissolves,\nand our team's true potential emerges.
That's the purpose of this strategy.
Must seem strange for me to be revealing\nthis about our team to a future opponent.
But there's one thing you need to understand.\nI have the confidence that even if you know\nall this, we can still come out on top.
I'm really looking forward to our match.\nI won't hesitate to go all out against you,\nso don't you hold back either.
When the day comes for you to lead your own team,\nI hope this strategy serves you well.
Anyway, let's not get ahead of ourselves.\nHave to focus on the finals first.
Don't you dare lose, <avatar_name>.
<avatar_name>!\nCongratulations on making it to the finals.
So what brings you here today?
You were amazing in the semifinals.
Could I give commands like that?
Heh, thanks.\nI hope we at least gave you guys a challenge.
But I doubt you came here just to praise me.
You're here to learn about our Conqueror strategy?\nSheesh, you're so hungry it scares me sometimes.
Let's see... Well, this'll take some effort.
But you might end up leading your own team\nsomeday, so it's important to learn this sort\nof thing.
Alright, I'll teach you how Conqueror works.
You remember the Blitz I taught you earlier,\nright? That's the strategy where the whole\nteam pressures the opponent with our speed.
Conqueror is like that, except we trample\nour opponents with raw power, instead.\nLike... a conqueror.
By having the whole team unsheathe their claws all\nat once at just the right moment, we can put a lot\nof pressure on the opposing team.
But you'll need a wealth of experience from a lot\nof matches to get a handle on when to give the\norder. That you'll need to study on your own.
Train yourself to follow the flow of the match and\nidentify the key moment. You'll definitely be able\nto find the timing then.
One last thing... I hope you'll remember\nthis for when you're leading a team...
But these sorts of full team commands only work\nwhen the entire team trusts you as their captain.
If they don't, you won't be able to rally\ntheir strength no matter what you say.
That's why I make sure to carry myself with\ndignity in front of the team,\nboth on the field and off.
I have high hopes for you.\nI'm sure you can become an exemplary captain.
Hey <avatar_name>!\nSorry for dragging you out here.
I have a favor to ask you.
I came up with a new move to take on Misaki, get\nrevenge on America for stealing our tournament,\nand win the championship for France.
I first put it on display in our\nmatch with Japan, the Étoile Roulette.
I... want you to take that\nmove to the finals with you.
You've mastered my style of dribbling,\nso I'm sure you can pull off this feint.
So how about it? Want to try it out?
Right, I won't let you down!
Shouldn't it be Misaki?
Thanks. I'm glad to hear that.
Now, we don't have much time,\nso let's get started.
Misaki and I have completely different styles,\nso he'd struggle with my techniques.
And really... The best of all possible worlds\nwould be to face Misaki with him believing\nwholeheartedly in his own technique.
Eventually, you too will... Well, never mind.\nLet's get started, shall we?
It's a problem if you can't slip past\nyour opponent while maintaining speed.\nYou need to be conscious of that.
This time your ball control was beginning\nto falter. Preserve both speed and precision.
Now, you've got it!\nThat'll serve you well one on one.
All that's left is learning when to use it\nin a match. Practice that part on your own.\nYou won't regret it, I promise.
And... thanks.\nFor taking the time and humoring me.
Hey, <avatar_name>. Heading to practice?
Me? I've got a little time,\nso I thought I'd head to a nearby art museum.
Are you interested in art?
Shouldn't you be training?
I've had an interest in art and music since\nI was a child. I can even play the piano.
I think it's nice to have hobbies to\nenjoy outside of soccer once in a while.
I can see where you're coming from, but taking\nsome time off for a change of pace keeps me\nmotivated to play soccer, too.
Devoting yourself to soccer is great and all,\nbut don't you think maybe being exposed to\nsome art could give you fresh inspiration?
Hang on... I have an extra ticket I could give\nyou. Want to come with me?\nIf you have the time, of course.
If you have an interest in the arts, you\nshould see if there's something you can use.
In your case, maybe art will give you some\nnew ideas and add new depth to your play.
I can't wait for the day we play each other,\nand I can see for myself what you've come up with.\nWell, I'm off. Bye.
I'm looking forward to seeing if this bears\nfruit in the finals. Well, I'll be off now. Bye.
<avatar_name>, are you confident that you've\ngot a good handle on using the Slider Shot?
Right, it's my trump card.
I can shoot it whenever I want now.
I'm pleased to hear that, but I'm a little\ntroubled that you seem content not to grow.
Oh, I know. If you've mastered that,\nthen why don't we move on to the next step?
It shouldn't be a problem to teach\nyou the evolved form of it, too.
True, it's hard to judge the trajectory of the\nSlider Shot, but there are some amazing goalies\nout there. It doesn't guarantee a goal on its own.
So that's why I took it to the next level.
I call it the Dual Slider Shot.
It has the same trajectory as before,\nbut you add an intense spin to it.
That way, it'll have an incomparably sharper\ncurve, and it'll bounce up from the ground that\nmuch harder.
You can also mix it up with the ordinary\nSlider Shot to keep the goalie on their toes.
But in order to add to the spin while keeping the\ntrajectory, you'll need more technique than you\nthink. The kick also puts a strain on your legs.
Anyway, I'll teach you the how,\nbut putting it all together is up to you.
You think I'm not being helpful enough? Well, art\nis only meaningful if it's your own expression.\nShow me you can do more than copy others.
It all comes down to your aesthetics.\nI have high hopes for you, y'know.







Oh, ho!
Łoł!
I said go!
Opportunity knocks!
Here I am!
Eat this!

Aw yeah, baby!
Woohoo! I did it!
When I play, loss isn't a concern!
Heh, I'm different from those losers!
World's best striker, right here!
Oh, yeah! You all saw that, right?
Louis Napoleon. Remember the name.
Now, the match really starts!
We're just warming up!
Yes! Watch me turn this around!
Heh, we'll be taking back control now.
Hehe, so now we extend our lead again.
If you wanna win, you get me the ball!
That's what I'm talking about!
Nice!
Look at you go!
That's bad!
What?!
Halt!
Explosive!
Gotcha!
On it!
Okay, here I go!
Over here!
Give it!
Hey! Come on!
I said pass!
Chew on this!
This is the one!
You're mine!
Here it is, Cannon Shot!
Cannon Shot!
Cannon Shot!
Time to go all out! Full power!
This one's charged to maximum smash!
Just try to stop this one!
My Cannon Shot will rip right through!
Cannon Shot destroy my foes!
Time for an explosive Cannon Shot!
Make a path!
I said move!
Can't catch me!
Wait, is that it? C'mon, Tsubasa!
Man, you're good. Next time, though!
Napoleon: 1. Hyuga: 0.
It won't go your way next time, Hyuga!
I know all your moves, Misaki!
Classic Misaki!
Wholly unimpressive, Matsuyama!
The heck?! You've got moxie, Matsuyama!
Cuttin' you no slack, Misugi!
What in the... That was stunning!
What was that about an Ace Killer, Soda?
No more freebies, Soda!
Thanks for being number two, Schneider!
No! I'm supposed to be number one!
Magician?! Ha! I'll make you disappear!
I'll be bringing the pain, Heine!
Heh, I know you can do better, Pierre!
Tch, that's Pierre, huh? ...Cool!
You're gonna lull me to sleep, Jean!
Jean! You just had to go and do that!
I was expecting more, Kluivoort!
Just wait, Kluivoort! Next time!
Come on, Rusciano! You're no amateur.
Rusciano... I'll pay you back soon!
Get on my level, Carlos!
It won't be so easy next time, Carlos!
Looks like I outwitted the genius!
Don't get too excited, Diaz!
Got you shaking in your cleats, Senghor?
Senghor, you cheeky little...!
You really are just a twerp, Ryan!
What the...?! Ryan, you little...!
Level up your game and try again, Blake!
You're just a brute, Blake! That's it!
The hell do you think you're doing?!
Eh, it's just your average play.
Napoleon is number one!
The Goddess of Victory is smiling on us!
Hey, don't just stand there! Idziemy!
Next, we'll split into offense and defense for a\nlittle practice game. Assume we're twenty minutes\ninto the second half and tied.
I want you to treat this just like a real game,\ngot it?
Got it!
Okay, you've held out for ten minutes.
My bad...
Man, what the heck was that? Were you even trying?
If a shot like that can slip into the goal,\nthen our goalkeeper could get scored\non super easily!
H-Hey! I’m a regular goalie\non the rep team, you know! 
I'm doing my best, too! I was treating it like\na real game so I shot for the corner.
Ha! Listen to yourself. You really woulda went\nfor a half-baked shot like that in a real game?
Sure, a striker's gotta have the skills,\nbut even before that you need the right mindset!
Ugh... I guess you're right.
I'm a forward too, but even before you got here,\nI used Pierre as a crutch to score. At some point,\nI just started thinking of it as natural.
So you're right, I need to work on my mindset as\na forward before I worry about my other skills.
Good, you finally realized it.
Alright, how about a few tips from the master\nthen?
Oh? I've never heard you talk about this before.\nI'm curious too.
Then, listen up, cuz I won't say it twice.
Oh hey there, <avatar_name>. Great timing.
I was right about to tell this guy here how\na REAL striker thinks.
You need to hear this, too!
Let's assume the same setup as our practice match:\nwe're tied and the game's almost over.
When it's down to the wire like that, you don't\naim for the corner, you should shoot so it'll make\nit in, even if you don't have perfect precision.
If you miss the goal completely you've got zero\nchance of scoring. If you're square,\nat least then there's a chance.
Plus, when the game's tied the goalie's feeling\nthe pressure, too. Every shot has him sweating\nbullets.
Which means even if your shot goes off course a\nlittle, there's pretty good odds that the goalie's\ngonna screw up anyway. And then you win.
I see... I never thought of it like that.
Other than that, try to aim at where the goalie is\nweakest, if ya can.
Where he's weakest?
A lot happens over a tough game. The goalie's arms\nor wrists or legs or SOMEWHERE must be getting\ntired or beat up.
So aim for that side of him and kick the snot out\nof the ball. A match like that gets real tense at\nthe end, that puts strain on his body.
So even if you don't get the goal,\nyou're still softening him up.
So next his reactions'll be even slower,\nand your odds of scoring go up even more.
I get what you're saying, but shooting to hurt\nsomeone seems kinda...
Hey now, don't get all soft on me! When you're on\nthat field, it's score or eat grass!
This is exactly why you can never score,\neven in practice.
Ugh... Easier said than done.
Bossis, while you don't need to be as ruthless\nas Napoleon, he's got the right idea.
What you should take away from this is that you\nneed to pay attention to the state of the game\nand the condition of your opponents. Play smart.
If you watch close and notice that their goalie\nis feeling tired or hurt, you can use that to\nyour advantage.
That's what you meant, right Napoleon?
You've got a mind like a steel trap.
Plus, if you wanna go pro, taking advantage of\ntheir weaknesses is just common sense.\nWe gotta use whatever we can to get that edge.
Of course, I know you have your own way of doing\nthings, Bossis. We can't force you to do anything.
I just hope you realize how much Napoleon is\nalways thinking about optimizing scoring,\nand that you'll try to use that for reference.
Yeah, gotcha.
Even a goodie-two-shoes can do that much, right?
But how about you, <avatar_name>?\nYou know I'm right, don'cha?
Yup! Tear 'em apart!
I mean, within reason...
You're kinda... extreme, huh?
That's what I like to hear!\nI knew I could count on ya, <avatar_name>!
But like Pierre was saying, it does you no good\nif you aren't keeping a close eye on 'em.
See? I'm not the crazy one here, am I?
You say that, but you really mean you don't got\nthe guts for it, don'cha?
If you wanna be the world's best striker,\nyou need a sharp eye like yours truly.\nJust like what Pierre was saying.
A striker's job is to score goals.\nIf you can't do that, then why are you playing?
...
Well, whatever. I play my way, and you play yours.
Just listen to Pierre. Whether you do what he says\nor not is up to you, but it can't hurt to learn\nabout what he thinks.
Eh? No way! Ya can't even\nstop a sloppy shot like that?
Grr! Wh-What was that?!
What, you got a problem? How about you complain\nafter you can stop even one of my shots!
Dangit, I'm doing my best here, too!
Ha! That's the best you can do?\nDon't make me laugh.
Huh? Who're you?\nWe're in the middle of practice so get lost.
He's trying... cut him some slack.
You're right... What a hopeless goalie.
Did I ask for your opinion?\nFancy way of pickin' a fight you got there.
N-No way, even this outsider...?
Ha! You've got guts, kid!\nComin' over here just to say something like that?
Hey, knock it off, Napoleon.\nYou can't just say whatever you want.\nI'll hafta tell Pierre about this later.
Tch, fine. Why you always gotta bring up Pierre?
Hey, you.
Looks like you're a little better than the rest\nof these chumps. Got guts, too. I like you.
Stop by later, and if I've got time\nI'll show you what I'm really capable of!
Hey now, what was with that shot?
I'm amazed you thought you could get\nanywhere near the goal with that, idiot.
This is all because Pierre used to pamper you guys\nbefore I got here. I'm embarrassed to be on the\nsame team.
Grah! Everyone's going all out.\nWhat else can we do?
Excuses, excuses!\nI'm hearin' nothin' but excuses from you guys!
Well, France only needs me\nand Pierre on offense anyway!
I-I'm a forward too! I was also chosen to\nrepresent France! I'm not here to lose!
Well, good luck with that.
Now how about you let me do my thing?
Not that I can talk...\nIt's partly my fault that we lost.
Next tournament, I'll definitely be more useful!\nI know I just need to keep at it!
Yeah? Well, good luck. I'll do things my way.
Oh hey, you really came.
I came to show off what I can do.
You're fighting again?
Heh. Someone's confident.
Fine by me. Time to see for myself if you really\nare better than the rest of the scrubby players.
Bah, you for real? If ya don't like it,\nthen get good enough to make me shut up.
Or are you just another nobody?
Cause if not, you'd better prove it to me.
Bah, I guess you're okay. Better'n them anyway.
Alright, you can be my training partner.\nIt'll be way better practice than these chumps.
Hey, don't just zone out over there. Follow me!
The heck's wrong with saying I wish we'd made it\nto the finals?! Don't come after me for every\nlittle thing!
Didn't we say that we don't have time to be\nthinkin' about what-ifs? What do you think\nyou're doing, riling us up like that?
Shut up! I can say what I want!\nI just said what I was thinkin', that's all!
I wouldn't have to, if you\ndidn't keep saying stupid things.
What was that?! Why you little...
You're always fighting.
Seems like you two get along.
All of you are starting to piss me off!\nI did nothing wrong!
Good grief! What're you all doing?
You're the one always picking a fight,\nand saying stuff to tick us off.
What part of this looks like gettin' along?!\nThis guy's always picking a fight with me!
See! He's still doing it!
It's not my fault you make everything\nout to be fighting words right away!
Sheesh... Do you even realize how much\nof a pain you are for the rest of us?
Well, I ain't falling for it! You know\nwhat I'm talking about! I'm not like you!
Hey, <avatar_name>! I wanna train to clear\nmy head. Idziemy! You come too, Jean!
Hmph. Fine.
You really shouldn't be hanging out with this guy,\n<avatar_name>. He's not what you'd call a good\ninfluence.
I can hear you, Jean!
But I am serious about this.
Ha, you're good <avatar_name>.\nI can see why you beat us.
Jeez, Japan was strong. And here I thought\nFrance was coming together as a team.
The team was in a real bad state before I joined.\nEveryone just relied on Pierre for everything,\nlike that was perfectly natural.
We never woulda won an international championship\nlike that. I figured I had to change the way they\nsee themselves.
Wait, so all your harsh\nremarks to the team were...?
You were trying to encourage them? Like,\n"if you don't wanna hear this, then get better?"
Heh. Explain it yourself then.\nI ain't gotta do it for you.
Hey, <avatar_name>! You beat us, so I ain't gonna\nforgive you unless you win this whole thing!
And next time we fight, we're winning!\nJust you wait!
Thanks for tagging along to train with me.
You've gotten a little better, too, Bossis.\nYou can keep up with my passes now, yeah?
Yeah, I'm a French forward, too!\nI can't just hang a hammock and relax.
Heh. You're busting your butt to keep up.
Guess we'll get some dribbling in.\nYou come, too, Jean.
Well... Can't cut corners.
Gah, today's not my day.\nI can't believe you got past me.
Heh, bark all you want. If you think you can\nstop me at will you've got another thing coming.
Sheesh, I need to get back to my own practice.\nThis won't happen again.
What, you wanna be my opponent\nthis time, <avatar_name>?
You're surprisingly good at passing.
You're pretty good at dribbling.
And what's surprising about that? Wait, don't\ntell me you thought I was only good at shooting?
Hmph. Don't you look down on me.
They ain't my specialties, but I'm top tier\nin passing, dribbling, and even defense.
Actually, the only player on the\nteam who can keep up with me is Pierre.
Well, I gotta admit that Pierre's\nbetter at dribbling and passing.
But I'm better at shooting!\nSo don't ya think I'd better of focusing on that?
If you wanna be first rate, you'd better focus on\none thing, too. Doesn't matter what it is,\npolish everything.
Could be shooting, could be dribbling.\nDoesn't matter if you step on some toes.\nWin folks' trust so hard their heads'll spin!
Okay, come train with me.\nYou'll be on my level in no time.
Yo, <avatar_name>. Back already?\nSomeone's chompin' at the bit.
Expect to improve a lot\nwith your frequent trips here?
Right, all thanks to you.
Nah, it's all my own skill.
Heh. No duh. I mean, you're playing\ndirectly with a first rate player like me.
Guess the little chick's growing a spine. Not bad.
Okay, I wanna try something out. Come with me.
Bossis! Jean! We need a few more people!
Hmm? Jeez, and here I was wondering\nwhat you were up to.
So me and <avatar_name> are gonna do\na combo pass and try to get past you all.
So you guys just try and stop us.
Sounds fun! Zróbmy to!
C'mon, <avatar_name>!
What'd you say?
That team play...!
Hmph. As I thought.
No way, you came up with that on the spot?\nThat guy's the genuine article.
Guess it takes talent to see talent. We both\ncompletely matched each other's rhythms, and\nimprovised some impressive passing.
So basically, that bit of teaming up\nproves to me that you're first rate, too.
The only one in France who can mesh with my\nplay is Pierre, which makes you a rare breed.
We could do this all the time if we were\non the same team, but... Whatever, we'll\nget our chance... someday.
Bah! Well aren't you in a good mood today, Amoros?
Heh, of course I can stop a lame shot like that.
Ha ha! What's wrong Napoleon.\nWeren't you supposed to make every shot?
Hmph. After hearing you always run your mouth in\npractice, I'm not expecting much come game time.
Oh, don't give me that,\nwe all miss kicks sometimes!
What's with this free kick training junk anyway?\nThis ain't my style!
Alright! If you're gonna laugh then...\nWe've got one, two, three, four...
And Amoros makes five. All five of ya come at me\ntogether! I'll get past you all and score a goal!
Desperate, huh? Interesting. Bossis, weren't you\nand the others going to show him what's what?
As hotheaded as ever. I wonder what\nexcuse you'll come up with after you lose.
Shut up! I said I'll do it, so I'll do it!\nNow hurry up and get ready!
Sounds fun. Can I join too?
Can I see how you deal with this?
You too, <avatar_name>? Alright, you\njoin their side. This'll be six-on-one!
Oh, you were watchin' us, <avatar_name>?
Alright, then join their side\nand learn first hand!
Aaah!
Now bring it on! A wimp is a wimp, and no\nnumber of 'em is ever gonna be a match for me!
I'm not like the others! Take this!
Heh. I'll blow you away with a Cannon Shot, Jean!
What?! You're faster than before!
Ugh! H-He's fast!
Woo! That's the stuff! I can't get my blood\npumpin' unless I'm surrounded on all sides!
I can't believe you get even stronger when\ncornered... And here I was thinking we'd finally\nget a chance to show you up in practice.
Heh. Never thought I'd hear that from you.
So, that help you out any, <avatar_name>?\nThe important thing is to always keep fightin',\neven when you're surrounded and outmanned.
Actually, getting to deal with all\nthose guys at once gives you a chance.\nThat's when it counts, you hear?
Now's your chance, Napoleon! Counting on you!
Yeah, just leave it to me!
I'm open, Napoleon! Pass!
No, I just have to break through!
Now's my chance!
Score!
C'mon Napoleon, you saw I was open, didn't you?\nHow come you didn't pass?
Hmph. It's 'cause by then I stopped thinking\nabout anything but breaking through. That's\nwhat made me so sure I could make it.
I get where you're coming from Bossis, but we have\nto acknowledge Napoleon's ability to score goals.
Teamwork is important, but aggressively chasing\nevery opportunity is a strategy, as well.
Oh... I see. I'll work hard so\nI can make passes from there, too.
Still, Napoleon... Keep playing as you have\nand you'll hurt team morale. Understand?
Heh. Strikers have gotta be a little selfish.
Who ever heard of a humble striker?\nThere's no glory or point to that.
Listen here, Napoleon. Aesthetics are one thing,\nbut if you act selfishly, no one will even want\nto pass you the ball.
Heh. When that happens, I'll just score by myself.
Come see me in my room once we\nget back to the dorms. Sheesh.
Selfishness causes a lot of trouble.
What's wrong with a little selfishness?
I know what you mean, but I can see\nwhere Napoleon's coming from, too.
For a striker, no matter what anyone else says, as\nlong as you're scoring points you're in the right.
That's what it means to be a striker.
As long as you're getting goals,\nyou're in the right.
(But if you're going to run your mouth like\nthat, you need the skill to back it up.)
(I gotta step up my game, too!)
Hey, <avatar_name>.\nYou were practicing my Cannon Shot, right?
Then remember this... It's a super high level\ntechnique requiring both intense spin and power.
Even my teammates always get it wrong. They\ncomplain I'm just kicking it with everything I've\ngot. Don't be fooled because it looks direct.
We needta show the world just how\namazing the Cannon Shot really is.
Which is why I'm gonna teach\nyou how to kick it up a notch.
I call it the Vendémiaire Cannon!
Basically, you turn up the torque on the\nspin without sacrificing speed or power.
It takes serious precision, and it's tough\non your legs, so you can't use it much...\nBut it is a beast.
Heh. I'm teachin' you personally, so I hope\nyou appreciate it. Use it to blow 'em all away!
If you can pull this off...\nI'll acknowledge you as my number one disciple!







Haaah!
Unf!
There!
I see you!
Take that!
Here I go!
Now!























Captain!
Up to you now!

Here we go!
Let's get it!

Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
Nice to get a goal once in a while.
I bet you thought I could only defend.
You call that a defense?
Blame your defense.
Even I can handle this much.
I'm not just a defender!
You let your guard down.
I'll protect our goal, so you go score!
Keep it up!
It's not over yet!
I can't believe I let this happen.
It won't happen again!
It's too early to give up!
Nice work!
Nice!
Very good!
Not good!
What the--?!
Stop them!
Nice pass!
Thanks!
I'll handle it!
Idziemy!
Over here!
This way!
I'll take it!
Pass!
Thought you'd get past me?
That's MINE! Thank you very much!
I don't think so!
Got it!
Not while I'm here!
Useless!
Get back here!
Bring it on!
You won't get past me!
Hmph, is that all, Tsubasa?
Not bad, Tsubasa!
A tiger needs more than claws, Hyuga!
Gah, so this is the Tiger?
You're letting Pierre down, Misaki!
So that's what Pierre sees in you!
Not today, Matsuyama!
You're more steadfast than I am?!
You're no Pierre, Misugi!
Astounding!
You're not faster than me, Nitta!
You were... faster?
I win, Emperor or not!
So this is the Young Emperor?
I'd never lose to a guy like you!
Beaten by a clown?!
C'mon, you're better than that, Pierre!
That's Pierre for you!
Naive, Napoleon!
How is this my Waterloo?!
Not to you, Kluivoort!
I lost...? You're amazing!
I see what you're up to, Rusciano!
He outplayed me?!
Good can't top perfect!
So you're the infamous Carlos, huh?
I'm disappointed, Diaz!
Guess you're not all talk!
Come at me, Black Panther!
Holy cow, Victorino!
That self-doubt is your weak point!
Senghor, huh? I'll remember the name
What happened to your epic plan?
You predicted my moves?!
You need more than strength!
Ugh, I need to train more!
Hmph. Child's play.
They're not scoring while I'm around!
I'll handle the defense!
We'd win even if I sat out.
Okay! Next up, we'll pit our starting offense\nagainst our starting defense!
Treat it just like a real match! Got that, guys?
Got it!
(Now it's just Jean by himself at the back line.)
Here, Bossis!
Just shoot it right away!
Thank you very much!
(Wait, no!\nIt'll get blocked if I don't aim carefully!)
You're open!
Darn it...
Bossis, you were too slow on that shot.
My bad. I'll get it next time.
(It's the same as before...\nThis time I'll drop it to Napoleon.)
You're up, Napoleon!
(Last you got all up in my face, Jean,\nbut not this time!)
Here we go! Cannon Shot!
How boring!
Wh-Why you! Stay outta my way!
You're usually faster than that, Napoleon.\nWhat's wrong?
Tch... You're next on the chopping block, Pierre.
(The perfect timing is... now!)
Get 'em, Pierre!
Now's my chance! Slider Shot!
(Wha...?!)
Pierre? Didn't expect that.\nWoulda scored if it reached the goal, too.
H-Hey!
Heh. Guess we're all having a bad day.
No, that's not it.
Isn't that right, Jean?
Figures you'd notice, Pierre.
I was trying out a new trick today. Bossis and\nNapoleon are one thing, but I must be onto\nsomething if it worked on Pierre.
Say that again to my face, you stupid...!
Why can't you just acknowledge that Jean played\nbetter today?
Tch! Just wait until we play again.
Jean, I'm glad to have you repping for France.\nI feel relieved knowing that you've got our backs.
Jean,\nFrance will be counting on you from here on out.
Thank you, Pierre. It's an honor.
I'll make sure to work even harder to not let her\ndown.
Hey <avatar_name>? Here to watch us practice?
I can tell you picked up on something from that\nexpression.
Well, you saw right.\nToday, I was purposefully parked at the back.
Do you understand why?
To carefully watch the opponents?
To slack off as much as possible?
Well, sure, that's important, too. If you watch\nyour opponents' movement, you can guess what\nthey'll do next, and prepare for them.
But that's not what I was trying out today.
...
Oh, sorry, I just wasn't sure\nif you were making a joke or insulting me.
If it's the former, sorry for not laughing.\nI guess your sense of humor doesn't match mine.
But if you were serious,\nthen I'll be seriously angry.
But whatever. Back to the point.
Obviously, I had a good reason for\nwhat I was doing.
I knew you could tell by watching, but Bossis and\nNapoleon and even Pierre were a little late on\ntheir shots.
But that's because I made them late.\nBy stopping on the back line.
Against Bossis, with me in front of goal he didn't\nhave a clear shot so he had to stop to aim,\nmissed his timing, and left himself open.
And for Napoleon and Pierre, they were probably\naware of my position and worried about a tackle,\nand that moment of hesitation was all I needed.
That way, even though I'm closer to my opponent,\nI still have time to see where they're aiming,\nand naturally block the shot.
Of course, letting the opponents closer to the\ngoal is always scary, but another way of looking\nat it is they never get a chance to shoot.
Plus, the moment the ball leaves their feet during\na shot is the best chance to steal it. And if\nI can read their aim it's easy enough to block.
Today was just a test, but I'd say it succeeded.
This isn't really a technique so much as a mindset\nthough. And you need skills on my level before\nit'll even work.
As in, the opponent needs to worry about me\nblocking so they'll stop to aim, or about my\ntackles so they hesitate. Even my rep matters.
So if you want to put this into practice,\nfirst you need the skills to back it up.
Well, I'm sure if anyone can pull it off it's you.
I'm looking forward to seeing the fruits of your\nefforts in your next match.
Maybe you'll show me what it is you've been\ndedicating your time to in our match?
Not that it'd work on Pierre,\nno matter how hard you try.
Probably not Napoleon, either.
Hopefully, you'll show some results by finals.\nWin for me, too.
Well, I'm off. The rest is up to you.
Ngh, pretty good Pierre.\nI'll never stop you like this.
You must be getting tired, Jean. It's great\nthat you're so eager to train on your own time,\nbut you need rest, too.
Don't worry, I'm fine. I know my own limits.
Hey, Pierre! The coach is calling for you!
Okay! Coming!
Just don't push yourself. Okay, Jean?
Oh? Who're you?
Oh, right... <avatar_name>? Sorry.
(Maybe Pierre was right. Maybe I'm tired...)
You look like a Japanese player.
You were so close with that tackle.
Can we practice together?
What are you talking about?
That tackle was sloppy as heck.\nPierre wasn't even taking it seriously.
If you thought that was close,\nyou need your eyes checked.
With you?
Thanks, but no thanks.
I have enough on my plate taking care of myself.\nI don't have time to coddle you, too.
Anyway, I've gotta get back to my own practice.\nAnd if you have the time to waste coming here,\nyou'd be better off training more.
You were... <avatar_name>, right?
You played pretty well in your last game.\nGood enough for me to remember you, anyway.
But I never figured you'd be coming back\nto see me after the way I told you off.
You don't let yourself get shaken. I like that.
So to make up for last time,\nhow about we practice together, today?
That said, I play defense. You can practice\ndefense with me as an opponent, or I can teach\nyou some defensive moves. Your choice.
Ooh, your instincts aren't half-bad.\nNot many people can impress me.
Now, I feel even worse for how I treated you.\nI can't believe how much I underestimated\nyour skills. Maybe I need MY eyes checked.
I don't really mind.
Then make up for it by teaching me!
Thanks, that makes me feel better.
That's the plan.\nI don't wanna dwell on this, either.
Still, I'm glad you turned out\nto be the sorta person you are.
I'm an extra member of the French team,\nadded partway through.
As you saw, I can be hard to get along with,\nso when I first joined,\nI was always clashing with the others.
You show up later and you've got\na problem with how I do things?!
Then tell me, was there anything\nwrong with any of my instructions?
Isn't the whole reason they added me to the\nteam BECAUSE you guys have been doing it wrong?\nWhy leave defense to the new guy if you were set?
D-Don't get cocky just because\nPierre thinks you're hot stuff!
Cocky? Me? You think you're better than me\njust because you got picked earlier?
If you ask me, the whole team isn't up to snuff.
You think we're just going to\nsit here and take that?!
Why is everyone fighting?!
L-Listen to this, Pierre! This guy thinks...
Calm down. I'll hear both sides out.
Okay, I think I understand now.
To cut straight to the heart of it, Jean's right.
Wha...?
Based on what I know, Jean's our best defender.
Which is why you should be learning from him.\nListening to him. I thought you'd be improving\nwith him around.
True, Jean can be a little... antagonistic,\nbut he's thinking of the team when he speaks.
So if all of our defenders would focus on\nwhat he says, you could learn a lot.
F-Fine... Understood.
But Jean, there's something\nyou need to work on, too.
What? How am I wrong?!
Even if your ideas are right, no one will listen\nif you say them like you're picking a fight.
How are you supposed to fulfill your role as\nthe leader of the defenders if the other players\nwon't listen to you?
...
Jean, you're a leader, so I want you\nto act like one. Make an effort, at least.
You're right... This was my fault, too.
Sorry, guys.
Nah, we're the ones who let it get to us.
We're all playing for France here. We're a team.\nAnd the more we're aware and proud of that,\nthe better we'll function as a team.
Got that, guys?
Tak!
...
Even though I tell myself not to, I always end up\nsaying the first thing that pops into my head.\nI haven't gotten better at all.
But man, Pierre's amazing.
Either with guys like me and Napoleon here,\nhe manages to pull the whole team together.\nHe's a real leader.
This team would've been done for ages ago\nif he weren't captain.
You really trust him, don't you?
It's really his team, huh?
Trust, huh...? Close, but not quite.
More than just as a player or the captain,\nI really respect him as a human being.
Heh. You're not wrong about that.
But doesn't Japan have its own...
Nah, forget it. Like I said,\nI really have to stop saying this stuff.
Thanks for listening to me ramble on.
How about I teach you the trick\nto my sliding tackle to repay you?
Whoops, look how late it is.\nGuess we can leave it at that.
Let's train together again some time.
Thanks for coming, <avatar_name>.
First of all, 'grats on making it\nto the finals. I'll admit it, we lost.
But you, my friend, have been\nshining ever more brightly.
I can feel the pride in your play. That's probably\nwhy it doesn't feel so bad to lose to you.
Pierre gave me pride in having the opportunity\nto represent the French people, and I can feel\na similar vibe from you.
What does Pierre have to do with this?
You sound like you're Pierre's servant.
That's...
Well, I guess I can tell you.
Well... I can't deny that.
I do my best on this team... for Pierre's sake.
Actually, I quit soccer a little while ago.\nI had some... circumstances.
But Pierre was just so passionate\nabout me playing soccer again.
In other words, I'm only here because of Pierre.\nWell, Napoleon's part of this, too.
Anyway, I sure am glad I was here for this.\nI feel like I was able to experience\njust how amazing soccer is anew.
And that's because I got\nto make wonderful friends like you.
Oh, I know. As proof of our friendship,\nI'll tell you a secret no one else knows.
My real name is Jean-Laurent Pierre.\nAnd that's how I was going to register, too.
But the team already had a Pierre, and didn't\nneed two. And, well, he's the one who deserves\nto be France's Pierre.
So instead, I registered for the\ntournament as Jean.
Kind of a dumb secret, now that I think about it.\nBut I never thought I'd get the chance\nto share it with anyone.
We may have lost to Japan, but with Pierre\nleading us, France is going to get better and\nbetter from here on out.
I'm already looking forward to our next match\nwith you. Just make sure you win in the finals\nand earn that championship title!
Don't you dare lose until we get a\nchance to face you as champions, ourselves.
I saw you in practice the other day, <avatar_name>,\nand it looks like you've completely mastered\nthe defensive strats I taught you.
That's more than enough for when the opponent's\ngot the ball, but I saw a little hesitation when\nyou were up against someone shooting.
There's a problem with the way you block. You'll\njust get blown away if you try to block a strong\nshot the way you have been blocking other shots.
So what should I do?
Nah, I think I'm good.
The solution's simple. Put more\nstrength into it than the ball's carrying,\nso you can neutralize it.
You're a big fish in a small pond.\nSomewhere out there is someone who can take\nshots like you haven't even imagined yet.
And that's the guy we need to be ready for.\nAll you have to do is learn one new skill.\nIs there any reason not to?
Now, I said it was simple, but...\nIt'd probably be faster just to show you.\nOkay, let's take this for a test drive.
Send me a shot with everything you've got,\nand I'll show you how I stop it.
Bring it on!
And that's it.
Put all your strength into stopping the shot,\nat least equal to its strength,\nand you'll cancel out all its momentum.
Now, what're you just standing there for?\nI may not be the best shooter,\nbut you need some practice.
If you're good enough to master my tackle,\nyou're good enough for this. It really depends\non you getting the feel for it though.
Hey, <avatar_name>, when you want to steal the ball\nfrom the opponent, the best way is with a sliding\ntackle, right?
Wrong! There are other ways to do it.
The opponent's feet aren't always touching the\nball when dribbling. That's just facts. So if you\ncan slip into that narrow gap, that's your chance.
Of course, you jump right into their person space\nwhile they're dribbling, they're probably going\nto send you packing. Also facts.
Thus, I thought up a way to make use of the\nopponent's momentum. When I jump in, I go for a\nshoulder charge lowering my center of gravity.
So all of their momentum goes OVER that, and it's\nsurprisingly simple to send someone tumbling.
Actually, I've done judo since I was a kid,\nso I already knew how to use my opponent's\nstrength against him.
What, you think I'm playing dirty?\nYou sweet summer child.
The field is a place where everyone gives it\neverything they've got to survive. And to win.
And if you want to survive, you'd better\nremember this technique. No reason not to.
I'll keep this up 'til I get a clear shot!
Watch out, Napoleon!
Gotcha!
Why you little...! When'd you get there?!
I thought we were pretty far from you!
Hey <avatar_name>. What brings you here today?
That... That play with Napoleon just now?
Oh... Caught your eye? Good instincts.
What happened there is that when my opponent... I\nmean when Napoleon last saw me, I was running\nnormally. I made him think that's my speed.
But as soon as he looked away, I dashed like\na madman and approached from his blind spot.\nThat's why he was so surprised.
The trick is the unexpected timing and angle\nof approach. It's my favorite defensive tactic.
It sounds easy when described,\nbut how easy do you think it is to actually do?\nHint for ya... it's not.
But if you can master it, you'll be\nthe boogeyman of any offensive formation.
Competing in athletics or technique is fine,\nbut it's tactics like this that really get me\nenergized. Try it out some time.

There's more where that came from!
Can any keeper stop me?
Are you watching, world?
We're back in it! It's our game now!
Don't let up! Crush 'em!
There we go! Now, we ride this wave!
No worries! We'll get the lead again!
Don't worry about the points. Attack!
I'm here. I won't let us be beat!
Leuk! Great play!
Nice one!

Excellent pass!
Okay!

Here comes a serious Stinger Shot!
Stinger Shot coming through!
Take this! Stinger Shot!
You think you can follow this one?
This is it!
Too easy!
Learn to lose, Tsubasa!
There won't be a next time, Tsubasa!
Heh, you sure overhype that Tiger talk.
Urgh! So, this is the Wild Tiger, Hyuga?
Is that all you've got, Misaki?
Ack, where did that come from, Misaki?
You did put up a fight, Matsuyama!
The power of hard work, eh, Matsuyama?
Don't get ahead of yourself, Misugi!
Misugi... Try to make this fun!
Now who's number one, Schneider?
I won't stay down, Schneider!
Should've played for real, Heine!
I can't believe this clown could... Ugh!
Looks like I'm just better, Pierre!

Not to the likes of you, Napoleon!
You haven't won yet, Napoleon!
Too bad, Jean! You had good insight!
Got some good eyes on you, Jean!
I've got you downloaded, Klismann!
Ack, you've improved, Klismann!
You have to change it up, Kaiser!
Fast as ever, Kaiser!
You're not ready for me yet, Lensen!
Agh, such calculated play!
Dirk, you can't keep playing like that!
Did Dirk just outplay me?
You're an open book, Rusciano!
I'll get you next time, Rusciano!
Meh. You disappoint me, Carlos!
You don't make this easy, do you?
And they call you a prodigy? Ridiculous!
So, this is Juan Diaz, the prodigy!
Victorino, you've got spirit but...
Victorino, you are LIGHTNING!
Polished technique but still lacking!
Well, well... You've got some moves!
I'm not like other players, Ryan!
Hah, that was entertaining!
Don't you have anything but strength?
Hey, Blake, how are you so strong?!
I repay all my debts!
I won't stop until I'm the world's best!
Don't besmirch my name!
I don't lose. Period!
Victory is ours for the taking!
Thanks for joining me again, <avatar_name>.
It's not every day you can watch the Dutch\npractice up close. I want to soak in as much\nas I can.
Thanks for joining me today, <avatar_name>.
I always wanted to check out the Netherlands'\npractices, but it felt awkward coming alone.\nI know it's silly.
So, let's really absorb what we can today.
Heads up, Kluivoort!
The goal area's my territory!\nGet ready to be shut down!
Heh. Don't forget I shine here, too!
Dang it!
Got it!
Wow...!
Did you see that? The way he moved\nand broke through all on his own?
His maneuvering and technique were perfect.\nEspecially, the way he entered the attacking third\nand set up that strong shot off a dribble.
He not only cut past the other player, but\nactually took it all the way to the goal. When\nhe takes off, you can't take your eyes off him.
He never disappoints.
Oh, hey, <avatar_name>, right?\nWe're already done with practice today, you know.
Huh? You wanted to ask about Kluivoort?
Well, you've seen him. The guy's top notch in\npractically every area. But when it comes to\noffense, he's a cut above the rest.
His technique beats mine. He breaks through\nbetter than Kaiser.\nAnd his shots are stronger than Lensen's.
He catches every opening, and he can go into\nhigh gear at the drop of a hat.
And to top it all off, when he gets near the goal,\nhe performs in a way that is jaw-dropping.
In the Netherlands's Junior Youth League,\nthey say it's "showtime" whenever he does that.
Pretty fitting, right?
Oh? Aren't you Japan's number 23, <avatar_name>?
Come to think of it, you've been training with\nKluivoort a lot lately.
So, what brings you here today?
Oh... You wanted to hear about Kluivoort's\nplay style, eh?
Well, I'm sure you have an idea, having played\nagainst him. His plays are all top-level, and\nwhen it comes to offense, there's no one finer.
Technique, breakthrough skills, powerful shots,\nthe kid's got it all.
His eye for strategy lets him exploit every\nopening, and his technique allows him to dive in\nat the critical moment.
Then, when he gets in close to the goal and shifts\ninto high gear? He's above and beyond almost any\nother player I've worked with.
In the Netherlands Junior Youth League,\nwe call the times he does that "showtime."\nQuite fitting, if you ask me.
I've been coaching soccer for a long time,\nso I've seen a lot of players come and go.
Ones who really captivate you when you see them\nplay the way he does...\nthere aren't a lot of players like that.
It seems like his plays have bewitched you, too.\nOf course, I understand why.
Hey, <avatar_name>. Did you want to see me?
Could I study your moves?
Let me show you my "showtime."
Now? Well... I was thinking of calling it a day,\nbut sure, why not?
I'll humor you for a bit.\nYou came all the way here, after all.
Ha! Will you now?
I don't know who you heard that from, but I admire\nyour moxie, taking me on by yourself.
I like that. Let's see this showtime of yours!
(That <avatar_name> is trying to rip off\nKluivoort's timing and technique.)
(Still, Kluivoort looks like\nhe's really enjoying it.)
(We never did manage to get past Hernandez\nin our match with Italy.\nWe just relied on Kluivoort the whole time.)
(Granted, he's not the kind of player to be\nresentful of the responsibility.)
(We have to follow <avatar_name>'s lead\nand try harder to get as good as he is!)
(It looks like he's trying to learn\nKluivoort's timing and technique.\nThe boy's drive is admirable, I hafta admit.)
(With players like that,\nJapan's only going to keep getting stronger.)
What's this?\nDid you also come to see Kluivoort's plays?
That's right.
In that match with Italy, we never managed to get\npast Hernandez.\nWe just relied on Kluivoort right to the end.
We can't let that happen anymore.\nWe need to catch up to him as much as possible.
Is that so?
(We Dutch players have a desire to improve that\nno one in the world can beat.)
(We're going to dominate the Youth Championship\nand whatever comes next.)
(And we'll do it with the strength of Netherlands'\nsoccer: The Ultimate Formation!)
Okay, practice is over! But once we get back,\nwe'll be having a meeting to reflect on what\nhappened today.
Got it!
Hmm? Who're you?
Based on that jersey, I'm guessing\nyou're a Japanese player?
Oh... right. Japan's number 23?
I'd love to see more of your play...
Umm, I've been meaning to talk to you...
You want to use me for reference?
Copying me won't be easy,\nbut that's a great attitude.
You came all this way just to see me?
But sorry, I don't have time to talk right now.
Well, you've definitely got courage, if you came\nhere to speak privately with the opposing team\ncaptain before a match. I like that.
So did you come here because you\nrecognized me as a worthy opponent?
Hey! Kluivoort! We can't start\nthe meeting without you!
Oops, sounds like everyone's\nwaiting for me. Excuse me.
Oh... You're back.
Frankly, I'm surprised you came,\nafter how I treated you.
(Is he that serious about\nlearning a move from me?)
Heh. You've got pluck. I like it.\nFine, let's practice together for a bit.
Phew... You got some moves.
But in the end you're still just copying\nmy form. You've got a long ways to go\nbefore you make my tricks your own.
What I just showed you should be more than\nenough to go on. Show me you can figure out\nthe rest on your own.
It doesn't have to be perfect, but you were\nchosen to represent a whole country, too,\nweren't you? There's no way you can't do it.
If you're not at the point where you're the only\none who comes to mind when anyone says "Japan's\nnumber 23," then you're not working hard enough.
Come to think of it, are any of\nthe Japanese reps at that level yet?
Number 10, Captain Tsubasa, maybe?
Misugi is hands down number 14...
Of course. The heart of the team, right?
Oh, really?
(I guess this obsession with\nnumbers is the same everywhere.)
(Tsubasa, huh? Number 10 certainly\nsuits a captain like him.)
(Misugi... I'll never forget seeing him play.)
(There's no way I'm losing to another number 14!)
(No way... The same number as me?)
(I doubt it means anything, but if it does...\nI can't stop thinking about it.)
Sorry to interrupt, Kluivoort,\nbut can you give us a hand?
Seems like Kaiser's just not\ngetting the pattern of our pass chain.
Oh, I suppose I must. I'll be right over.
As you can see, they keep me pretty busy around\nhere. Stop by again when you have the chance.
Oh, hey <avatar_name>.
Right. I need to see how far\nyou've come with mastering my move.
I knew it...
I knew it...
Looks like you've really\nimproved a lot over this tournament.
You've really made that move your own,\nand become a world-class player. I'm impressed.
And then there's me. The guy who slammed\nheadfirst into his own arrogance, and couldn't\neven make it past the preliminaries.
No, you were a tough opponent.
You're right. You need more practice.
Heh. Never thought I'd be trying to fish up\ncompliments from an opponent after a loss.
But it doesn't change the fact\nthat I let down a lot of people.
Heh. Cocky, aren't we?
But as much as it hurts to hear it, you're right.\nMy pride got in the way, and I let down a lot of\npeople.
The number on my back, number 14, used to belong\nto one of the greatest Dutch players of all time.
I admire him, but the moment I took on his number\nI also took on all the expectations that came\nwith it.
Everyone expected me to do great things, and\nlead the Netherlands to victory in the World Cup.
I've always thought that this number\nwon't REALLY be mine until that moment.
And here I am. I'm pathetic, aren't I?\nI really do need to rebuild myself.
Heh. Maybe I've said a bit too much.
Kluivoort! It's about time to group up!
We're training with a new pass chain tonight!\nHurry up, I wanna try this out!
C'mon, let's go.\nEveryone's waiting for you, Captain.
Yeah... Sure thing.
<avatar_name>. By the time we have our next\nmatch, we'll be a whole new Netherlands.
And this time, we'll win. Make sure you're ready.
Anyway, good luck in your next match!
I mean, even if you make fools of yourselves\nout there, it'll just make us look even worse\nfor losing to you!
So don't. Win. Promise me.
I've seen you do a lot of good\nwork during this tournament so far.
But from my perspective, your plays are\nstill a little lacking in breadth.
It's a waste of your talent if you ask me.\nFor starters, why don't you try locking in some\nfeints?
This one was popularized by one of the\nNetherland greats, but I put my own spin on\nit and now it's one of my specialties.
Watch closely, I'm going to show you how\nit's done. And then you can practice it.
The trick is to...
No, what are you doing?! That won't work as a\nfeint at all. It has to look real enough to fool\nthe opponent.
Yeah, that's more like it!\nYou're getting the form down!
All that's left is to add this feint to your\nrepertoire, and be able to pull it off just\nlike that.
That's all the advice I can give.\nYou'll just have to get used to it yourself.
(But you've come so far in such a short time...\nNot bad at all, <avatar_name>.)
Hey, you came <avatar_name>.
Sorry, but we're doing team practice after this.\nI don't have time to practice with you.
Oh, I know. Our practice is open to the public,\nso you can come watch if you like.
Who knows, you might even learn something?
Okay, shift to offense as soon\nas you steal the ball!
Yes, Coach!
Let's do this, Kaiser!
You know it!
Kaiser! Don't move up on your own! If you lose\nthe ball you're giving the opponent a chance!\nWork together with the team to keep it secure!
Kaiser! Pass it to Klissman!
That's it, Kluivoort! Keep it up! You're in\ncharge of giving directions on the field!\nGo with your gut!
Yes, Coach!
The other team can't attack when\nyou're on offense! Focus on offense!
Offense and defense are connected! Connect\nyour passes so the opponent can't touch you!
Now! Over here, Klismann!
You got this, Kluivoort!
Alright! Got it!
Great offense, guys! Just keep connecting\npasses and toying with the defense, and you'll\nfind your chance to shoot eventually.
Kluivoort. Our entire offense depends on you.\nWe'll be counting on you in our matches.
Yes, Sir! Leave it to me!
So the best defense is a good offense.
That style'll take the world by storm.
Hey, <avatar_name>. It's about time\nto start practice! Get back here!
Hey, <avatar_name>, where are you? Practice is\nabout to start without you! Get back here!
Can I ask you something?\nHow do you feel when you're taking a shot?
Like I'll definitely make it.
Nothing in particular.
I see. That feeling is important.
I see. That does sound like something you'd say.
But while maybe that's okay for now,\nin the future it'd probably be better to\nconsciously aim a little higher.
But practically speaking, you're\nnever going to make all your shots.
That's because there's a goalie.
So that's why I also try to focus on making\nit harder for the goalie to catch, so you can\nthrow them off balance.
If they have to deflect it, you get another\nchance to shoot. And if they're off balance,\nthe follow-up shot is easier to score on.
Luckily for me, both the Netherlands team and my\nown club back home are blessed with a talented\noffensive lineup.
And as both a striker and an ace, it's my\njob to make those opportunities for everyone.
From what I can tell, Japan's put\ntogether a great offense, too.
So if you can keep that in mind while making your\nshots, you might be able to help your team score\na little more.
Like I said earlier, I think a striker or ace's\njob isn't just to score points, it's to help\ntheir team win however they can.
I can tell from how you've played recently\nthat you've been taking those words to heart.
Though... While I can't tell if it's kindness\nor timidity, I feel like you still aren't able\nto follow through.
It just feels like your holding back when\nyou know you're going to hit the goalie,\nor when you're taking a point blank shot.
It feels wrong to hit him full on.
I don't mean to...
I see. Of course.\nCan't say I don't know the feeling.
I see. So it's unconscious then.
But sometimes you have to be fierce\nif you want to help your team win.
There's no room for mercy on the pitch.\nYou have to be prepared to break a\ngoalie's hand to get a goal.
If you hesitate at some critical moment because\nyou're worried about a keeper, that could cost\nyour team the win. And it'd be your fault.
I'm not saying you always have to be mean,\nbut in a real game, that's how much conviction\nyou should be putting behind the ball.
You're already someone your teammates rely on.
Consider it advice from a guy who thinks\nyou'd make a great rival. Just keep it in mind.
You know, I've always thought you were an\ninteresting guy for boldly coming here to learn\nmy moves, but I never thought you'd come so far.
You've really made my moves your own.
With your talent, I'm sure you\ncan even master my trump card.
The difficulty of this shot\nmakes the Stinger look like a joke.
You have to coil your whole body like a spring\nand twist your foot to deliver an impact that\ngoes right through to the core of the ball.
Screw up any part of it and the result\nwon't even be able to be called a shot.
So here's the trick. Unlike the Stinger...
And that's the long and short of it.
To put it together, you'll have to try it out and\nget the feel for it yourself. I can't give any\nmore advice, just practice it until it works.
But you're quite the guy.\nI'm looking forward to our next match.

Score!
This is what you're up against!
We did that as a team!
None too shabby, eh?
Time to settle accounts!
Rack up the points!
See? We can take this yet!
Now, we score again.
Careful not to overextend!
Breathe, guys. We've got more to go!
That's how we play!
Splendid!
Good stuff!
Not that!
What is happening?!
S-Stop them!
Don't see a pass like that everyday!
Thanks!
I'll take it from here!
Here I go!
Hey!
Here!
To me!
Pass!
Comin' through!
Missed me!
Nice try!
My win, Tsubasa!
Argh! Tsubasa's got the jukes!
A Tiger can be trapped!
Urgh, I misjudged the Fierce Tiger!
My technique wins out, Misaki!
Well, I'll be! Fair play, Misaki!
You can't catch me, Matsuyama!
Dang, that persistence pays off, huh?
Why so dull, Misugi?! What gives?
Wow, Misugi! What a play!
You still have a lot to learn, Izawa!
Those moves were slick, Izawa!
You're outmatched, Schneider!
Is the Young Emperor bit just for show?
That's for messing around, Heine!
Ugh, losing to that Heine guy...
Who won the battle of technique, Pierre?
Pierre! Your moves are art in motion!
You're just thrashing about, Napoleon!
You're getting on my nerves!
I've got you beat, Jean!
Whoa, smooth moves, Jean!
Aren't you better than that, Kluivoort?!
Ugh, you really drive hard, Kluivoort!
You're a one-trick pony, Kaiser!
You speed demon!
My technique is unbeatable, Lensen!
Your decision-making's on point!
You won't beat me like that, Dirk!
Urgh, you've really improved, Dirk!
Did you think you'd beat me, Rusciano?
Curse you, Rusciano! Making me look bad!
Is this how you play, Carlos?
Kinda impressive.
I guess I was better this time, Diaz!
Okay, you can call yourself a genius!
I will not be outdone!
Ack, can't deny that technique, Senghor!
Are you kidding me, Ryan?
When did Ryan get this good?
You'll need more than power to beat me!
Argh, he's just too strong!
Just leave the attack strategy to me!
Hey everyone, stay positive, okay?
There's no "I" in team, fellas!
Hmm? Is someone calling for me?
Over there?
Umm... You're...?
I'd guess from your get-up\nthat you play for Japan?
Umm... You're...?
Oh, I remember now. Japan's number 23.\n<avatar_name>, I think?
I hate to say this after you came all this way,\nbut I don't have any time to spare right now.
So sorry, but I've got to get going.
Then, I'll try again later.
You're really that busy?
Sure, got it.
Hey, I have plenty of things I want to do.\nNeed to do. And stuff to think about.
Obviously there's our strategy and my own skills,\nbut for a lotta the reps this is the first time\nwe've been played together, too.
I want to work on our communication and\ntry to buck up everyone's spirits a bit.
Besides...
Hey, Klismann! Can you spare a minute?\nDirk and Dolman just starting arguing!
And dealing with this sort of thing.
So anyway, we can talk more when I have time.\nBye.
Hey, <avatar_name>! Sorry about last time.
As an apology, how about you tag along with me\nfor practice today? Should be pretty educational\nto see another country's play style up close.
Oof, not bad.
I never thought someone younger than me would\nbe so skilled. Makes sense that you're a rep.
Naturally.
I'm still not sure why I was chosen.
Haha. Just make sure not to slack off,\nso all that self-confidence doesn't go to waste.
Be more confident.\nI can't stand a loser attitude.
That reminds me. I heard your team is actually\nmade up of players taken from different schools?
That's like the opposite of\nhow the Netherlands does it.
Almost all of us come from\nthe same club back home.
That's Kluivoort, me, Kaiser,\nLensenblink, Dirk, Dolman...
We're all the cream of the crop for the country.\nThe team was assembled by a famous talent scout.
This way we're all already used to each other\nand our quirks, which smooths out our teamwork.
Compared to us, your team sounds like a real\npain. Wouldn't you have to start everything\nfrom scratch?
Well, I guess it's not like it's\nall smooth sailing on our end either.
Anyway, let's both do our best to\ngive our teams the best chance to win.
Oh hey, it's you.
Looks like both you and\nyour team are doing pretty well.
It's just one tough match after another.
We won't stop until we're champions!
What'd you expect from a tournament like this?\nWe're all the best of the best here.
Heh. After going up against you...\nI can believe it.
To be honest, before our match\nI thought Japan would be an easy win.\nBut you're an incredible team.
Your team hasn't existed for long, right?\nIt was put together for this tournament.
But despite that, you have such amazing\nteamwork and trust in each other. I can tell.
You must have a great coach or\ncaptain pulling everyone together.
Not that we don't have an amazing captain\nof our own. Kluivoort is something else.
Even now, we're practicing a new\nstrategy with him at the center.
We've learned from our loss to you, and\nwe'll definitely be better for it next time.
I can't wait for the day we get to\nplay you and the All-Japan team again.
(<avatar_name>... Japan... I know I've\nnot seen everything they have to show yet.)
(Heh. Looks like we're rivals.)







Oh, yeah!
Grawh!
Here it is!
Now!
Take this!
Here we go!
Hoera!

Hoera! I love this feeling!
Tak! Smashed that goal!
Nailed it!
In case you wondered how it's done!
This is how you get goals!
G to the O to the A to the L!
The rest is all us!
Heh, you haven't seen anything yet!
We're on a roll now!
Chill! We just get the point back!
The best defense is a good offense! Go!
What do we do? Attack, attack, ATTACK!
That was resplendent!
Attaboy!
Good stuff!
Oof!
No way!
Trip 'em up!
A perfect pass!
Hup!
I got it!
Here we go!
Open!
Here!
Me, me, me!
Pass!
Back off!
Too slow!
Woohoo!
Heh, can't keep up, Tsubasa?
No! It didn't work on Tsubasa...
Were you a cheetah, I'd be worried!
Guess kitty's got claws!
You move well, but slow, Misaki!
Whoa, some real technique there!
More energy, Matsuyama! More!
Phew, you've got guts, Matsuyama!
Gotta sharpen up those moves, Misugi!
You saw right through me, huh, Misugi?
You have to really go for it, Taki!
Wow, Taki, you've gotten good!
You're not faster than me, Schneider!
Tch, classic Schneider!
You're not your usual self, Heine!
Hey! You weren't supposed to out do me!
You don't wanna race me, Pierre!
You sure have some fine moves, Pierre!
Think you're better than me, Napoleon?
So violent!
My speed wins again, Jean!
Argh, nice breakthrough, Jean!
What's the deal, Kluivoort?
That was as Kluivoort as it gets!
Booyah! Snail's pace, Klismann!
I guess I'll need more than speed now!
Lensen! You know I'm the fastest, right?
Urgh, I won't lose again, Lensen!
I'm running circles around you, Dirk!
What...? I lost to... Dirk?!
My speed tops yours, Rusciano!
You kinda give me the creeps, Rusciano!
Were you surprised by my energy, Carlos?
Ugh, Carlos! Nothing worked!
He may be a genius, but with my speed...
Argh, how is he so good?!
Soccer's all about spirit, Senghor!
Wow, Senghor! You saw through my strat!
Woohoo! In your face, Ryan!
Could you tell where I was going?!
You need more than playing rough, Blake!
Ugh, he sure can power right on through!
Okay, everyone, let's go wild out there!
Woohoo! Time for some fun!
I'm the Netherlands's point-maker!
Hey! You there! Could you get that ball for us?
Thanks! I owe ya one!
Hey... Your uniform...\nAre you on the Japanese team?
Thanks! I owe ya one!
Oh... Weren't you on the Japanese team?
Don't tell me you got lost on the island?\nNah, couldn't be.
What are you doing, Kaiser? Hurry up over there!
On it!
Kaiser!
Please wait!
Hmm? Need something?
Hmm? Need something?
That's enough messing around, Kaiser!\nGet back over here!
Sorry, but we're in the middle of team practice.\nIf I don't get back, Coach'll have my hide.
Now that we're introduced...\nLet's meet up again when we get the chance!
Yo! Hard at work, huh?
Hey, are you free?
We were gonna go play some soccer\non the beach. Wanna come?
Is this practice for the Japan team?
Let me show you what I can do!
Ha! Worried about before?
It's fine. Today's our day off. It's just for fun.
C'mon, let's go!
Ha! That's the spirit!\nBut I'm not gonna back down, either.
For today, how about we just forget about\nbeing rivals and all that and just have some fun?
Man, I'm not use to playing on sand,\nbut it's weirdly fun, isn't it?
I've always felt that the real joy of soccer\nwas everyone just chasing the ball like this.
Like, we're supposed to be rivals, but here were\nare laughing together. What's better than soccer?
I suppose that's enough for now. We can't go\nexhausting ourselves with real practice tomorrow.
Let's do this again some time!
<avatar_name>! Pass it here!
Alright! It's in!
Yahoo! That was awesome! I'm having more fun\nwith you here than I usually do with my team!
Now let's do it one more time!\nI wanna try that combo again!
Man, that was fun! Always wish I could\nspend more time just kickin' the ball around.
But... I think there comes a time when\nyou can't just play for fun anymore...
What do you mean?
What's wrong with playing for fun?
I got this far just running as hard as I could,\nand if we scored a sweet goal, all the better.
But that's not enough to be the best in the world.\nI realized that when I saw Japan lose to Italy.
I used to think it would be enough. But you\ncan't rise to the top of the world that way.
I realized that after I saw Japan lose to Italy.
In order for the Netherlands to become the best,\nwe need to start playing in a new way.
We can't rely on skill alone, we'll have to\nplay smarter too, and drill these complex\nstrategies until they're second nature.
To be honest, I'm not exactly a strategic prodigy.\nBut it's no use saying that.
I decided that if we really want this,\nthen I'll have to change.
Hey! I see that look on your face.\nYou're thinking "that's not the\nKaiser I know," aren't you?
Next time we play each other,\nI'll make you rethink that!
We're going to become stronger,\nand we're definitely going to win against you!\nI hope you're ready when the time comes!







Ha!
Rah!
There!
Gotcha!
Right there!
Push up!
Close in!























Captain!
I leave it to you!
Looking to you!
Incoming!
Here it goes!
Let's take it to 'em!
Zróbmy to!

Naturally.
Killed it!
Heh, see that?
No biggie.
Next, we take the lead. Easy peasy!
Then, we get another goal, and another!
That's it! Focus on catching up!
Don't worry! They just caught up a bit.
Quit being skittish. We have to focus!
Calm down! Rushing won't do us any good!
Good one!
Perfect!
Keep it up!
Oh boy...!
Wha...?!
If we don't stop them...
Great pass!
Alright.
Leave it to me!
Here I go!
This way!
Here!
Ball!
Pass!
Don't mind me!
Hmph!
Comin' through!
Is that all you've got, Tsubasa?
Tsubasa... figures.
So, Tiger's just a nickname, huh?
The nickname suits you, Hyuga!
I win this one, Misaki!
Man, you're good, Misaki!
You can't win, Matsuyama!
Wow, you showed me!
This isn't like you, Misugi.
You're the man, Misugi!
I told you to cool your jets, Kisugi!
Well, good calls out there.
Really, Schneider? Is that it?
This is the Young Emperor's power, huh?
Quit messin' around, Heine!
Ugh, he's actually talented.
Is this all you had to offer, Pierre?
Those moves... Now, I get it.
You try too hard to be rough, Napoleon!
I can't stand how you play, Napoleon!
That's not all, is it, Jean?
You've got some choice moves, Jean!
You got careless, Kluivoort!
Urgh, that's the Kluivoort I expected.
Don't take me lightly, Klismann!
Ugh, you did me in, Klismann!
Relax a little, Kaiser.
Tch, didn't think I'd lose to you.
I wouldn't lose to you, Dirk!
Okay, Dirk, ya got me.
You call that skill, Rusciano?
Rusciano... Not a fan of that guy.
Don't look down on me, Carlos!
There are those Carlos moves!
Little disappointed here, Diaz.
So, this is Juan Diaz?
Guess I came out on top, eh, Senghor?
You've got skills, Senghor!
Did you misjudge me, Ryan?
Leave it to Ryan to read my every move.
Your brute-force approach was lacking.
Ugh, you're a powerhouse alright!
Just stay cool and aim for the goal.
If you rush, you sabotage yourself.
Hmph. Now you see what I'm capable of!
What are you doing, Lensen?\nPractice is about to start.
Ah, I'll be there as soon as I fix up my cleats.\nSomething's been bugging me.
Gotcha. Then I'll head on over first.
Huh? Who are you?\nI'd guess by your kit you play for Japan.
Huh? Who are you?
You're face looks familiar.\nDo you play for Japan?
I've been watching you play for while!
I wanted to talk a little.
You've seen me?
Well, I hope it was helpful for you.
Talk to me?
I'm sorry, but talking really isn't my thing.\nIf you got what it takes, it'll come out.
By the by, your shoes are a little loose.\nYou need to be careful.\nThat's a great way to get yourself hurt.
Anyways, practice is getting started.\nI got to get going.
I hope to see you again.
Racja! Penalty kick practice! I'm up first!
Alright! Take a break and hit the bench.
Ah, you're... <avatar_name>?
Everyone breakup and practice on your own.\nHuh? You want something from me?
Well, you keep comin' back. It'd be a\nshame to send ya home empty-handed again.\nLet's get some practice in.
Let's work on penalty kicks!\nMaybe I can give you some advice!
Ready? First, the keeper needs a strong center of\ngravity and line of site. They calmly observe\nmovements and know when and where to jump.
Then, they check the kicker's foot angle\nand stride. They take in his speed and course.
They have to see the future!
You can recognize that much?
Yeah, sorta...\nThough of course, I can't be 100% certain.
Naturally, there are limits,\nand nothing's 100% sure, but...
I CAN use my movements to\nguide my opponent's actions.
That's probably the most\nadvanced tactic of soccer.
How long are you gonna keep yappin'!\nYou play soccer with your body, not your mouth!
Or so I've been told.
Hey <avatar_name>! Get over here!\nI got something to show you!
Man... Not bad at all.\nThis has been a good practice.
That was great! Come back anytime!
I haven't seen you that pumped up\nover practice for a long time!
Soccer's more fun when your\nopponents are a bit of a challenge.
Things are more interesting when the bar is set\nhigher. I want Japan to be good enough to give\nus a real challenge.
Tak! For sure!
It doesn't matter. We'll be the ones\nto come out on top in the end, right?
Well, yeah, duh!
Hey <avatar_name>. Sorry about practice!
I was able to check out the game.\nIt looks like Japan is in good shape.
To tell the truth, I didn't expect you guys\nto go so far. You were a real dark horse.
It looks like you might give us a fight after all.
We may have been holding back a little.\nI'm sorry. We should have brought our best.
We have a new vision for our team. All that's\nleft is to work together to make it happen.
For the rest of this tourney, you'll hear\nus cheerin' ya from the stands, though.
Huh...? You got a strange look on your face.
You're supporting us?
You're actually not bad at conversation!
The better team won. This time it was you.
We all want to thank you for\nreminding us what mattered.
Eh? I've never considered\nmyself the silent type, but...
Lots of folks seem to think\nthat I am for whatever reason.
Anyways, I'm heading back to the dorms soon.
And let's both keep giving it our all...\nUntil the next time we can do battle!
And next time, my team's winnin'.

Tak! We'll score as much as it takes!
Let's take this game back!
Darn it! Not one more step back!
Tch, that's as far as you go!
This ain't over yet!
Hell yeah! Good one!
Awesome!
Whoa, nice!
That's bad!
Huh?!
Stop them!
That's a good pass!
Kay!
I'm on it!
Go time!
Yippee ki yay!
Let me have it!
Come on! I'm right here!
Pass, now!
Wryah!
I'm gonna send you flyin'!
Here me roar!
Hehe, that all you got, Tsubasa?
Oof! You go hard, don't you?
Some tiger you are, Hyuga!
I did not wanna lose to you!
Didn't know you were so dainty, Misaki!
Ugh, your skills are frustrating.
You've got nothin' on me, Matsuyama!
Ugh, not bad for Matsuyama!
Gettin' sluggish there, Misugi!
Jeez! You're the real deal, Misugi!
You think I'd lose to this pip-squeak?
I just lost to this lil dude?
Hah, Emperor of what?
Argh, so this is Schneider?
Where's your magic now, Magician?
This is the Magician of Dresden?!
Stop acting so cool, Pierre!
Ugh. Is this Pierre's true skill?
I thought you liked it rough, Napoleon!
Man! You can really play, huh?
Heh, not much to you, is there, Jean?
Okay, okay, so you've got a move or two.
Hehe, have you lost your Kluivoort-ness?
This is what Kluivoort is capable of?
Heh, you asked for it, Klismann!
Give me a break, Klismann!
Oi oi! Step up your game, Kaiser!
Ugh, you're too darn fast Kaiser!
You need more oomph, Lensen!
Ugh, how do people play against you?
Victorino! Victory is mine!
Don't mock me, Rusciano!
So much for Brazil's ace!
Man, Carlos, you really are good!
The prodigy isn't that big a deal, huh?
Gah... So this is Diaz.
You really are just a twerp, Senghor!
Ugh. Well, aren't you skilled, Senghor?!
Hehe, go back to your mom, kid!
The hell? How'd this kid...?
Why so delicate, Blake?!
Agh! This is not happening again!
Hah, quit acting like a brat!
This isn't the kiddie leagues!
Who're you? This is the Netherlands' locker room.
What's up <avatar_name>?\nSomething going on today?
Oh? You want to meet Dirk?
Well, practice is probably over for today.
If I know Dirk, he's around her somewhere.
Man... Coach said I still need to hustle more...\nI was killing myself out there running.
Huh? Who the heck are you?\nThis is the Netherlands' pitch.
Well... Your jersey says you play for Japan...
Y'know, I've seen your face before.
Got it! All-Japan number 23!
What do you want?
I wanted to play some soccer with Dirk.
Please, faceoff with me!
You want to play soccer with me?
That's... sudden.
Alright. I'll give you a quick game.
You think you're good enough to play against me?\nDon't make me laugh!\nGet good first, and then come back!
Dirk, don't you think you\nwere a little rough on the kid?
...
You shouldn't take your frustrations\nfrom practice out on other people.
I'm sorry, Kluivoort.\nI'll watch myself next time.
Hey, <avatar_name>. I came to apologize.
I was angry at something our coach said during\npractice that day. And I took it out on you.
Sorry. That's on me.
As an apology, how about we take\nsome time and practice together today?
Oh, man... I'm winded. Let's take a break.
(Well, well... The kid is better than I thought)
Looks like you've been practicing your shooting\nand dribbling. You've got solid offensive and\ndefensive skills.
And not just in practice today. When we played\nagainst each other I was impressed then, too.
Have you ever thought about\nplaying a different position?
To be honest, I have.
I've never really thought about it.
I knew it. I have as well.
Ah, that's too bad. But I can understand that.
I play defense but I think I'd be good on\noffense. I mean I have confidence that the power\nin my shots alone would make us unbeatable.
At the same time, I'm proud of the defensive\nlineup we've built in the Netherlands.
Thanks to me, the team can focus on\nattacking without worrying about defense.
Ha! Good thing Kluivoort's not here to hear me\nsay that. He'd say "confidence and arrogance\nare not the same thing."
Anyways, let's talk again soon!
Hey, <avatar_name>!
Good timing! Want to get in some practice?
Did I tell you how much I hate you?
Ha ha! You're even better than before!\nI knew you had potential!
Ha ha! You were really good in that last match\nwe played, and you've gotten way better since\nwe met!
You're definitely one to watch!
If you keep quiet and your nose to the\ngrindstone, your whole team will be bolstered\nby your strength.
You mean like Kluivoort?
You mean like you?
Well, Kluivoort is a different case. Do you\nthink you can inspire your team with words alone?
That kind of confidence is a mystery. It inspires\nthe entire team to win. Maybe it's charisma.
Thanks kid. Nice of you to say.
Anyways, you're joking, right?
I appreciate the vote of confidence,\nbut it's Kluivoort who drives our team.
You won't find anyone who disagrees.\nNot on this team!
Kluivoort is the soul of this team.\nWe didn't win the tournament this time,\nbut we're only going to get better.
We're already looking toward\nrevitalizing the team. Things're busy.
With my skills and physique as I am, I'm not at\npeak performance. I can't handle new tactics.
Even though I don't get as much attention as\noffense does, I'm proud to play a central role\nfor the Netherlands.
And while you may have shaken my confidence a\nlittle in this tournament, wait until you see\nthe team next time around!
We'll have a blast!
So don't lose until you lose to us. Got it?
Okay, so the trick of my tackles is to slide\nall my weight and momentum toward the front of\ntheir feet.
With your physique, I'm sure you\nhave the power to pull it off.
You're smaller than me, but if you put 100% of\nyour momentum and weight into it you should be\nquite powerful.
Its easy to practice.
I'll step on the ball and\nput all my weight on it.
It won't be easy but try to knock it loose!
Racja! Send me flying!
Alright! Let's try another one!
Urgh!
Nicely done <avatar_name>!\nDon't forget how to throw your weight around!
(This guy is really good.\nBut I'm still not gonna lose!)

Score! The goalie scored!
I planted that one in there!
I showed them!
How's this?!
Leave defending to me. You just score!
I won't even let a moth into the goal!
They're done scoring! Go get some goals!
Ack! Sorry...
They shall not pass!
I'm begging you, just score!
Now that was a good play!
Good stuff!
Look at you!
I got a bad feeling...!
What's happening?!
Don't let them through!
Good pass!
Got it!
Leave it to me!
I'm up!
I'm open!
Over to me!
Hey, here!
Pass!
Thanks for the warm-up, Tsubasa!
Hehe, you yell better than you shoot!
So much for your French trick!
Hehe, too bad!
Hehe. Totally uncool.
Those acrobatics won't work on me!
My grandma shoots better!
Anyone can learn to curve their shots!
That's some power you got, Schneider.
I'm tired of all this artisan talk!
Heine, your shots are kind of... meh.
Was that really a Pierre shot?
Hehe, your shots don't match your hype.
Having an off day, Kluivoort?
I can stop your shots, no problem!
You disgrace the point-taker title!
Is that all you got, Lensen?!
Kick a little harder, Dirk!
Hehe, you talk big for how you shoot!
Was that it, Carlos?
And they call you the pride of Brazil?!
Hehe, is this how a prodigy shoots?
Is this what your spirit amounts to?
Harder, man. Harder!
Diallo, did you think that would go in?
You shoot like a little kid!
Hehe, I don't go down that easily!
Hehe, sucks for you! I'm still here!
Ack! You got me!
Who are you?\nThis is the Netherlands' locker room.
Hey, if it isn't <avatar_name>! What is it?
Oh, you wanted to meet Dolman?
Our meeting will begin soon so we\ndon't have a lot of time. Mind waiting?
What do you want from me at this hour?
Wait, aren't you the\nAll-Japan player we just played?
What do you want with me?
I want to ask about Netherlands soccer.
I want to practice with foreign players.
Netherlands soccer? From me? You're an odd kid.
Usually, when talking about soccer as played in\nthe Netherlands people only want to talk to the\nstrikers.
But hey, since you came all this way,\nI guess I can spare a few minutes!
And you needed to do it right now, huh?
Anyways, we got a meeting soon.\nSo I can't practice now.
But if you're interested in players\nfrom other countries... So am I!
We can talk a little bit.
Okay, we're about to start the meeting.
Oops, gotta go! That's all I can say.
If you can come again,\nlet's get some practice in!
See ya later!
I've got time today! Zróbmy to!
Let's warm up and then face off a bit!
Hey, nice shot! Blocking that took some doing.\nYou move well. That was great practice.
Our national team has a bunch of\nplayers who came up from the same club.
Practicing with club members and members of the\nnational team involves a lotta the same people.\nWe're really good, but we read each other easily.
I got a lot out of practicing with you!
Gotta keep things fresh for practice!
This was super helpful.
Ha ha! I guess that's true!
If I keep facing the same lineup over and over\nagain, I get too used to one group's style no\nmatter how hard I try not to.
So I try to practice with new players.\nIt keeps me on my toes.
Practice with an unfamiliar\nplayer forces me to improvise.
Same with you, huh? You came all this\nway to master some new techniques.
Awesome! I like your attitude!
<avatar_name>, let's do this again sometime!
I need to learn more about my opponents!
Hey <avatar_name>! Ready for more practice?
Yeah, me, too. I like joining in\nother teams' individual practices.
Practicing with you reinvigorates\nmy love of soccer. It's fun again!
I've heard that the Japanese national team\nis assembled from various regional clubs.
So you're always practicing with players\nwho weren't your original teammates?
That's the secret to\nJapan's constant improvement!
Exactly. I learn so much!
No, I'm just that good.
I've learned a lot just from your attitude.
I wonder if you could even take on Kluivoort...
Playing against the same line-up,\nI got used to it, without even noticing.
I wish I had a team of first-class\nstrikers to practice against!
If I practice enough to where I can stop\nKluivoort's shot, well, maybe I'm first-class,\ntoo!
It wasn't the place to get comfortable.\nThat really sank in this time.
I have to keep improving until I can block any\nshot from any player for the Netherlands...\nFrom any player for any team!
I'm gonna make it so that people can say\n"The Netherlands? Oh, you mean Dolman's team!"
That's why you have to become famous\nbefore our next game, <avatar_name>.
Cause then I'll block you out completely\nand get that much more popular!
Heh, you've got the makings of a good rival.\nYou keep working hard and I will, too.







Whoo!
Ohh!
Here we go!
Gotcha!
Take that!
Dive in!
Drive forward!

Nice to be shooting for a change!
Yes!
Gol!
Call it a fluke, but a point's a point!
A keeper can do offense, too!
What do you think about that?
Yes! Now, get us back in the lead!
Let's trap them in the Inferno Formula!
Guys, we really have to get more points!
My bad, guys!
I swear on my Right Hand, no more goals!
I'm sorry! Let's rally together!
Bello! Beautiful play!
Nice going!
Fine work!
This is bad!
Wha...?!
They won't get past me!
Awesome pass!
Alright!
On it!
Got it!
It's time!
Here!
Ball me!
Pass!
Hey guys, it's catenaccio time!
Time to wall up, everyone!
Everyone, attack!
My Golden Right Hand can't be beat!
My Perfect Keeper name is on the line!
This shot won't get past my Right Hand!
Those shots won't work on me, Tsubasa!
Nice shot, Hyuga! It packed a punch!
You'll get no goals today, Misaki!
That all ya got, Matsuyama?
You know what you're doing, Misugi!
Hehe, that was inventive, Tachibana!
That's not fast enough, Nitta!
A little curve won't fool me, Soda!
Remember last year, Schneider? Payback!
Didn't see that coming! Artisan indeed!
Heine, you're a riot!
I'm the Perfect Keeper, Pierre!
You'll get nothing past me, Napoleon!
No goals for you, Kluivoort!
I know you can do better, Rusciano!
A pleasure to face you, Carlos!
You have a strong spirit, Alberto!
Nice to have a chance to face you, Diaz!
You give it your all, Victorino! Nice!
That's not a bad shot, Senghor!
That's not gonna work, Diallo!
Don't underestimate this Right Hand!
That won't break this wall, Blake!
The Golden Right Hand is still thriving!
It's easy to counter aggressive attacks!
Let them come. I will guard the goal!
They're starting to slack on defense!
Take your best shot! I'm waiting!
Ahh, so, that's the kind of training Tsubasa\nand Hyuga do?
They must be super strong if they can\npull off that kind of tricky stuff.\nI'll have to work just as hard.
Zino, there you are!
Zaraz zacznie się mecz.
Oh, wow, already?
They're airing a live broadcast of an Italian\nLeague game and we're all getting together to\nwatch it.
You're <avatar_name>, right?\nYou can come if you want!
I grabbed some Italian snacks from the dorms, too.\nLet's relax and chow down a bit.
You should come watch it with us if you're free.
You guys okay if he comes along?
Sure. I don't mind.
You... You're that kid who said I was cheeky.
Tardelli, wait—
Thanks. I had some thinking to do.\nIt helped me grow.
So, yeah, come with us! I've got some Italian\nsnacks today, too. Let's have them while we watch!
You should come watch it with us if you're free.
You guys okay if he comes along?
Sure. I don't mind.
You... You're that kid who said I was cheeky.
Tardelli, wait—
Come watch us practice some time.\nI'll show you how I've grown.
But that aside, if you're a friend of Zino's,\nyou're a friend of ours.
So, come with us!\nWe'll treat you to some Italian snacks!
Heh... Leave it to Italy.\nOur players have the best defense in the world!
He sure made a whole show out of that tackle, huh?\nEven his expression was like, "in your face!"
He's provoking the opponent, right?
He's likes to stand out, right?
I'm not so sure.
The opponent's feelings aside, it doesn't look\nlike that was the player's intent, at least to me.
Absolutely.\nHe's famous for showboating now and then.
Speaking of which, that show was\napparently meant for his teammates.\nI read about it in an interview.
Wait, for his teammates?
Yep.
I'm pretty sure... Hold on, here it is.
"The defense has to work the hardest when your\nteam has the lead."
"The opponent attacks you in a desperate effort to\ncatch up. But the scariest part is your own team\ngetting swallowed up by that offensive wave."
"So, to keep that from happening,\nI concentrate even harder on defending."
"I make a big show to land a tough tackle,\nall to encourage my team."
"And besides,\nisn't it more fun seeing showy plays?"
Ha! That last line is so him.
...
You okay, Zino?
Oh yeah, that just got me thinking.
When the opposing team gets extra aggressive on\noffense, that's a perfect chance for the defense\nto show off by shutting them down.
If anything, I'd say I've trained myself to stay\ncentered in any situation.
That said, as a keeper, maybe I need to think\nabout putting in extra effort when we're out in\nfront.
And I think I get what he meant when he talked\nabout encouraging your teammates with a showy\ntackle.
With Italy's current approach being to score first\nand then hold on to the lead,\nI think it's a good way of thinking.
<avatar_name>, I know you're a forward, but\ndefending up front is also super important.
<avatar_name>, you're a midfielder, so you know\nthe midfield's defense has to be rock solid when\nyou're in the lead.
<avatar_name>, this article probably spoke to you\nsince you're a defender.
Defense is a major part of soccer. It's not just\nstopping the opponent pushing in. Sometimes you\nneed to show off a bit to encourage the team.
It might work better than one would think.
Let's do everything we can.\nWe need to keep our team energized on the field.
That jersey... A Japanese player?\nWhat brings you here?
You're Japan's number 23, right?\nWhat brings you here?
Huh? You came to see Zino?
One sec, hold on.
Hey! You here to visit me?
Oh, so your name's <avatar_name>?
I'm Zino Hernandez. Nice to meet you.
You're... <avatar_name>, right?
This is the first time we've met outside a match.\nIt's nice to really meet you.
So? Did you need something from me?
I want to go one-on-one with Hernandez!
I want to experience Italian soccer.
With me?
Oh? You're interested in Italian soccer?
I'd love to kick a ball around with you,\nbut the field's undergoing maintenance right now.\nSo you'll have to come back another day.
Sorry, but my right arm's injured.\nI'm not supposed to move around today.
How about we have a little talk about soccer\ninstead? I know it's not quite as good, but...
Actually, there are tons of things I'd like\nto ask about other countries' soccer, too.
I see. Sounds like Japanese\nsoccer is pretty deep, too.
Thanks. I learned a lot today.
Feel free to drop in some other time.
Hey <avatar_name>! You're back!
We were just about to split up\ninto teams for a team scrimmage.
You can watch from over there if you like.
We can watch it together if you like.
Gah! Stop Rusciano!
(There's an opening behind their defense!\nNow's our chance!)
Hyah!
Hey, Rusciano! How was I supposed to get to that\nlong pass?! Send it somewhere I can reach it!
Huh?! What are you even talking about?!
I made the perfect pass to score a goal! Isn't\nit your job to get over there and receive it?!
Wha?!
What, you wanna start something?!
Could you two cut it out?
Zino...
I think Rusciano's right.
Shouldn't you be trying to keep up?
Wh-What?!
Who asked you?! You're not even on this team!
Ha ha ha! Looks like these guys\nknow soccer way better than Tardelli!
Wh-What did you say?!
Tardelli, you messed up on the play just now.
Z-Zino...
Like Rusciano said, if you'd gone after that\nball that would've been a decisive opportunity.
Besides, you said you couldn't\nkeep up with that pass...
But wouldn't you be able to run even faster to\nmeet the pass if you'd seen the opening behind\nthe opponent?
I-I guess, but...
Remember our match with Japan? While they were\ndesperately searching for any holes in our\ndefense...
They didn't slack off and ran as hard as they\ncould to beat us to the punch, didn't they?\nWhile we caved to the pressure...
Our forwards have to be like Japan's... Always\nlooking for that opening, and then never letting\ngo when we find one. Don't you agree, Tardelli?
...
Got it, Zino. I'm one of Italy's forwards, too.\nI have to work harder.
What you guys said also ticked me off.
Tch.
I can tell you're serious\nabout soccer, <avatar_name>.
If you weren't, you wouldn't\nhave an opinion like that.
Seems like you'll be a good soccer buddy.
Gah! They're cutting off Rusciano's pass!
(The back is open! Now!)
Hyah!
What?! Oh no!
Got it!
Great shot, Tardelli!
It's just like you said. We hunted\nhard for an opening, and it went great!
Don't start celebrating now.\nOnly an idiot would miss a shot like that.
Wha?!
(But I'm lucky all I had to do\nwas kick the ball into the goal.)
(In other words, Rusciano sent it to\nexactly the right place at the right time.\nI've got to admit it, he's good.)
Rusciano! Just keep 'em coming like that,\nand I'll just keep smackin' 'em into the goal!
Now you've said it!\nThen you'd better show me that you can keep up!
Dang it, I can't believe we had a hole there...
Guys! We need to rethink our coordination!
Oh, you're back <avatar_name>?
Everyone's really working hard.
All because of what their captain said.
It's all thanks to your\nharsh critiques from before.
Well, I think I coulda pushed everyone, too,\nbut hearing it from you seems to have amplified\nthe effect.
Your words seem to have struck a nerve with\nTardelli. He's been throwing himself headlong\ninto training ever since.
Hafta admit you had a hand in our improvement.
It's frustrating that we lost to you and Japan,\nbut that loss is going to help us grow even\nfurther.
It really mattered in the final match of prelims\nagainst the Netherlands. I don't think we could\nhave won that if we hadn't played you first.
Even on a personal level, your serious attitude\ntowards soccer has been a real motivator.
I'm so glad I came to this tournament.\nI've met so many friends and rivals here.
I hope we can stay in touch, <avatar_name>!
Come to think of it, we both advanced\nto the finals tournament, didn't we?
Italy's next opponent is Brazil. It'll be tough\nwith my arm injured, but... either way I'll give\nit my all.
Wouldn't it be amazing if\nwe got a rematch in the finals?
I really wanted to play you in the finals, but...\nUnfortunately Italy is out of the tournament.
So this time I'll just be\ncheering for you, as a friend.
Win the finals, <avatar_name>! I wish you luck!
I got to see your game the other day,\n<avatar_name>. You had amazing defense.
Being a keeper can be mentally exhausting,\nespecially when you're dealing with crisis\nafter crisis.
It's times like that when seeing your team\nput up their best defense cheers you up.
Like... It reminds you that\nyou're not alone out there.
So with that in mind, I want you to keep\na smile on your goalie's face for me!
What is it today, <avatar_name>?
Huh? You want to learn more about Catenaccio?
Well, I guess that's only natural for\nsomeone with an interest in Italian soccer.
Got it. Then I'll try to summarize.
Catenaccio is when most of most of your players\nreturn to their positions to focus on defense,\nwith a few front line members left to score goals.
So... I have a question for you.
What's the most important thing to keep\nin mind when tightening your defenses?
Enduring the opponent's offense.
Disrupting the opponent's offense.
That's what most people think, but it's wrong.
I knew you'd get it.
If you just take the enemy's offense head on, it\nmight work out at first, but you're just letting\nthe opponent gradually build up steam.
Like that, no matter how many people you have on\ndefense, the opponent will disrupt your formation\nwith pass work and eventually take a point.
The way to prevent that is to have\nthe whole team aim to steal the ball.\nIn other words, an aggressive defense.
By placing a harsh check on the other guys, and\nstopping them from dribbling or passing, we can\nprevent them building up an offensive rhythm.
And with no other options available,\na forward will be forced to take a wild shot.
But stopping a shot like that\nshouldn't be a problem for a good goalie.
Also, this approach isn't\njust a defensive strategy.
When we steal the ball with the opponent deep in\nour territory, there's no better timing for a\ncounterattack.
Catenaccio's tough defense is what allows\nus to swiftly take control on offense.
Of course, actually putting this\ninto practice is easier said than done.
Not only do all your players need good situational\nawareness and skills, they also need the\ncoordination to block the opponent's game plan.
Catenaccio is the pride of Italian soccer,\nand it's complex. I think it's great that\nyou're showing an interest in it.
If you like, try doing more research into it.\nI'd love to see you try it out yourself when\nyou're leading your own team.
Hey <avatar_name>.
We were all about to go watch a game from\nthe Italian League. Want to come with us?
Whoa... Right in front of the goal, too.\nWhat a tight defense.
C'mon! They're not calling\na foul after a charge like that?!
True, he hit him pretty hard, but only because\nthe guy clipped him while stealing the ball.\nHe wasn't aiming to disrupt play.
His intention was obvious, so not even\nthe ref will call a penalty on that one.
Hmm... The skills of a pro are something else.
Plus, maybe he didn't want to make a big deal\nof it because that player isn't known to play\ndirty like that.
A clean image, huh? Well, SOMEONE on\nour team certainly needs to hear that.
<avatar_name>... On defense, even a\nclean image can be a decisive weapon.
Of course, getting a foul right in\nfront of the goal can lose you the game.
I think it'd be a good idea for\nyou to keep that in mind, too.
You're defensive skills are just becoming\nmore and more polished, eh <avatar_name>?
A defense that's able to make a miraculous save\nat the last second is certainly wonderful...
But one that can stop the play before it reaches\nthat point in the first place is truly amazing.
In that sense, your defense\nlast game was practically perfect.
Not to mention seeing a good defense will\nmotivate your keeper, too. They want to play\nas hard as everyone else is.
I'm sure the Japanese goalie trusts you a lot.
So keep it up!







Haaah!
Aaah!
How's that?!
There!
Graaah!
Eat this!
Hope you're ready!























Here you go, Captain!
Tch, just leave it to me!
Fine! I'll do it!
Go fetch!
Idziemy!
Fine, fine!
C'mon, let's go!
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!

Nitta!
Jito!
Soda!
Ishizaki!
Schneider!

Azwan!
Ha! I did it!
Ha! Color me unimpressed!
I'll show you how to play!
See that? You're nothing!
No need to make a fuss!
See that? I'm number one!
Ha! And he calls himself a goalie!
Hmph. I'm just getting warmed up!
There's more where that came from!
We can't lose here!
It's time we took the lead!
Don't get careless!
We won't give up!
You're better than I thought.
Could be worse.
Hmph.
Oh no!
What the--?!
Do something!
Finally!
Alright!
My turn!
Here I go!
Here!
Pass it already!
Over here!
Just pass it!
Eat this!
Watch this!
Here I come!
Accel Shot!
Don't stop!
My kinda shot!
Outta my way!
Get outta my face!
Move it!
Here comes the pain!
Time to wrap this up!
Let's get serious!
Ha! Watch this!
Ha! Get a load of this!
Disappointing...!
I'll trample you!
Chew on this!
It's over!
Just try and stop me!
Watch a real player!
We'll see about that!
Like I'd lose to trash like you!
Grah! Why you little--!
Is that all, Hyuga?!
Hyugaaa!
That all you got, Misaki?!
Dang! You have some fancy footwork!
No one's more ready for this than I am!
He beat me?!
I won't go easy on you, Misugi!
No way! What the heck was that?!
I'M number one, Schneider!
Ugh! Losing to someone like Schneider...
Don't mess with me, Heine!
Checkin' out my moves, Heine?
I hate rich jerks!
I'll get you next time, Pierre!
Lookin' for a fight? You got one!
Gah, I won't lose next time, Napoleon!
Ha! Come back when you're better, Jean!
Darn you! I won't let this happen again!
I was expecting more, Kluivoort!
Curse you, Kluivoort!
Guess Brazil's Ace is nothing special!
Ugh... Finally, a worthy challenge!
My technique can match yours, Diaz!
Diaz... Are you trying to outpace me?!
I win, Victorino!
Impossible! How could I lose?!
You need guts to win, Senghor!
Curse you, Senghor!
It's past your bedtime, brat!
This brat beat me?! Ryaaan!
Soccer's about more than power, idiot!
B-Beaten by a musclehead like this?!
You're all just stepping stones!
There's no point if we don't win!
Get lost, losers!
Soccer's all about imagination!
Soccer ain't about numbers!
Gah. I got Rusciano'd again!
Hey, Rusciano. We're training right now.\nWould it kill you to pass me the ball every once\nin a while?
Are you dense? If you want me to pass it to you,\npay more attention to your surroundings.
Excuse me?
No way. You noticed? I was just waiting to pick\noff Tardelli when he trapped the ball.
Wha...?
Duh!
That said, you do hog the ball a bit.
And the longer he has it,\nthe sharper his plays get.
He's a difficult player to be up against,\nthat's for sure.
But that's what makes him a great training\npartner.
Yeah.\nGotta train harder so we can properly stop him!
(It's frustrating, but I've still got a ways to\ngo. I gotta keep learning from him if I want to\ncontinue playing forward for Italy.)
(Alright.\nGuess I'll head back to the dorms and wash up.)
Oh, hey there. What brings you here?
I get not wanting to let go of the ball.
You did some awesome\nstuff on your own earlier!
Oh, you mean during the practice match?
Well, yeah, I guess you and I are on a similar\nwavelength.
Ah... yeah.
I appreciate the compliment. Would prefer the\npraise from a major club's scouter, but hey...
At least, it's better than getting knocked for it.
When you're kicking the ball around, ideas pop\ninto your head one after another, right? Like on\nhow to move your body or control the ball.
So, you try stuff, which leads to other ideas,\nand your plays improve.\nI just love that feeling of clarity.
Unfortunately, the moment the ball leaves my feet,\nthe feeling goes with it.
Of course, you gotta pass or shoot eventually.\nThere's no helping that.
In any case, once I get the ball,\nI don't just let it go.\nIt lets me express those ideas I've stored up.
There's nothing in soccer quite like having\ncontrol of the ball.\nThat's why I let my imagination guide my plays.
Then, I crush the opponent with my own two feet,\nfinish the job, and take my bow.
If you wanna take me on,\ndevelop a fighting spirit and hone your skills!
Even for a national team, they're nothing special.\nPracticing with them is a waste of time.
Huh? What's with you?
No idea who you're supposed to be...\nBut what're you here for?
A Japanese player? Oh yeah, I think\nI might've seen you in a match.
So? What're you here for?
Oh, right... you. <avatar_name>?
So? What're you here for?
I want to experience how you play.
Please, practice with me!
So basically you wanna practice together?
With me?
Ha! Who do you think I am?\nI don't have time for this nonsense.
I don't practice with just anybody.
If I practice with people who suck,\nI'll just sink to their level.
How long are you going to mess around, Rusciano?\nBreak time's almost over.
Yeah yeah, I get it. What a pain...
You're still here?
Get back to your own team already. You can\nplay with someone who sucks as hard as you.
I figured there'd be more good players at\nan International Tournament... I'm so bored.
Oh, you're back again?
So why me?
Because I love your soccer.
I want to practice with great players.
Uh, thanks?
Well, I guess I'm the only one in the world who\nplays at my level. And you guys from out of town\ndon't get much chance to watch, do you?
Oh, I get it. So you realize how bad you are then.
Well, that makes you better than the rest\nof the dumbies runnin' around at least.
Fine, whatever. Better than sitting here\nspacing out. I'll play along for a bit.
But just this once, y'hear?
You're a weird guy.
This is the first time's anyone's come\nasking to practice with me over and over again.
In the club I'm from, everyone's from poor\nfamilies. All that matters to them is moving\nup in the world.
And I'm especially good, which makes me a target.\nSome people don't want me to stand out more than\nthem, so they always try to drag me down.
That's why I need to be strong.\nI need the strength to fend off\nboth my enemies and my teammates.
But still, you're not very good.\nDon't you have any instinct for soccer?
I hate practicing with other people. How does\nbringing myself down to their level help me, huh?
It's the same in a match, y'know? Lower\nyourself to play along with that useless bunch,\nand you only hurt yourself. Game over.
What's with that look?\nIt hurt that much to hear the truth?
Then put everything you've got into this shot!
If you can manage to pull this off in a real\nmatch, I'll give training with you another shot.
Anyway, that's enough for today. Scram.
Whoa there, you're back?
Now that's a confident look.\nYou figured out my shot then?
Well now... Show me.
(This kid... He really did it!)
Now keep your promise.
Still think I have no instinct for it?
Tch. Fine. A promise is a promise.
Tch. Fine. I'll admit it, you've got talent!
Then let's make this a serious showdown,\nmano a mano! We'll play 'til we drop!
Ha! You're... not half bad...\nNot many folks can keep up with me for that long.
Plus... One-on-one really is the best training.
I'm just not cut out for team practice.\nAnd if I hate the process of practicing,\nI sure as heck ain't gonna get better from it.
First, it's boring as all heck.
Second, people's are always gonna be changing\nteams or growing out of age categories. The\nnational reps aren't gonna be the same next year.
So basically, the people I have to play\nsoccer with are gonna just keep changing.
So when you think about it,\npracticing teamwork is just a waste of time.
That's why I don't rely on others.\nI only rely on myself.
I don't mesh with others. If anyone wants to\nteam up with me, they'd better match MY pace.
I play soccer my way, and I won't let\nanyone stop me. That's why I train myself.
Now, listen up. After I've kept you company\nso long, you'd better not go and lose on me.
Next time we meet had better be in the finals.\nAnd I'm definitely gonna pay you back for our\nloss in the prelims!
If Zino hadn't gotten injured, we could've...\nWhatever. I gotta face the facts. We lost.
Might as well keep watching you play.\nNot like I have anything better to do.
So try to give me a good show, alright?
Ha! Just try and take the ball!
Come on!
Don't underestimate us defenders!
Hyah!
Why you...!
Dangit!
C'mon, what's the matter?\nYou can't even catch up to me, weaklings?!
What, you here for something?
You're so good at juggling!
Is it that fun to be a jerk?
You know it. I bet you couldn't find\nanyone better than me around the globe.
Doing what now? Oh, you mean the juggling?
Of course, it's fun.\nThat's the whole point, isn't it?
Who ever heard of a soccer player training\nto steal the ball from someone juggling it?
Which is exactly why no defender's used to it!\nSeeing 'em all desperately tripping over\nthemselves to get the ball is hilarious!
Plus, when you give 'em some grief, they lose\ntheir tempers and get even sloppier about it.
They become easier to read\nand you slip right past 'em.
Oh, I know. You can juggle, right?\nWhy don't you give it a go?
If you always take the game so seriously,\nyou'll become a boring player.
Hey, <avatar_name>! I saw your last match!\nWhat the heck were you thinkin'?!
You call that a tackle? Are you even trying?!
But what if I hurt someone...?
I'm scared of getting hit...
So pathetic! Grow a spine!
Ha! If you're going to be such a wuss,\nget off the field!
Look, tackling takes more than skill.\nIt's your will against theirs.\nAnd you must inspire and exploit their fear.
You've gotta believe deep down that you're\ngetting that ball no matter what, and hit 'em\nwith everything you've got!
When you win a showdown, that'll get the hype\ntrain a rollin', and you'll play even fiercer.\nAll that's left is to take that ball and go crazy.
Listen up, <avatar_name>. Soccer is a fight.\nAnd you don't win a fight by backing down.
If you've got any confidence at all,\nthen fight to win!
If not, then you're putting\nall that talent to waste!
Eat this, Tardelli!
Alright! I'll score with a header!
Too late!
You jerk! That was my ball!
What're you talking about?\nSomething that fast has gotta score.
You, huh? What do you want?
Isn't it awkward to shoot like that?
You come up with the oddest shots.
I think you mean "why should I have to go out of\nmy way to do a header that anyone else could do?"
Let me ask you this:\nwhy couldn't you come up with that?
Besides, what's so fun about a normal header?\nIt has no flash.
You gotta shine if you want the recruiters\nto notice you. That's how you get the offers.
Also, well, if you surprise the goalie\nit's easier to score a goal. Pretty simple.
If you wanna copy me, go ahead.\nAll it takes is some athletic skill.
Yo, <avatar_name>.\nYou were great in that last match!
You've been committing to your\nplays way more than before!
Well, I guess an aggressive style like ours\nprobably looks dangerous from the outside.\nI know I hear people grumble.
But ignore the haters!\nThey can't argue with results!
Besides, where's the fun in being a\nlittle goody two shoes on the field?
There's nothin' lamer than wasting your potential\nby letting someone else drag you down to their\nlevel. What's the point of even playing then?
We play soccer for ourselves, not for them!\nDoing things our way is how we push ourselves\nto our limits! You get me, right?
What, you're back? Well, I'm not\nin the mood. Don't you know we just lost?
...
...
Fine, fine. You came all this way,\nso I might as well hear you out...
What?! You want me to show\nyou the ace up my sleeve?
...
Fine, whatever. I'll teach you the form at least.
Got a problem with that? Well soccer moves\nain't things you can teach soup to nuts.
You've gotta work out the kinks on your own.\nAm I wrong?
So keep practicing it yourself\nuntil you can use it in a game.
If you can manage that, then I will cease thinking\nof you as trash. You'll be a real soccer player.
Just remember, don't you dare lose with my move!







Rawr!
Grawh!
Hmph!
Now!
Try this on!
Yes, go, go!
Go in!























Captain!
It's yours, mate!
Trusting you!
Do it to it!
Here we go!
Let's get in there!
Time to wage war!
Tsubasa!

Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
See my pride shimmer!
Tak! I like where this is going!
Here's a step in towards victory!
I bloody did it!
Went in like a bullet!
There's more where that came from!
Man, I'm good!
I won't settle for a tie! Idziemy!
My pride is on the line! I'll defend us!
No slackin'! We're turning this around!
Let's get in there and steal the lead!
On my pride, you'll get no more points!
Keep your cool! One point at a time!
Cracking play!
Nice!
Bloody good!
Blimey!
What's all this now?
Can't let them have their way!
Brilliant pass!
Hup!
I got this!
Watch me go!
Hey!
Here!
Hey, here!
Pass!
This is the pride of soccer's homeland!
Time for you to witness our strength!
Lads, time to fight it out!
You shall not pass!
Don't even dream of getting past me!
Hold it right there!
Your talent's genuine, Tsubasa!
Blimey! Brilliant play, Tsubasa!
The Tiger's strength doesn't scare me!
Urk, you got me, Fierce Tiger!
Play like you mean it, Misaki!
Urgh, you adapt so well, Misaki!
Show me some backbone, Matsuyama!
Urk, you're tenacious, Matsuyama!
What in the blazes was that, Misugi?!
Those pretty moves of yours are loaded!
You're still not using your body right!
Takasugi... you've grown!
Was this how you played, Schneider?!
The Emperor has demonstrated his grace!
Show me how you really play, Heine!
Heine! I thought you'd just mess around!
That was a taste of my pride, Pierre!
I admire your pride, Pierre!
You're all talk, Napoleon!
I won't stay disgraced, Napoleon!
I'm a defender, too! I know what we do!
France's Shield, huh? It suits you!
You had some quick plays, Kluivoort!
Definitely a good player, Kluivoort!
You need to learn to relax, Rusciano!
Now, I see why you're so confident!
I see a few holes in your game, Carlos!
You always keep me guessing, Carlos!
A genius woulda seen that comin', Diaz!
It's that clever disposition, isn't it?
It'll take more than force, Victorino!
Victorino's got this much force?!
Your lack of confidence hurts your game.
You did great! Puff up that chest!
You gotta train that body up, Ryan!
How much have you practiced that, Ryan?!
A battle of muscle? I was born ready!
Urk, I won't lose another to you, Blake!
In the name of the soccer homeland!
I give everything I have for the win!
Hey, <avatar_name>.\nHere to watch Brazil's practice routine?
There's a certain player I came to see.
That defender.
Right side! Watch your checks!
What was that formation?! Get it right!
Ha! You're wide open!
Not gonna happen!
Over here, Leo!
Take care of it, Alberto!
Here I go!
Guess he's not Brazil's captain for nothing!
On top of taking the reins for the whole team\nfrom defense...
He doesn't limit himself to defense,\nbut acts as the starting point for attacks,\nand takes shots when running an overlap.
To be honest, I wish I could play like that.
Do you have defenders like that in Japan?
Matsuyama, maybe?
Soda and Jito are aggressive...
So he's a midfielder who was made a defender\nafter he joined the national team?
He must be quite skilled.\nI couldn't be more envious.
So you're telling me they use overlaps to really\npush in to the goal?
I gathered from the way you said it that you meant\na different sense of "aggressive." Apologies if I\ncame off kind of rude or jumped to conclusions.
In any case, I couldn't be more envious of those\nskills.
Unfortunately, that's not really in my wheelhouse\nright now.
I try my best of course, but I can't play offense\nnear as well as I play defense.
I remember being so frustrated by that\nwhen I was younger.
But I poured all of that frustration into getting\nbetter as a defender.
I would go so hard that people told me I was like\na different person on the pitch.
Eventually, that led me to a spot on the national\nteam. I take pride in my defensive playstyle.
That's why I always face my opponent head on,\nno matter what... Even if I have to jump in front\nof a powerful shot.
That's the pride I have as a rep on the national\nteam.
Defense is as essential to the team as offense.
And as the one entrusted to defend for the team,\nI play in a way that I know I won't regret the\noutcome.
I get jealous of players who can do what I can't,\nbut I accept my faults and take hold of what's\nwithin my reach.
I haven't given up on learning offense.\nI still want to get to that level someday.
Since I'm the captain I have to put everything\ninto my game and push my team to be better.
Sorry, I've been rambling.
I'll treat you to some English tea to make it\nup to you.
We really need to talk more about soccer!
Hmm? What's up with you?
Oh, aren't you...
Japan's number 23, <avatar_name>, right?
I try to remember the name and\nface of everyone I play against.
Oh right, I should be thanking Japan. You really\nhumbled us in the scrimmage. We needed that.
So? What brings you here?
One of the Japanese players, I think? Sorry, I\ndon't recognize you. So what brings you here?
Can we start training together?
Please, go head-to-head with me.
Train together?
If you're offering, then personally\nI don't mind, but...
A personal match between you and me?\nOoh, sounds fun.
Of course, I wouldn't plan to lose\neven in a friendly one-on-one, but...
Sorry, I can't. As the captain of the English\nteam, I've got a lot of things I need to get done.
Come back later, if you get the chance.\nSeeing as we've talked face to face like this,\nI'll definitely remember you.
Anyway, I've got to go.
Alright, that's enough for today.\nWe all need some time to rest.
You came to see me again, <avatar_name>?
Oh, I see, you were waiting for\nour practice to wrap up. Thanks.
Okay, then let's chat while\nkicking this ball around a bit.
Ooh, you've got some nice moves. I can tell\nthey're a work in progress, but you've got a\nfoundation that could weather many a storm.
Still, there's some unevenness there.\nDon't trust yourself?
Compared to the world's best, I'm...
Compared to the other reps, I'm...
I see. Yeah, I've been feeling the same thing.\nThe world's a big place.
Oh, I get it. It's a gathering of all the best\nplayers from your country, and to top it off,\nyou're the youngest of them.
When you're surrounded by talent like that, I can\nsee how they'd look like they're towering over\nyou.
But it's only natural that you'll bump into\na wall or two when you first step out your door\ninto the wider world.
But that's when it's most important\nto have pride in yourself.
Without that, you'll never put in the effort,\nand you'll never improve.
To be frank, England hasn't exactly been doing\nas well as we'd hoped, but I remain resolute.
All we can do is our best.\nYou and me both, <avatar_name>.
Dang it! This isn't nearly good enough\nif I'm going to lead this team!
Oh, <avatar_name>? You stopped by again?
I was just working out some stuff on my own.\nMind tagging along for a bit?
I watched your match, but it didn't sink in just\nhow much you'd improved until we kicked the ball\naround like this.
Return on investments, I suppose? You're good.
Thanks, you're a lifesaver. There are a\nlot of things I can't work on, on my own.
Why are you by yourself then?
Your teammates left you out?
Oh, we've got today off, but everyone else\nis feeling a little discouraged.
Ha ha! In a certain sense, I suppose.
Oh, we've got today off, but everyone else is\nfeeling a little discouraged, and stayed in\nthe dorm.
It's because we couldn't make it past the prelims.\nI'm sure they'll bounce back, but for now they've\nlost their drive to play.
Still, this is exactly the sort of time I wish\nthey'd be at least proud enough to hit the field.
True, we don't have any of the big names they\ntalked about before the tournament, and our\nmuscles and technique could both use some work.
But as players from the birthplace of soccer,\nwe need to keep our eyes on the future and treat\nthis disgraceful loss as a lesson.
As their captain, I figured\nI should lead by example.
Not that it's reached any of them yet...\nAs you can see.
But I won't give up. I believe that as long\nas you have your pride, both yourself and those\naround you will rise to any occasion.
Still, you're quite the gentleman, aren't you?\nPolitely listening to the grumblings of a\nforeigner without even a complaint. Thank you.
I plan to keep on bearing the heavy pride of\nEngland. And someday... win the World Cup.
More than anyone else, I'd love to play\nagainst you in those finals, <avatar_name>.
In order to enable that scenario,\nlet's both keep a stiff upper lip.
Alright guys, we're scrumming!\nGet in your positions!
That's it! Keep pushing!
Okay, let's take a breather.
Oh, it's you. Something on your mind?
What were you doing just now?
Was that some new soccer strategy?
You mean a scrum? It's something from rugby,\nanother traditional sport of England.\nWe borrowed it for our own training.
Hah, you've never heard of a scrum?\nIt's something from the sport of rugby.\nWe borrowed it for our own training.
Rugby's much more of a full contact\nsport that requires brute strength,\nso we use it to toughen up our bodies.
Besides, while my parents may have blessed me with\na statuesque physique, not everyone's so lucky.
By training how to use their strength in a scrum,\nthey can all get used to using their whole body\nwhen necessary.
Strength is important in soccer, and knowing\nhow best to impose your physique is even more\nimportant.
Of course, I'm not saying to go full throttle all\nthe time, but with the right timing you can plow\nthrough bigger guys on the field.
Not to mention a scrum is only won if everyone\nworks in unison. It helps foster team solidarity,\ntoo.
If the whole team can make use of their strength\nat just the right time, it can be beneficial on\nboth offense and defense.
I'm not saying you have to play rugby yourself,\njust that you should know how to draw out your\ninner beast. And, naturally, lead by example.
Hey, you've certainly been busy.\nI've been watching your games.
So what brings you here?\nYou wouldn't be here at this time of day\nif you didn't have something to talk about.
How do I get into a defensive mindset?
I want you to teach me that block move.
Ah, always eager to learn.
Well, there are all sorts of ways. How about I\nteach you the trick behind my famous blocking?
Oh? You've got your eye on my block then?
Sure, why not? I wouldn't call it a move exactly,\nbut I'll teach you the thinking behind it.
I suppose you think that a block\njust needs to stop a shot, right?
That's certainly your first priority, but a block\nfundamentally means a loose ball. Try to look one\nstep ahead, and think about its effects on others.
For example, if my block makes the opponent\nhesitate to take their next shot, then I call\nthat a win.
You want them to think "he stopped it that\neasily?" Which means blocking even the toughest\nshots like it's easy.
It's also effective to chip away at their fighting\nspirit by showing that you're more powerful than\ntheir shots.
The exact method depends on your opponents and the\nsituation, but the important thing is to take away\nyour opponent's will to attack.
I always try to shave away\nat their morale with every block.\nAnd I'm confident that it bears results.
Still, don't get me wrong. The most important\nthing is still to actually stop the shot.
Just try to keep in mind how you might also\nintimidate your opponent while you're at it.\nIn your own way, at least.

Nothing to get worked up about.
Isn't it obvious?
Whatever gets us closer to the win.
Their goalie isn't worth beans.
I'm the best you'll ever meet.
That wasn't worth all this commotion.
What a useless opponent.
All we've done is tie the game.
No need to go easy on them.
We haven't lost the game yet.
We'll soon have a huge lead over them.
So long as we win.
You all need to give me the ball more.
Good play.
Jeez.
Keep doing that.
No...
Huh?!
Get 'em!
Good pass.
Yes!
Let me handle this!
Do or die!
Yo!
Over here!
Bola! Pass me the ball!
Just pass it already!
Heh.
Let's rock it!
Take this!
Pierce the goal!
See the fruits of my training!
This will break all the way through!
Break through!
This is the one!
Try and stop this one!
Try this on for size!
I'll show you something special.
You'll never read this shot...
Okay! Now!
No sweat.
I owe ya one.
Ha! I came out on top, Tsubasa!
Why? Why is it so frustrating?!
I thought a Fierce Tiger would be fiercer.
It seems I misjudged you, Hyuga.
Leo's the better player, eh, Misaki?
You did a number on us, Misaki!
No point in hanging on, Matsuyama.
Ugh, how can anyone be so stubborn?!
A battle doesn't need beauty, Misugi.
I suppose you do have some technique.
I'm the world's best, Schneider! Me!
I won't get beat next time, Schneider!
You're not worth the fuss, Heine.
Okay, you have some talent!
This... is the French General?
Can't believe you, Pierre!
I severely outmatch you, Napoleon.
Impossible. I couldn't... Napoleon!
Hardly worth my time, Jean.
You surprised me, Jean!
The rumors outgrew you, Kluivoort.
That was a little unexpected, Kluivoort!
Soccer needs no imagination, Rusciano!
Why is your soccer so... so irritating?!
Melhor, Leo. You can do better!
Leo, you've improved!
I know a stronger Alberto than this.
That's the Alberto I know!
You can't compete with me, Diaz.
Prodigy... bah! I just don't see it.
I outdo you in both power and technique.
No! What an embarrassing defeat!
My technique outshines yours, Senghor!
Huh, surprisingly decent, Senghor.
Who can call it better, eh, Ryan?
How do you predict my movements?!
Your power is useless against me, Blake.
Ugh, I have to hit the gym!
I exist for one thing: winning!
Meu Deus, is this what you want?
Friends aren't necessary for soccer.
I must become the world's best player!
I carry the team!
Days before the Junior Youth World Challenge\nbegins...
Time for a practice match!
This'll be our last chance to fine-tune before the\ntournament, so figure out what you want to work on\nand get to it!
Woohoo!
Heh!\nI'm gonna show my ability to control the field!
Then, I hope you're ready to see me block every\nshot that comes my way!
My whole job as a forward is to score,\nso you can bet I'll find a way!
Everyone's really hyped up today.
Huh? Haven't you noticed, Alberto?
Noticed what?
There are a bunch of scouts from big time\nBrazilian club teams in the stands today.
Oh! Now, I get why everyone's psyched to play.
Well, I won't tell them not to try to look good\nfor the scouts, but it probably won't be good\nif that's all they're thinking about.
What can you do? Getting a scout's attention might\nopen the door to a transfer.
Maybe it's not that big a deal to you since you're\nalready on a famous team, but everyone wants to\nplay for a good team.
Yeah, I get that.
It's only been a few days since the Brazil Junior\nYouth team was formed, so I'm still learning about\nmy teammates.
But they'll all be playing their hardest to stand\nout to the scouts, right?\nI think this experience will come in handy later.
(Getting a transfer to a famous team...\nSure would be nice if I could do that, too.)
(Too bad that won't happen.)
(Oh? I think something in the stands might be\nbothering Carlos.)
(No way...)
Carlos.
...
Huh?
Hey, Leo! Come here!
Be right over!
(It doesn't matter who's watching.\nI'm going to do what I have to. Score and win.)
Sick goal, Carlos!
Did that pass work well for you?
Yeah. Good stuff.
Cool.
Sorry my assists weren't that good today.\nI'll lock it in come game time.
Sounds good.
Anyway, your shot was power packed today.
Did you really have to put so much heat on a shot\nduring a practice match, though?
I suppose not.
Something up?
It's just that... you never know who's watching.
(Watching? Wait, who's watching?)
(Does he mean someone in that sea of an audience?)
(Or... Someone hired to keep tabs on him?!)
(I wouldn't put it past a team owner to do something\nlike that.)
(He probably sensed someone observing him from the\nstands.)
(Someone meant to report back to the owner about\nhow he's playing.)
(That'd explain why he was going so hard.\nHe's constantly proving he can compete\ninternationally.)
(That's so depressing.\nHow long is this going to continue? I hate it.)
Junior Youth World Challenge Quarterfinals the day\nafter Brazil vs. Italy...
...
Hey, Leo. Is it me or is Carlos more bent out of\nshape than normal?
Yeah. I think he's upset that he couldn't play\nthe way he wanted to against Argentina and Italy.
(In the final preliminaries, Argentina focused\nfully on defense and shut out all of my shots,\nforcing the game to draw.)
(And against Italy, I couldn't score on Hernandez\nwith a single solid shot, even when his hand was\ninjured.)
(What I need right now is a powerful shot.)
(I have an idea. Put a stronger, more complex\nspin on the ball to both confuse the goalie and\nincrease the strength.)
(But in my current physical state, generating\nthat much spin causes more strain than my body\ncan handle.)
(The training room should open any minute now.)
Carlos, where are you headed?
To the training room.
Oh, I'll tag along.
Me, too!\nWorking out early's the stuff of champions!
I know they've let us use it a couple times,\nbut every time I do, I'm surprised how good\nthese facilities are.
I would've thought your club's training facilities\nare decked out.
Yeah, I heard they're top notch.
Well, it is true the owner's rich, but...
...
I gotta say, this exercise area is fantastic.
Can't disagree. It's easy to see why the Americans\nare such a powerhouse.
Hey, aren't those the people from the famous\nclubs? The ones who were watching our practice\nmatch?
You're right. Good morning!
Morning. You're some of the players from Brazil\nJunior Youth, aren't you? We're taking a good look\nat your games.
Y-You are? Awesome!
You just got out of the training room, right?\nIs something going on?
Just looking around. We've been trying to see how\nwe're equipped compared to others.
You must be a pretty big club\nto travel internationally for that.
Haha! It's flattering you think so.
Oops. We should get going. We're going to be\ntaking the newest training course after this.
A new training course...
Scientific advances have allowed training to\nevolve steadily.
We've seen several cases in which the training\nregimens we use seem old-fashioned by American\nstandards.
Really?!
They're that different? I'm a little curious now.
We want to squeeze every ounce of potential out\nof talented kids like you, so we need to\nconstantly be learning, ourselves.
Well, good luck!
I guess that's why they're the best clubs.\nThey work passionately to better their teams.
The evolution of training... Sounds pretty cool.
...
Now, let's work like our lives depend on it!
Okay!\nLet's round the day out with a practice match!
Let's strategize how we'll play against Germany\nby imagining the game. Sound good?
Tak!
(So, Keizinho's the opposing goalie.)
(In that case...\nYeah, I think there's something I can try.)
(Time to see how my plans are really coming\ntogether!)
Oof, way to go, Carlos.\nYou even scored on Keizinho.
Sweet goal, Carlos!
...
Carlos?
Yo, Carlos! You got me good today, man.\nThat shot was awesome!
Actually, I wanted to ask you, did that shot feel\ndifferent? From my usual shots, I mean.
Different? Hmm...
I can't say for sure, but it kinda felt like it\nhad more of a weird spin on it than normal...\nI think?
...Okay.
Um, did I say something wrong?\nHe seemed kinda disappointed.
He wanted to run something by you, right?
If so, you did the right thing telling him exactly\nwhat you felt.
Hmph!
(It's not working...\nThe spin is nowhere near where it needs to be.)
(I'm doing the training the team put together.\nI haven't missed a day, but I'm not really seeing\nits effects... Why?)
...
(Maybe it's like what the people from those clubs\nsaid this morning. Maybe our training is...)
(Times like these, I wish I could do what that guy\nfrom Japan does and ask around.)
(But... I can't do that.)
(The only thing I can do right now is stay\non course.)
(I've set out on my journey to become the best\nplayer in the world. All I can do is stay on the\npath.)
Junior Youth World Challenge Semifinals.\nBrazil vs. Germany.
A free kick from just outside the penalty box!\nBrazil could not wish for a better opportunity!
Forget the wall.\nIt'll only make the shot harder to see.
What's this? Germany's wall is nowhere to be seen!\nAre they giving Brazil the win for free?!
Oh!
I'm gonna make you regret your attitude!
What?!
That night...
Ugh. Nothing tastes as bitter as defeat.\nAnd we were so close to the finals.
That match painfully drove home how stiff\ncompetition is out there in the wide world.
But we can't stay upset.\nWe have to focus our energy on getting better.
That's absolutely right.
Ah!
I wonder who that is.\nYou rarely see Carlos get a phone call.
...
...?
Hey, Leo. Still in the hospital?
Also, how are Keizinho's fingers?
Days later...
I was not expecting to play any more practice\nmatches considering the finals are tomorrow.
Sounds like it was a request from the American\nteam. Eh, it's better than plain old practice,\nanyway.
Hey, Keizinho, how are your fingers doing?\nSeemed pretty banged up from the game with\nGermany.
Oh, nah. They're fine.\nDislocated a couple joints but nothing broke!
That's fine?!
...
Hey, Carlos. How're ya feeling?
...
I'll be sending it your way as usual,\nso make it count, eh?
...
He's been acting like that for a while now,\nhasn't he?
Yep. No matter who asks what... Silence.
He's been like that ever since he got that call\nthat other day. I wonder what the deal is.
(A phone call...?)
Okay, let's start heading over to the pitch!
Hey guys, today's match is probably going to be\nthe last one we have as a team.
The tournament itself didn't go as planned, but\nwe can finish on a high note. Let's win this one!
Tak!
Alberto...\nThere's something I want to tell everyone.
Well, that's a surprise, but go ahead.
For today's match, I don't want any of you taking\nshots. Leave all that to me.
Wha...?!
You're going to play with the sole aim of helping\nme score. Got it?
Seriously, Carlos?!
(Carlos always had a bit of a ball hog streak,\nbut...!)
What's gotten into you?!\nI dunno what's going on, but this is too much!
(That call... Could it have been?!)
Now, wait just a minute. Where did that come from?\nDo you understand what you're asking us to do?!
Tak! We're not here just to make you look good,\nyou know!
Are you trying to turn this into the Carlos Show?\nYou really expect us to do that?!
Everyone, shut up for a second.
Carlos, even I'm having a hard time giving you a\npass for this. Can you at least explain yourself?
It's simple. If the best player takes all the\nshots, there's a better chance of scoring,\ngiving the team a better chance of winning.
Okay, even if that were true,\nthat's not really how soccer works.
That's how MY soccer works.\nThere's no point in playing if you don't win.
...!
And if I said I couldn't agree to this?
Then, I would do whatever I have to do to get the\nball. Even take it from a teammate.
You mean steal from your own team?!
Carlos, why would you do something like that?!
...
...
Fine. Today we'll play how Carlos wants.
Alberto!
You can't be serious!
Well, Carlos is dead serious.\nI fully expect him to do what he said he'd do.
...
I don't want anyone to get hurt before going home.\nAnd I don't want to put him in a position where he\nmight hurt us.
...
So, we're going to play following Carlos's lead in\nour match with America today.
We will funnel the ball to him more than ever.\nAre we clear?
Y... Tak!
Carlos, we're putting you ahead of us,\nso you better...
I know. I'll make sure this works. No matter what.
We did it... I guess.
Yeah, we won but it just doesn't feel right.
Hey, congrats...\nThough, you don't seem too happy about it.
Yeah, sorry about that. We're kinda going through\nsomething.
I will say, you guys didn't feel like the usual\nBrazil. It seemed your entire play revolved around\none person.
That's true. It definitely emphasized Carlos's\nplays more than in any previous matches.
Which actually kinda proves that his method works.\nEven if it wasn't any fun.
Ah, I know what that's like.
Oh?
Never mind. That's for us to worry about.
There's also a huge difference in how exciting a\nreal game is versus a practice match.\nMaybe the real fun doesn't happen in practice.
We'll have some real fun one day in a serious\nmatch where we play our very best against one\nanother.
Definitely. Let's keep working hard so that day\nwill really mean something.
(I'm pouring out all I have for my ultimate goal\nof being the best soccer player in the world.)
(I'll even become a soccer-playing machine...\nA Soccer Cyborg! If that's what it takes.)
(I'll solidify this style where I always get the\nball and score all of the goals.)
(Then, in two years, I'll come back to the\ninternational youth tournament stronger than ever\nand win the title for Brazil.)
(And when the time comes to rise up as the best\nplayer, I'll take this team and...)
(Carlos... I wish it weren't true, but I don't\nknow how to make you smile and enjoy the game\nanymore.)
(But I haven't given up. If you keep improving\nyour skills, I'll always have your back.)
(And I promise you, one day...!)
Everybody! Were having a practice match!
Practice is great, but it's time to test\nthose skills! Let's do it!
(Let's see what works.)
You're on, Carlos!
Gah!
(Alright!)
My turn! Take this!
Wh-What the...?!
I'll stop him!
(Time to kick it up a notch!)
Ugh! He's sharp!
(In this situation, even at this distance...!)
Owww... He has that much power at that distance?\nYou're nuts today, Carlos!
...
Oh, man... Carlos really did us in today.
It was like he doubled in strength every time\nhe dribbled past us.
When we kept stopping him it looked like he slowed\ndown, but once he got through he shot right back!
Seriously. Did he learn some new trick\nor something?
Oh, it's you, <avatar_name>.
What did you find out today?
Is there some secret to\nhow you played today?
...
You've got a keen edge to ya.
Yeah, I realized something recently.
It's not exactly a secret,\nbut there was something I wanted to try out.
It's surprisingly hard to be aware of your own\nsituation.
In practice you can watch a video and see your\nmovements, but that's not an option mid-game.
So when you're in trouble you have to feel out\nyour body and what to do. I just tried an idea\nthat I got.
I think the key to understanding your situation\nis dribbling.
When you dribble straight past your opponents,\nthat means your body is moving in an ideal way.\nYour game is on point.
On the other hand, if you mess up your dribble,\nit means your body or your skills aren't working\nthe way they need to.
When that happens you have to ease\noff the throttle. Trust your senses,\nsearch for the problem, and adjust.
The result is what you just saw.
Sorry, am I yammering on?
Later.
Interesting...\nWhat Carlos was saying reminds me of something.
Back before I retired, sometimes in the middle\nof a match I would have an epiphany.\nEverything would just feel right.
It was only a feeling, but my body and technique\nwould sync up, and I could feel myself playing\nharder.
It was like a feedback loop, constantly making my\nmovements more consistent and pushing me harder.
But there was a downside.\nIt's great when it's going well, but...
Once I noticed something felt wonky, the more\nI thought about it, and the more it threw me off\nmy game.
Before I knew it, I lost a step and couldn't even\nplay at my normal level. I was drowning fast.
Carlos was the same in America.
First, Ryan stopped his dribble. He tried to make\nup for it, but he ended up getting stopped over\nand over until he lost sight of his game.
Once that happens, it's hard to come back.
So you hafta keep things good.
What do I do if that happens?
You're right, but the thing about soccer is that\nit doesn't always go your way.
Well...
Let me tell you how I dealt with it.
When I felt like I was off my game, I'd find\nsomething positive to focus on. Anything.
Like "that kick wasn't bad" or "I got a good eye\non the ball." That would distract me from the bad\nfeelings.
Focusing on that one positive thing gradually\nbrought me back to myself.
Of course, when things are going well, you don't\nhave to think about it. Just follow your instincts\nand try to trip up your opponent.
Sometimes you can go above and beyond, and other\ntimes you can't find the strength you know you\nhave. That's the fun and the torture of sports.
My hope for you, <avatar_name>,\nis that you enjoy soccer to the fullest.
Leo! Practice is starting!
Sorry! My cleats came untied. Let's go.
Oh, hey, <avatar_name>. What is it today?
You're... from the Japanese team?
Move it. You're in the way.
Teach me the ways of Brazilian soccer!
I want to train with you, Carlos!
No can do. We're about to have a team practice.
No can do. We're about to have a team practice.
Move it, or I'll move you myself.
Carlos.
He's here because he respects\nBrazil's style of soccer.
He's here because he respects you.
Even if you're too busy today, couldn't you\nhelp him out when you have the time?
...
Fine. Come another day.\nIf I have time then, I'll help you.
Now, move it already.
Come by again sometime.
Going somewhere, <avatar_name>?
What?! Training with Carlos from Brazil?
When the heck did you...? You work fast.
<avatar_name>! Is it true?!
Do you... Do you mind if I join you?
I want to experience playing\nBrazil's number 10 for myself!
Tsubasa, this is his thing. You shouldn't butt in.
Oh... You're right.
Sorry, <avatar_name>.\nI got a little ahead of myself there.
Practicing with Brazil's ace will surely help\nyour soccer get even better. Have a good time!
I can't wait to hear all about it.\nYou'll tell me about it, won't you?
Oh... You actually came back.
Well, I have some time.\nI'll practice with you, like I said I would.
I won't go easy on you though.\nI'm practicing for myself at my own pace.
Whether you stick around for the whole thing\nor just for what you can handle is up to you.
Let's get started.
That's enough for today.
Do you always practice by yourself?
Don't you practice with your team?
Why do you care?
Why do you care?
It's more fun to play with your friends.\n<color F03760>(Starts Brazil Route)</color>
There're goods reasons to practice solo.
Whatever.
That's right.
Every day I follow my coach's ruthless training\nand learn everything there is to know\nabout soccer.
I eat, sleep, and breathe soccer.\nEvery hour of every day.
And to me, winning is everything.\nI don't need anything else.
...
From what I saw today, you're not ready.\nDon't come 'round here again.
Sorry to interrupt. The coach wants you, Carlos.\nCome on.
Okay.
Be seeing you. Or not.
(I don't need friends. I'm fine on my own.)
Oh... You actually came back.
Well, I have some time.\nI'll practice with you, like I said I would.
I won't go easy on you though.\nI'm training for myself at my own pace.
Whether you stick around for the whole thing\nor just for what you can handle is up to you.
Let's get started.
That's enough for today.
<avatar_name>. I recognize your motivation,\nbut you still don't have what it takes.
If that's all you can muster,\nthere's no point in training with me.
What can I do to get better?
How did you get this good?
...!
I...
There you are, Carlos. The coach wants you.
Okay.
Every day I follow my coach's ruthless training<avatar_name>\nand learn everything there is to know\nabout soccer.
I eat, sleep, and breathe soccer.\nEvery hour of every day.
...
You're not ready. Don't come around here again.
(Carlos...)
Sorry to bother you during your training. See you.
Let's go, Carlos!
Nice shot, Carlos! Looking good!
Yeah. It wasn't bad.
Let's wrap it up.
Hey, <avatar_name>. What brings you here today?
<avatar_name>...\nI thought I told you not to come back.
Yet here you are. What do you want?
I want to learn to shoot like you!
I want to know more about your style!
How to shoot like me...?
Wow, you made a fan abroad, Carlos!\nThat's awesome!
Why don't you show him?
My playstyle?
Wow, you made a fan abroad, Carlos!\nThat's awesome!
How about you teach him that\nspecial shot of yours?
No. I don't have time for that right now.
Leo, let's keep practicing a little longer.
Huh?
It's going fine, but I noticed something I can\nimprove. I want to fix it before we turn in.
Oh, sure. Gotcha.
Come on, Leo!
That's an interesting move... I should try it!
Uhh... Like this?
(Is he copying Carlos's movements?)
(Is he copying Carlos's movements?)
Alright. That's enough for today.\nLet's head back, Leo.
Sure thing.
Give that a try if you think you can manage it.
(Oh, I get it! Carlos wanted to practice longer\nto show <avatar_name> his shot!)
(But that's a first...\nThe Carlos Bara I know would never do that.)
(What if Carlos was...)
<avatar_name>. I want you to make that shot\nyour own. Show Carlos what you can do with it.
Good luck. I know you won't let me down.
What?!
Wow! He totally nailed Carlos's move!
You're the first person to pull off my move\nlike that.
Maybe I was too quick to brush you off.\nYou've got talent.
That's exactly why you're my enemy.
What are you saying, Carlos?!
I have to be the best in the world.\nAnyone who gets in my way is my enemy.
When we face Japan in the nationals I won't\nhesitate to crush you with everything I have.\nBe ready.
Sorry. I'm not in a position to talk so tough.
Carlos...
But I'm not done yet.\nI'm sure we'll face each other someday.\nYou'd better be ready for it, because I will.
Maybe I'll see you in Finals.
I won't hesitate to crush you\nand Tsubasa with everything I have.
I can't wait!
I won't go down without a fight!
You... can't wait?
I don't get you.
What's with that confidence of yours?
I don't get you.
(It's not often Carlos sees someone as a rival.)
(You're really something else, <avatar_name>!)
I thought I told you you're my enemy.\nWhy are you here again?
I want to improve my game!
I want to know how you really play.
...
(This guy is just like I used to be...)
...!
(Why is he so interested in me...?)
(You're a mysterious guy, <avatar_name>.)
(He should just be an enemy to crush, but...\nFor some reason I want to help him improve.)
(Not only that...\nI want to go against him in a serious match.)
(It feels just like back when I decided to help\nLeo and the other guys.\nI thought I threw that weakness away...)
...
Fine. I'll teach you.
Before I said to get good at soccer you have to\neat, sleep, and breathe it.\nThat's true, but there's more to it.
Before I said I eat, sleep, and breathe soccer.\nIt takes more than that, though.
To really be good at soccer, you have to...
Several Years Ago\nBara FC Escolinha\n(a youth soccer school)
How do you get that good?
...
You're smart enough to figure it out yourself.
...
<avatar_name>. Keep on climbing to the finals.
Then I'll beat you and be\nthe best soccer player in the world.
This tournament showed me how\nhelpless I really was.
That was when I decided to throw away everything\nthat didn't bring me closer to victory...\nTo being the best player in the world.
<avatar_name>. You should follow your own path.
Good luck.
I was planning to destroy you next time we\nfaced each other, but it might not be as easy\nas I thought.
Let's have a good match in the finals.\nYou deserve that much when I beat you\nand become numero uno.
Until then.
<avatar_name>! Come on!
You're not there yet,<avatar_name>.\nThat tackle won't stop a world-class player!
Hmm... Oh! Look at that.
Here I come, Carlos!
Gah!
In that defensive play, Carlos threw both his\nlegs out and dove right at the opponent's feet\nto steal the ball.
Now that's a world-class tackle.\nWatch and learn; you don't get a chance\nlike this every day!
Hey, Carlos. This has bugging me for a while,\nbut... Why don't you kick normally?
...
H-Hey, wait!
There's a technique fitting of Carlos Bara.
He steps on the ball with his\ntoes to give it an intense backspin.
Then he kicks it forward a little, and when\nit comes back, he intercepts it, and shoots.
The recoil on the ball coming toward him\nincreases the force of the shot.
It's the same logic as when Tsubasa countered\nHyuga's Tiger Shot with a Drive Shot.
The backspin you put on it yourself might not\nproduce as much force as that shot,\nbut you can shoot in any situation.
It's an interesting idea.
More than anything, it shows just how driven\nhe is. He'll do anything to squeeze just\na little more power out of a shot.
You sure know a lot.
I see it the same way.
I used to be a striker for Japan. I like to\nthink I know a thing or two about shots.
You know your stuff.
If you want to try out that shot,<avatar_name>\nI can help you practice.
To be honest, watching you guys play here in\nAmerica has gotten me more fired up than I've\never been since I retired.
I can't play with you because of my eye,\nbut I can coach you.
Let's head to the training grounds.
Come on! We're going, Carlos!
...Hmph.
Wh-What?
Lucas... He's just charging in against Carlos?!\nTalk about crazy.
Sh-Shut up!
It's a real pain when you're on defense and the\nguy dribblin' turns around or slips the ball\nout of sight.
It's hard to read their next move.
That's right! And when they use their head...
If you watch the sides, you'll be slow to react\nto heading, but if you watch their head...\nRight?
Brazilian soccer is a tough nut to crack.
Hmm? Interested in that move, <avatar_name>?
I'll practice with you if you want. I'm sure\nyou'll be able to master it no problem.\nI'm a little interested, too.
All right! Let's head back and get practicin'!
<avatar_name>. What do you want today?
A question for me? What is it?
Are you bad at passing?
Why don't you ever pass?
You've got a lotta nerve to talk to me like that.
There's just no reason to. It's not that I can't.
Fine. You want proof of what I can do?\nGet on the pitch.
We'll both run as fast as we can<avatar_name>\nand pass back and forth.
Idziemy!
This is a cinch. Don't underestimate me.
(He can actually keep up with me.\nI hafta give him some credit.)
(<avatar_name> ain't no normal guy.)
Let's go, Carlos!
Hmph!
I'm next!
Get it!
I got it!
You won't get me!
Get in there!
That... was awesome, Carlos!
Every time he dribbles his rhythm gets tighter!\nAnd his shots are incredible!
Just what you'd expect from the "Young Ace"!
Hmph.
Hey, <avatar_name>. You need something?
"Young Ace"?
Doesn't Carlos hog the ball too much?
What, are you psychic?\nOh, you must have heard Keizinho say it.
"Young Ace" is Carlos's nickname.
Carlos is an orphan. When he was a baby,\nhe was found on a soccer field.
After he grew into a soccer prodigy, his origin\nand his talent earned him the nickname.\nHe was literally born on the field.
That's where it comes from. Probably could've come\nup with something better, but that's what stuck.
It might seem that way, but there's a reason.
In Brazil, Carlos is a soccer prodigy known as\nthe "Young Ace." No one can stop his plays.
Realizing this, he developed his playstyle\nto win. Only to win.
Leo. Don't be a blabbermouth.
Oops... Sorry...
Listen, <avatar_name>.\nGoals are all the same whether you got out front\nby yourself or with a good pass.
That's why my playstyle is based on\nabsolute faith in my own ability.
Give it a try if you have the confidence for it.\nAnd if you have what it takes.
Now, I've seen what you can do, <avatar_name>.
But there's something I want to be sure of.
I want to see if you can shoot at me\nand do "that."
Come on!
I knew it...
Let's do this again sometime.
I'll win next time. Until then.
(I am Carlos Bara.\nWinning is my reason for being.)
(But...)
(The other part of me...)







Grawr!
Łoł!
There!
That's it!
Get a load of this!
Go!
Press in!























Captain!
It's yours now!
I'm counting on you!
Go!
Here we go!
Idziemy!
We're on!
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!
Kazuo!
Nitta!
Jito!
Soda!
Ishizaki!
Schneider!
Muller!
Heine!
Pierre!
Napoleon!
Jean!
Kluivoort!
Hernandez!
Rusciano!
Robson!
Carlos!
Alberto!
Keizinho!
Diaz!
Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
I did it!
Yeah, I can do that, too!
I did it, everyone!
You practice hard, this is what you get.
Yes! That's how it's done!
I don't lack the hunger.
You didn't blink, did you?
Yes! All caught up!
Let's leave 'em in the dust!
Yes! Let's keep this up and pull ahead!
Don't count us out! We're still tied!
Don't lose focus!
Don't give up just yet!
Beleza! What a play!
Stellar!
Bacana! Very nice!
Oh boy...!
What is...?!
S-Stop them!
Sweet pass!
Got it!
You can trust me.
On it!
Ei!
Here!
Over here!
Pass!
I'm going in!
Watch this!
Now!
You need more than that to beat Carlos!
Urgh, Tsubasa! You're too good...
Is this all Japan's Fierce Tiger can do?
So strong! You're no ordinary player!
What do you think of that, Misaki?
Ugh, I need to get stronger!
I win this one, Matsuyama!
Is this the famous Matsuyama endurance?!
You did have some nice moves, Misugi!
Agh, you're too good, Misugi!
I'm just as driven as you, Schneider!
Urgh... is my strength not enough?
Don't underestimate me, Heine!
Ack, he got me!
You didn't think I could do it, Pierre!
Can I not win on my own?
This victory is mine, Napoleon!
No! I lost...
Don't take me lightly, Jean!
As expected from the Shield of France!
You saw that, right, Kluivoort?!
Kluivoort... So many smart plays!
I sure showed you, Rusciano!
I'm not sure what just happened!
Carlos Bara! Even if I win...
Carlos, you're more... You're really...
See? I can do it, too, Alberto!
That's Alberto for you!
Carlos is still more amazing, Diaz!
The genius of Argentina... I see.
I'm not losing to you, Pascal!
Ugh, I can't believe I'd lose to you!
Good technique won't save you, Senghor!
So that was Senghor being serious?
You thought too little of me, Ryan!
Why did he know everything I'd do?!
Show me something more, Blake!
Urgh, what ridiculous strength!
It's our destiny to win.
I'm on support. Just leave it to me.
(Hmm... I still feel like doing something...\nAnything.)
(Wait... is that <avatar_name>?)
(Wait... wasn't that guy on the Japanese team?)
Hey. You need something?
I came to see Brazil's training regimen.
I wanted to practice with you, Leo.
Really?
But too bad. Team practice is\nalready over for the day.
I know! If you have a little extra time,\nhow about we practice together?
Perfect timing! I was just thinking\nabout doing some training on my own!
Let's do it together then!
Okay, this is a good spot!
You like soccer, right <avatar_name>?\nYou have the look of a guy who just loves\nkicking the ball around.
You just like kicking the ball around, right?\nGood attitude.
Stop by again some time!
So how 'bout that pass, Carlos?
Do it faster.\nYou left the receiver open to a tackle.
Got it.
You came to see me again, <avatar_name>?
Sorry, but I'm training with Carlos now.
Can I join in?
Roger that. I'll come again later.
No, I'll train by myself. You train with Leo.
No need. I'll train by myself. You train with Leo.
(Carlos...)
Carlos wasn't always like that.\nWhen we were in the same club, he was always so\ncheerful and loved soccer so much.
But things changed, and now he hides\nhis emotions and focuses only on winning.
...
Oops, sorry about that.\nAnyway, let's get to practicing!
Wow <avatar_name>, you've gotten\na lot better since last time, haven't you?
But I'm not gonna get left in the dust!
<avatar_name>...
It's almost time for the meeting.\nShouldn't you return to the dorm?
Oh, it's that late? Let's call it for today.
Stop by again whenever\nyou have time, <avatar_name>!
(He really seems to love soccer.\nI'm so jealous...)
(I wish I could enjoy it that way again, too...\nWith Carlos...)
I saw your last game, <avatar_name>!\nYou did great!
You're getting better at a crazy astronomical\nrate! Keep this up and you'll blow everyone away!
Okay, let's train our hearts out!
Don't you think I've improved, too, <avatar_name>?\nI did my best to make sure I kept up with you!
And after playing you again,\nI'm reminded of us training together all over.
You really love soccer!
I mean, maybe in order for us to win,\nthe way Carlos plays now is unavoidable.
But when I play with you, I'm sure of one thing:\nthe reason people love soccer is because it's fun!
Like I said before, some stuff happened,\nand Carlos changed, but I'm going to fix it.
And then we can have fun together again,\njust like we used to!
Good luck!
I wanna hear about the old Carlos.
Thanks, man!
This is just me, but the way he used to play\nwas way more fun to watch than he is now.
You'll see it, too, someday. I guarantee it!
We're definitely making it to the finals,\n<avatar_name>. So you need to keep at it\nand push through, too.
Then we can meet up in the finals\nand have the best match ever!
I really wish we could've played each other,\nbut... Brazil lost. It's a real shame.
Well, crying about it's not gonna change\nanything. All I can do now is cheer you on with\nthe remainder of my vocal cords!
Win the finals and take home that championship!
Next up is the finals... It's finally our match.
Just like you guys have got Tsubasa,\nwe've got Carlos.
And as his partner, I'll give him everything\nhe needs to play his best. And we'll conquer!
It may be a serious match, <avatar_name>,\nbut let's both make the most of this!
Hey Lucas, what's that race you're watching?
It's a track and field relay.
Oh yeah, you used to do track, didn't you Lucas?
Yeah. Man these relays get me revved!
Passing the baton is way more\nthan just passing a stick.
It's like passing on your desire to win,\nor cheering on your teammates.\nAll of that sucks up into the baton.
And then the runner who receives it takes\non the feelings of the guy before him,\nand because of that can run even harder!
Yes, exactly!
Isn't that all in your head?
You get it!
What, you don't get it...?
You'll never be a good sprinter\nif you're that dense!
I was talking about this with Lucas earlier,\nbut I think a pass in soccer is a lot\nlike a baton pass in a relay.
I'm a forward on my team, and when I receive\na pass I can tell that my teammates want me\nto score for them.
And knowing that really hypes me up,\nletting me play harder and get it done.
When you pass, <avatar_name>, remember that\nit isn't just about getting the ball\nto your teammate.
Put your heart into it, so the ball can carry\nyour ambition and give your teammate a boost.







Haaah!
Ohh!
You're wide open!
You're mine!
Here we go!
Crush 'em!
Come on! Come on!























Captain!
You're up!
Don't let us down!
Heading your way!
With me!
You with me?
Go time!
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!
Kazuo!
Nitta!
Jito!
Soda!
Ishizaki!
Schneider!
Muller!
Heine!
Pierre!
Napoleon!
Jean!
Kluivoort!
Hernandez!
Rusciano!
Robson!
Carlos!
Leo!
Keizinho!
Diaz!
Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
Protect but also score. That's my goal!
I go all in if there's hope of scoring!
Yes!
This is what I do!
I got it, you guys!
My shots are pro!
Everyone, with me!
Don't let up now! We're only tied!
No need to let up on 'em!
Turn up the heat!
We'll zoom past them soon enough!
Stay alert!
Not yet! Do not give up yet!
That's the kind of play we need!
Glorious!
There you go!
No, no, no!
Eh...?!
That's as far as they go!
Anyone else see that pass?
Kay!
You know I've got this!
My turn!
C'mon!
Here!
Bola!
Pass!
It's all or nothing!
You know what to do!
Remember how we practiced!
Watch me!
Blegh.
Fire it up!
Godlike kick incoming!
Another goal in the bag!
This shot is gonna shine!
You won't sneak past me!
That's not happening!
Not one more step!
Push!
Classic Carlos!
Nicely done!
You gotta play smarter, Tsubasa!
Can't wait 'til our next game, Tsubasa!
Fierce Tiger, Hyuga? More like a pet cat!
So, this is the power of the Fierce Tiger!
That won't work on me, Misaki!
French-style, huh? It works!
Heh. This one's mine, Matsuyama!
Urgh, you win this time, Matsuyama!
What happened, Misugi? So sluggish!
Aiming to surpass me, Misugi?
Schneider, this is South American level!
Germany's Young Emperor in the flesh!
I'll beat you no matter what, Heine!
Gah! Why can't I beat you?!
Pride of the Kingdom of Soccer my butt!
Pierre, you're one to watch.
That's futile against me, Napoleon!
Gah, the ball isn't a weapon, Napoleon!
You're one guy I won't lose to, Jean!
You gotta tell me how you got so agile!
Don't tell me that's it, Kluivoort!
Wah, my head's still spinning!
A fantasista isn't unstoppable!
This is Rusciano's soccer?
What was that about, Carlos?!
Next time will be different, Carlos!
You've got some work ahead of you, Leo!
Looks like I've got some training to do!
Diaz, I'll lose to anyone else but you!
You weren't jokin' about your skills.
Being timid costs you, Senghor!
Nice technique, Senghor!
No such thing as a perfect player!
You read my every move?!
You can't just rely on force, Blake!
I didn't think I could be overpowered!
Offense and defense go hand in hand!
Time to show off our unity and teamwork!
My versatility is what gives me my edge!
Alberto, can we talk about\nthe defensive positioning?
Sure, let's go over it.
Alberto, can we double check\nthe timing on our combo attack?
Sure thing!
Are you by yourself, Carlos? Do you have a sec?
Alberto...? Alright.
Do you have a minute?
You seem like a helpful guy.
...? You're... one of the Japanese players, right?
...? You're... one of the Japanese players, right?
Do you need something?\nI don't mind helping out, if I can.
Hey, Alberto! About what we were talking about...
I'd love to hear you out,\nbut I'm a little busy right now.
Sorry. Stop by again sometime. Catchya later.
What are you doing?! Do you really think we\ncan take on the best in the world with that?!
We're from País do Futebol!\nWe can't afford to let down everyone back home!
Put more spirit into it!\nYou hafta treat practice like it's the real thing!
Uh... Okay!
We're not going to be satisfied with this,\nare we?! We came here to win this whole thing,\ndidn't we?!
Aren't you frustrated after that disgrace?\nWhy aren't you putting that frustration to use\nin practice?!
I'm adding ten more sets!\nI'll show you how it's done!
...
Ah! Carlos!
He's right... We've gotta put in more\neffort in. Okay, let's make this work!
Y-Yeah, for sure. Zróbmy to!
*pant* *pant*
Phew... <avatar_name>? What brings you here?
You were a real drill sergeant, today.
You're still not done with training?
Wait... You saw the whole thing?
Sometimes people need a little push.
Even Brazil needs to put in the effort\nif we want to take on the world.
As soon as the tournament began, I'd a gut feeling\nthat every team would be steadily improving.
It's no big deal. If I complained about something\nso trivial, I'd be laughed right off the team.
I was harsh on them today...\nSo I have to be harsh on myself, too.
Seems pretty obvious to me.\nNo one would follow a captain who's all talk.
So, care to join me? It'll be tough,\nbut it'll be worth it.
Idziemy!
Wow... I'm surprised you could keep up.
Łoł! You've gotten a lot better!\nYou kick like a donkey!
All that's left to work on is\nyour state of mind when taking a shot.
It's important to believe in yourself.\nYou gotta know "this one's going to make it!"
I'm a defender, so shots I take\nare generally from far out.
If I do it halfhearted, then I might as well be\nhanding my opponent the ball on a silver platter.
On the other hand, confidence lets you\ngive it 120%. The right mindset can hold\nmysterious providence.
If you think I'm lying, then try asking your\nteammates. I'm sure someone will think\nthe same way.
I taught you the trick to this shot,\nbut whether you can master it or not\ndepends on your mental fortitude.
Well, after seeing you play, I'm sure\nyou'll figure it out sooner or later.
I've got my eye on you. You'll go far.
Who knows, you might even master my defense, too.\nYou can use it as reference, if you like.
Feel free to drop by whenever you want.\nYou're always welcome.
Okay, this'll be our final drill for the day!
Alright, let's go crazy!
<avatar_name>? What is it?
Something's wrong with that player.
Look at him. Notice anything?
Who...? Lucas?
Now that you mention it...\nI'll try talking to him.
What?
Oh, now that you mention it... Lucas's\nmovements are a little off. I'll talk to him.
Lucas, you've got to speak up\nif you're feeling beat.
How could I possibly take a break\nwhen you're working so hard, Alberto?
Come on, we've got an important match coming up,\ndon't we? We need you in at midfield.\nNo way I'm risking you getting injured.
We need you supporting our frontlines, right?\nWe need you both "use" and "ful."
You hafta take better care of yourself.
Yeah... My bad. Sorry for making ya worry.
Anyway, I hear you. I'll make sure\nto grab a breather when I need one.
Thanks, <avatar_name>.\nApparently his leg was feeling a little off.
Jeez, some leader I am. I didn't even realize my\nteammate was injured until you pointed it out.\nI can't believe I'm so blind...
You really got a sharp eye.\nYou'd make a good captain!
Come to think of it, I saw your recent game.\nYou did pretty well out there.
Plus you mastered that shot I taught\nyou way faster than I expected...
You're just full of surprises, aren't you?\nWith these matchups,\nBrazil is bound to meet Japan in the finals...
As captain, I've got a responsibility to lead us\nto victory. So I expect to see Japan in the\nfinals, too! They'll sing songs of our glory!
It's a really a shame we couldn't play each other\nin the tournament. Brazil versus Japan would\ndefinitely have been one for the history books.
That's on us though. We weren't good enough...\nWe'll learn from our mistakes though,\nyou can count on that.
But you've still got a chance to do something\nto knock the world's socks off. Don't waste it.
I'll be keeping my eyes peeled.
You're just full of surprises, aren't you? Keep\nthat up and we'll have some fun in the semifinals.
Let's both give it everything we've got and\ngive this tournament a game people will talk about\nfor years to come!
Okay, Carlos is marked!\nI'll cut off Leo down the middle!
Gah...
Ugh, it's no good! I can't get a pass to Carlos!
Over here, Leo!
Okay, it's up to you Alberto!
Suck on this!
Wait... Oh, no!
Awesome! You da man, Alberto!
All thanks to that bombin' pass, Leo.
Alright, today went great!
Watching us practice again, <avatar_name>?\nYou really are dedicated.
That was an amazing long shot.
A defender? Shooting?
Thanks, man.
I may be a defender, but if I've got a shot,\nI'll take it.\nIt's important to always be looking up the field.
Sounds like your thinking is stuck on position.\nIf a defender's got a shot, they need to take it.
I could teach you a trick, if you like.
Come on, don't be shy. We're all fellow players\nhere. Isn't that what's so great about this\ntournament?
Besides, if I can help raise the level of soccer\nplayed worldwide, that just makes everything more\nfun. What's the point in hoarding technique?
But since I'm going out of my way to teach you,\nyou'd better master it for me. Don't let me down!
Okay, let's get started!
Łoł! You've gotten a lot better!\nYour shots are a lot stronger now!
All that's left to work on is\nyour state of mind when taking a shot.
It's important to go in with\nstrong feelings like "I got this one!"
I'm a defender, so shots I take\nare generally from far out.
If I do it halfhearted, then I might as well be\nhanding my opponent the ball with a love letter\nattached.
Alternatively, confidence and heart\nlet you give it 120%. You get in the zone,\nand you get the job done.
If you think I'm lying, then try asking your\nteammates. I'm sure someone will think\nthe same way.
I taught you the shot, but whether or not\nyou can use it depends on your mental toughness.\nI wish you all the best.
C'mon! Can't you guys keep up with this rhythm?!
Hah, I ain't falling behind!
Just watch my sick moves!
Remember this!
Hey, don't just sit there, Carlos!\nGet your groove on!
No, thank you.
You're such a buzzkill, man.
Forget it, Keizinho! No use in forcing him if\nhe doesn't want to. We can have fun without him!
Ha ha! Very nice, guys!
Oh hey, <avatar_name>. Wanna join us?
This is a pitch. What're you doing?
Looks like fun!
What does it look like? Dancing! We're taking a\nbreak from practice, so I thought it might be\nfun...
Yup! We're taking a break from practice, so I\nfigured we could party and enjoy ourselves a bit.\nAnd what do ya know? The team was on board!
I'm glad everyone's having fun. It'd be\nsuffocating to just practice day in day out.
Besides, it's not like it's a waste of time.
Fostering camaraderie and building together as a\nteam both come across on the field.
Brazilian soccer is known for getting a little\nhyped up and out of control, so it's not like this\nis so far outside the norm.
If you think I'm crazy, then try joining in!\nYou'll understand quick!
Hey Alberto, Carlos doesn't want to practice\ntogether. Can you talk to him for me?
Ugh... I suppose. Fine, fine.
Fine... If you insist, Alberto.\nI just have to be his training partner, right?
Yeah. Thanks, Carlos.
Guess even Carlos listens when\nit's Alberto doing the talking.
Leo! Why won't you pass to me?!\nI was obviously the most open!
But there was a better place to pass it!\nIt worked, didn't it?
Cut it out you two! I can see where you're coming\nfrom, but arguing isn't going to help anyone!
Lucas. You were definitely open.
But from where I was standing in the back,\nLeo made the right choice.\nAnd the results prove it.
Ugh...
I know you want to prove yourself, but try to\nthink about the team. We're all representing\nBrazil, aren't we? We're in this together.
Yeah, my bad. I just lost my temper.
You too, Leo. No matter how right you think you\nare, you won't settle it by being a jerk to him\nabout it.
You're right. Sorry. I wasn't thinking.
Okay, then let's get back to our scrim!
Whoa, sorry! I can't believe I let a chance\nlike that go after being such a loudmouth!
It's fine, don't let it get to you!\nJust keep your cool and create more opportunities!
Alberto...
Believe in me and sally forth, guys!\nWe'll build up our offense gradually!
You don't need to worry about\ndefense as long as I'm here!
Alright! Good luck, Alberto!
We're counting on you!
Hey, don't forget me!
How do you see Alberto, <avatar_name>?
He's an amazing captain.
He's running himself ragged.
Keeping an eye on every little detail while\nholding it all together is a heavy responsibility.
He's already got the sense\nof duty he'll need as an adult.
That's true, he must be exhausted.\nBut he's not one to run from his responsibilities.\nIf anything, he's holding the team together.
The future of Brazilian soccer is a heavy burden\nfor anyone to bear. And he's taken on the role of\nbringing all these strong personalities together.
No doubt it's thanks to his solid foundation that\nas a captain the other players can play to their\nstrengths.
Was he born with the qualities of a leader,\nor did his position mold him into one...?
I'm not telling you to imitate him, <avatar_name>.\nBut I want you to remember him.\nRemember how he carries himself and the team.
Because someday I think it would be a blessing for\nyou to help bear the future of Japanese soccer,\nas well. I have high hopes for you...
You're just as good as I thought, <avatar_name>.\nFirst of all, congratulations.
Now, do you remember what we talked about the\nother night? Now that there are no opponents or\nallies, it's the perfect time to test this out.
I'm sure we can master this shot, together.
Let's go, <avatar_name>!
I take back what I said before...\nYou're way better than I thought.
I'd love it if you could come to Brazil.
Why? Isn't it obvious?
I love playing soccer with you.
Well, it's just one option for your future.\nGive it some thought.
Alright, see you later. Take care.

Alright!
Hey, my shots are pretty good!
Were you watching, Grandpappy?
This keeper can stop 'em and score 'em!
I did it! I did it! I did it!
Scoring points is fun, too!
You see that, everyone?!
Alright, now get us in the lead!
They're not getting that one back!
It's not over yet! Zróbmy to!
Counting on you guys to get those goals!
Sorry! My bad! It won't happen again!
Not one more... Not another point!
Nice work!
Nice!
Looking good!
Oh no!
No way!
Stop them!
Nice pass!
Alright!
Leave it to me!
Here goes somethin'!
Here!
Over here!
Hey! Over here!
Pass!
I almost had to get serious for that!
That worked?!
My turn in the spotlight!
Nice shot, Tsubasa!
So you're the Tiger? Got some power!
Your shots are like art, Misaki!
Good effort, Matsuyama!
You've got some crazy skill, Misugi!
Wow! You guys are so imaginative!
You can do better than that, Nitta!
Almost made it, Soda!
The Young Emperor is easily routed!
You're so funny, Heine!
Can't shut me up that easily, Pierre!
That one had a nice spin, Napoleon!
You won't score a goal like that!
Let's up the ante, Rusciano!
Come at me for real next time, Carlos!
Not quite there yet, Leo!
I win, Alberto!
I love going up against you, Diaz!
The Black Panther, huh? Cool name!
A little more power would be nice!
I like your playstyle!
Even I could predict that one!
You can't just force it through, Blake!
I'm a goalie and a fantasista!
Ain't soccer if you're not having fun!
Alright! Now I'm getting fired up!
What's wrong, guys? Done so soon?
Soon? We've done plenty.
It's about time to head back. Later.
Aw... I wanted to block more shots.
Hmm?
Hey! You!
<avatar_name>! Wanna practice with me?!
You're one of the Japanese players, right?\nWanna come practice with me?!
Sure, let's do this!
My shots aren't exactly...
Cool, thanks!\nThen let's head down to the field already!
I like your confidence! This'll be fun!
Don't worry, you'll do fine!\nI've seen you in action!
And that makes thirty! Whew, thanks man!
I'm surprised you came along with so eagerly\nwhen I invited you out of nowhere.\nJapanese guys sure are polite!
Plus, your shots are, like, how do I put this...\nunique! I should know, after thirty of 'em!
But since you've been such a good sport,\nI really do feel I owe ya...
I know! Next time I'll help out\nwith YOUR training!
I mean, I'd love to catch more of your shots,\nand that way I won't be bothering you!
See you later, man! Thanks again!
Hey <avatar_name>, this weirdly\ncheerful guy is asking for you.
Said something about a promise?
<avatar_name>! I'm here, just like I said!
Now, let's get to training!\nI know we can get better together!
Sorry, but this is a bad time.
It's almost time for dinner, though...
Oh, I see. My bad. I was so excited to face your\nshots again that I didn't even think about the\ntime.
It's that late? Already?
My bad. I was so excited to catch your\nshots again that I just rushed over here.
C'mon, <avatar_name>.\nHe came all this way just to see you.
We'll come with you, so don't worry about missing\ndinner. Let's practice right up to sunset!
Really?! Thanks you guys!
Here we come!
Is that all?!
Whoa, not bad!
He's the Brazilian goalie after all!
Okay, we'll wrap this up with one last shot!\nYou're up, <avatar_name>!
Not gonna make this easy!
Ha ha! I love playing with you! Truly!
And I was right! Your shots do\nhave a special something to 'em!
Thanks, guys! That was awesome!
You, too! That was fun!
Now, go home get some food, Keizinho!
That's the plan! Thanks again!
We should hurry back, too.
Or else Jito and Takasugi won't\nleave anything for us!
Those two were so nice. Makes me feel\nkinda bad that I can't tell 'em apart.
I've heard that people from Japan have\nthat kinda demeanor... Nice to see it's true.
Guess I made some new soccer buddies.\nComing to see you today was so worth it!
See you later, then!
Come at me! One more time!
If you insist!
Thanks for hanging out with me on your day off.
<avatar_name> said he'd be training with you,\nso we figured we could tag along.
We're friends, right? All thanks to this guy!
I was just thinking the same thing! Never\nwould've met you two if not for <avatar_name>!
You're the best soccer buddy a guy could ask for!
You, too, Masao and Kazuo!
If you ever come to Brazil, I'll show you around!
Sounds great!
Oh! Masao, it's almost time\nfor practice with Jito.
Whoops, already?\nWe'll head back first, <avatar_name>.
Bye, Keizinho!
See you later!
I'm so glad I became friends with you guys.\nI've always wanted to talk to someone from Japan.
To tell ya the truth,\nmy great-grandpa is Japanese.
My actual name is Rodrigo Keizinho Kuze Salgado.
I got the name Keizinho from him.
So I've always felt a connection to Japan.\nThat's why I'm so happy I could meet you!
If I ever get the chance to visit Japan,\nhow about you three show me around?
Of course, you're always welcome.
Ever thought about studying abroad?
Awesome! First I'd wanna visit your hometown,\nthen we can go sightseeing!
Good idea! Maybe I'll do that\nwhen I get to high school!
Guess I'd better ask great-grandpa\nto teach me Japanese then!
But before that, we've still got this tournament.
If we both do well we'll get to\nmeet in the finals! I can't wait!
Too bad we already lost. We won't get\nto play each other. But I'm wishing you luck!\nTake home the championship title!
I'll be cheering for you in the finals,\nso you'd better win!
But before that there's another\nbig event facing both of us.
We may be friends, but that doesn't mean\nI'm letting you win! Let's have a good game!
Anyway, later! I've got more practicing to do!\nHa ha, good luck!
Hey guys! The people from the dorm gave us\nthese snacks! Let's chill and have a nibble.
Alright!
Hey, no need to rush. There's plenty for everyone.
But look how many kinds there are. If I don't\ndig in first, then the stuff I like will vanish.
Ha ha, you're always so impatient\nwith stuff like this, Keizinho.
What can I say, I've got a lot of brothers\nback home. This sort of thing is always\na scramble for me.
The early bird gets the worm, right?\nMove first if you want to win.
Yeah, we call that pigging out...\nHey! We're already out of the one I wanted!
Heh... What'd I tell you? But since I'm\nso generous, I'll give you one of mine.
Tch. We let him get a monopoly.
Early. Bird. Gets. Worm. It's the same in sports!\nNext time you'd better join the race, Lucas!
Heh. You won't beat me.
We came all this way to watch them practice,\nbut they're just taking a break.
Did you see how Keizinho moved?
An early advantage is important.
Good point.\nWe could learn a lot from that initiative.
Wow, everything impresses you, huh?\nTo be honest, that observational side\nof you is what impresses me.
Anyway, after watching them, now I'm hungry, too.\nShould we go grab a bite?
I think we're pretty close to where\nthey sell food. I'll race you there!
Hoo! Ha!
Hey, <avatar_name>!
I'm practicing capoeira right now. Have you\nheard of it? It's a Brazilian martial art.
It's a traditional martial art with\na focus on how you swing your legs.
I'm do it because you need a lot of awareness of\nyour surroundings for it, just like in soccer.
If you've seen me play I think you'll understand.\nThe way I make saves is a little different, right?\nThat's my capoeira training in action!
It's a martial art, but it's deeply connected\nwith music, too. You can't really separate them.\nSo you can also enjoy it like it's dancing!
I know! I'll teach you some\nmoves so you can try it out!
Yeah, that's it! You're a natural!
So? Do you sense that vibe\nwhen you match up with the music?
I always feel the rhythm of capoeira,\neven when I'm playing soccer.
I feel like whenever you play perfectly on rhythm,\nyour next few plays will go better, too!
For me that's when balls come flying at me,\nbut m'sure you can use it on defense, too.
Seeing you in action, the rhythm might even\njust naturally come bubbling up mid-game!\nYou've got an instinct guiding you.
You're open!
Oh no you don't!
What?!
Nice save, Keizinho!
I'm on fire right!\nNot even Carlos is scoring today!
Now, it's time for our counterattack, guys!
Here we go!
I'll stop him!
What?!
Ha ha ha! Looks like I'm on fire, too!
Thanks to the blessings of the great Keizinho!
Great movement, everyone.\nMaybe Keizinho's excitement is contagious!
Sure seems like it.\nEveryone around him is so hyped!
Thanks, and you're welcome!\nBut we're just getting started!
I guess every team needs a mood maker like that.
Heh heh... Which makes me\na key part of the Japanese team!
Exactly. I have high hopes for you.
You need actual skill first, though.
Sure, you can count on me! Being cheerful\nand reckless is my thing! I fire everyone up!
Good point. I gotta do well in matches\nor there's no point, huh...?
Wait, no! I'm not THAT bad!
Okay! Let's set get the team energized, together!\nYou and me, buddy!







Ha!
Tak!
Here!
Now!
Eat this!
Press forward!
Go! Go! Go!

People of Argentina, were you watching?!
The title of World's Best belongs to me!
I could do this with my eyes closed!
Heh. Nothing's impossible for a genius!
This is a Juan Diaz play!
Of course, I pulled it off!
Let's roll with this momentum!
Heh, can't stop, won't stop!
Who's laughing now?! We're gonna win!
You think we're out? We've just started!
Don't look so grim. We've got this!
Giving up is not an option!
Awesome play!
Knockout!
There you go!
We're in trouble!
What?!
They can't get through!
Super pass!
Got it!
You know I can do it!
Time to go to work!
Hey!
Over here!
Hey, here!
Pass!
Okay, time to crack some eggs!
Observe a prodigy at work!
You think you can stop me?
Go!
Heh!
Watch and learn!
Drive Shot!
Here's my special move!
Drive Shot incoming!
Heh! Can you keep up?
Let the show begin!
Ready to witness my power?!
Drive in!
How d'ya like this!
Hyah!
I'm Juan Diaz: top player and genius!
Time for the main event!
See what I'm really about!
Surge!
Chow down on this!
Settled!
Here I go!
That's right!
Catch me if you can!
Twin Shot!
You did it, Pascal!
Yup, that's how we do!
You didn't stand a chance, Tsubasa!
I'll do right by my name next time!
You won't beat me relying on strength!
Gah, Hyuga! You're a beast!
My technique is superior, Misaki!
Y'got some promise, Misaki!
Matsuyama! I wouldn't lose to you!
Matsuyama! No... No way!
This isn't a fair fight for you, Misugi!
You're a genius, too, Misugi!
I'm the greatest, Schneider!
Well, well, Schneider! Y'got me!
Good technique, Heine. Mine's better!
Guau, I'm impressed, Heine!
Now you know how a genius plays, Pierre!
You're good, Pierre!
Quit it with the roughhousing, Napoleon!
Oye, you play too rough!
You wanna try me, Shield of France?!
Dammit... Jean!
Unremarkable, Kluivoort!
You got me this time, eh, Kluivoort?
That was a fun face off, Rusciano!
You're a bona fide fantasista!
There's no way I'd lose to you, Carlos!
Urgh, I swore I wouldn't lose to you!
Heh, I win this time, Pascal!
Urgh, you know your stuff, Pascal!
You have a ways to go, Galvan!
Galvan, why you... I was careless, okay?
You're not better than me, Victorino!
Didn't see that coming, Victorino!
That won't do, Senghor!
When did you get this good, Senghor?
Prodigies don't need stats, Ryan!
Okay, Ryan. You have... some talent.
Heh, Technique beats power!
What even are you, Blake?!
This is gonna be a fun game!
There's not a wall I can't get through!
Our generation may have two geniuses.
Our soccer is on very different levels.
Come on, guys, let's have fun with it!
Junior Youth World Challenge Finals Tournament,\nQuarterfinals,\nJapan vs. Argentina
Aaand there's the whistle!
After a desperate struggle all the way\nthrough overtime, Japan beats Argentina\nand moves on to the top four!
Hey! Number 10!
Diaz?
Your name. Tell me your name.
Tsubasa. Tsubasa Ozora.
Tsubasa, huh?
Yeah.
I'll remember it.
That night...
(In today's match, I did the best I could\nand ended up scoring all our goals.)
(Meanwhile, Tsubasa helped his team win by scoring\nwith his powerful Drive Shot and also passing to\nhis teammates so they could score.)
(As a midfielder and as his team's number 10,\nTsubasa was the one who did more work.)
(I wish I could say otherwise, but right now,\nhe's the better midfielder.)
(That said...)
(I should be able to do anything he can.)
(Then there's that other guy from Japan who often\nrolls around here. He's grown a lot. I should try\nand find the same level of dedication.)
(I'm going to keep learning to become an even\nbetter midfielder and an even better 10!)
Days later...
Okay boys, time for the practice match. Get ready!
Okay!
(Up until now, my playstyle as number 10 has always\nbeen that of using my teammates so I can score.)
(Passing to them so they can score when open\nnever even crossed my mind.)
(So, the first thing I have to do is develop\na sense for that.)
Hey, Pascal.
Hi, Diaz. Looks like we're on the same side again.
I'll send the ball your way near the goal,\nas usual. Shots are all yours!
I had something else in mind, actually.
Huh?
I want you up front today. I'll pass to you when\nwe reach the goal and then you score, okay?
Oh. Okay.
I know you can do it!
(Now, what was that about?)
...
(Could he be--?!)
(If that's what he wants to do, then as his\npartner, I'll help make it work.)
(I'm going to improve right alongside him!)
Good one, Pascal!
Well, your pass was perfect!\nYou put the ball exactly where I wanted it!
That's 'cause I know your playstyle like the back\nof my hand.
(By playing in a way that enables my teammates\nto score, I realized a couple things.)
(Until now, I mainly considered what my opponents\nwould do to try to stop me.)
(But if I'm going to try to use everyone,\nI'm going to need to expand my field of vision\nto look at a lot of players.)
(It won't be easy, but it'll be worth it!)
Hey, Diaz, I was thinking...
Yeah?
If I know you, I bet you can add some oomph to a\npass like Tsubasa does.
You mean give it some drive?
(Come to think of it, Tsubasa's pass flew right\nover Galvan to get to his teammate.)
True... A drive pass would be hard to intercept.\nMight be more effective.
Okay. I'll try working that in!
Cool.\nI'll be your target, so let's practice it later!
Great!
(Diaz's playstyle was totally different today.\nIs he maybe...)
Days later...
This is it!
Galvan! Incoming Drive Shot!\nStop it at the edge of the goal line!
You got it!
Here it comes!
Diaz, what was that?!\nYou let that one get away from you!
Did I really?
Sweet pass, Diaz!
What?!
Crud!
It wasn't a Drive Shot. It was a Drive Pass!
Way to go, Diaz! You got it down pat!
Well, it's the same as the shot in terms of\naiming it.
And you were way more impressive if you ask me.\nIt's no small feat connecting a pass that swoops\ndown like that into a direct shot.
Oh, that's because the pass came from you!
(As I thought. Diaz is working on a new style.)
(If that's the case, I know which team I should\nrequest for the practice game.)
The next day...
Our practice game being against Senegal was\ndecided real dang fast, wasn't it?
Eh, details. I wouldn't worry about it.
And it's not every day you get a chance to go up\nagainst an African team. I can't wait!
Pascal, about today's offense...
Say no more. I move down and then shoot off of\nyour passes... right?
That's exactly it.
I've got this.\nAs your partner, I'm gonna nail these!
Pascal...
I'm trusting you all the way!
Diaz.
Oh, what is it, Coach?
Senegal's number 10, Senghor, is highly skilled\nat bringing out the best in his teammates.\nSquare off with him and learn all you can.
What?
Stay with it, eh?
Coach...
(Looks like Coach figured out what Diaz was\nthinking, too.)
Let's make it a good one, Diaz.
Took the words right out of my mouth.
Like you told me before, let's play hard and\nhave fun!
I said that?
Oh? You don't remember?
...
Sorry, I don't recall.
I see...
...
Wait, I remember! He was under the tree when\nwe were scouting out Germany's scrimmage.
Yeah, I didn't have the chance to say hello\nat the time.
Oh were you there? Sorry I didn't notice.
It's all good.
I'll make sure you notice me in today's\nmatch, though.
I'm itching to get on the field.
Me too!
You need to lead us to victory today,\ntoo, Senghor.
We've been on a roll. Tell us to run, and we run.\nTell us to jump, and we jump.
Yeah. I'll make sure you all play to your\nfullest potential.
Looks like his entire team trusts him\nwithout question.
We're not all that different, Diaz.\nYou know you have our trust, too.
That's right. We're counting on you!
Of course. Leave it to me!
(The coach was so adamant about it.\nWe'll have to watch Senghor closely and test out\nthe Drive Pass.)
(Then we help Pascal score goals to secure the win\nfor the team.)
(There's a lot we need to do, but that's the strat\nfor today!)
Sweet! We won!
I know it's just a practice match,\nbut it still feels good to win.
Pascal! Way to put those shots deep in the net!
Your passes were too perfect!\nThink we're getting used to this style?
Maybe.\nThanks to you, I'm feeling a bit more confident.
Congratulations, Diaz.
Senghor...
You really are quite something else.\nI know you can score, yet you played to your\nteammates' strengths.
I'll take the compliment, but I'm still learning\na lot more about myself and the game.
I've got to learn how to control space,\ntime my passes, see the entire field,\nand know where everyone is. It's really a lot.
You too, huh? I totally understand.
In the middle of all that, I was watching your\nplaystyle like a hawk. I was impressed.
The way your teammates took your passes and worked\ntogether seemed so next level to me.
You think so? I mean, I'm happy to hear it\nand all...
Say, got any tips for drawing out your teammates'\npotential?
Tips, huh? I can't think of any at the moment.
Observe them, understand how they play, then give\ndirections, and pass the ball accordingly.\nThat's it.
But if there was the one thing I wanted you to\ntake home with you...
I'm listening.
Understand how your players are doing on\nthe day of.
Your teammates are still people. They won't\nperform the same day in and day out. If you know\nhow they're doing, you can adjust your passes.
So it's not just about space and timing, I have to\npay attention to their condition and play based on\nthat, too.
I wish my play could inspire my team the way yours\ndoes, but this is the only thing I can do.
So I figure, do what I can to the best of\nmy ability.
I see. You may be onto something there.
I'm glad we could meet on the field today.\nHope we can do it again sometime.
You bet. Next time in an official match!
I look forward to it!
(A midfielder that can make the most of his\nteam... It won't be easy, but to get to the top,\nI've got to do it.)
Next Day\nDuring Argentina Team Practice
Galeya! Zróbmy to!
Ready when you are!
(Pascal's sprint is faster than usual.\nHis legs are on fire!)
(Galeya's a bit sluggish today.\nHe won't be in position in time.)
(Ruggeri is... Palus is...)
What's gotten into Diaz?\nHe usually plays up front and enjoys practice.
He's definitely acting a bit strange.
Speaking of, his playstyle has changed quite a bit\nlately. I wonder what's up with that?
I guess it wouldn't hurt to ask him about it\nafter practice.
That's it for today!
Thank you very much!
Diaz, you got a sec?
Sure. What's up?
You haven't been your usual self lately.\nJust wondering if something was up.
Something happen? You feeling alright?
I'm totally fine. In fact, I'm doing great.
Well, what gives then? You were just staring at\neveryone during today's practice.
Oh, that? I was just trying to memorize how all of\nyou play. That'll help me to help you play better.
Help us?
I think I get it.\nThat's why you were playing the way you did.
But isn't that the exact opposite of how we've\nbeen playing so far? We were always trying to get\nyou to outperform yourself.
Why would you try something so drastically\ndifferent all of a sudden?
Well, you see...
I lost to Tsubasa as a midfielder, and in turn...\nArgentina lost to Japan.
Diaz!
I may have scored in that game, but Tsubasa scored\nAND helped his teammates score, too.\nThat made the difference.
So, I want to get better at bringing out\neveryone's potential as a midfielder.
And we will beat Japan the next time we play.
Ah. So that's what's going on.
...
Tsubasa is a talented player.
But I'm sure you'll surpass him.
If you're working toward helping us play better...
Then we'll work hard to make sure you succeed\nbeyond anything you can imagine!
I have the best team...
We got your back, Diaz, and we know you have ours.
This team won't be together for much longer,\nso let's achieve all we can while we can!
We'll be the next Junior Youth representatives!
If you want to help us become better players,\nI'm all for it.
You heard it guys! We're in it together.\nWe'll forge our own soccer playstyle!
Tak!
(I was wondering where everyone was. Now I know.)
A Few Days Later\nDuring Argentina Practice Match
It's all you now, Diaz!
I've got this!
(At least, I thought I did.\nThe defense is blocking all my passing lanes.)
(What am I going to do?)
(I know! I'll try "that.")
Galvan! Incoming!
You're dribbling in? I'll be on standby!
Psych!
He used a back step?! Man, that was smooth!
I'm charging in!
(Those two fell for it!\nNow, I just keep the ball...)
Ugh!
How does he still have the ball?!
(Now that I've drawn them in...)
(There he is!)
Pascal!
Nice one, Diaz!
Oh no!
This is the same maneuver used against us during\nthe Japan match!
That's right. It's a similar move to the one that\ngot us during overtime.
The play where Matsuyama hung onto the ball\nand delivered that counter...\nI still have bad dreams about that.
I'm sorry I was unable to steal the ball.\nReally, I am.
But we've got a playstyle that even\nscored a point against us. That's validating.
And I'm second to none when it comes to keeping\nthe ball.
So I thought it'd be a strategy we could\nuse ourselves.
It would feel so great to let Japan have a taste\nof their own medicine.
Why don't we come up with a few variations for\nattacking when you're moving the ball?
What a great idea!
The Drive Pass has proven reliable, but attacking\nup the sides could offer so many more patterns.
Yes! Let's try to come up with more plays where\nDiaz is in possession.
The defense isn't going to go easy on\nyou either, Diaz.
What fun would it be if they did?
Okay, everyone. Let's run it again!
Tak!
(They are really making an effort.)
(The team is still built around Diaz.\nThat hasn't changed. But Diaz's care for the\nteam has strengthened their teamwork.)
(And then there's...)
Now!
(That Diaz loves kicking the ball so much,\nbut he's taking the time to observe us instead.\nHe sure is trying to help us shine.)
Jeites!
(I'm not going to let him down!)
Pascal!
Pascal, one-two!
Roger!
Go, Pascal!
(I'm nervous but also happy that you trust me as\nyour partner to make this work with you.)
(I finally know how you felt taking those shots\non goal. It feels amazing!)
I won't miss!
Aw, yeah!
Nice shot, Pascal!
(His playstyle utilizes everyone on the pitch.)
(By playing this way, he's empowering the entire\nteam's offensive capabilities.)
(They're really putting their hearts into it.\nI want them to try this out in a match,\nbut the tourney ends in just a few days.)
(Is there even a team that would accept a request\nfor a practice match?)
(I shouldn't be this pessimistic when the boys are\nout there giving it their all.)
(I'll just have to cold call a number of teams.\nThe team's all in, so I have to be, too.)
Days later...
I honestly didn't think we'd have the chance to\nplay another team at this stage.
To top it off, it's the Netherlands!\nAren't they in the finals tomorrow?\nI'm amazed they agreed to this.
We'd like to sincerely thank you for accepting our\nsudden request for a practice match.
Don't mention it. We were also looking for a team\nto practice against.
This is such a rare opportunity for them to play\nagainst so many opponents. They need to soak up as\nmuch experience as they can.
Well, whatever the reason, we're grateful.
This is the perfect chance to test out the moves\nwe've been working on these past few days.
I will be the playmaker in today's match and draw\nout everyone's potential.
This will likely be the last match for the\nArgentina Junior Youth.\nLet's show them something new and win it!
Tak!
We... We won! Our new style worked!
We did it, Diaz!
The sweat and tears these past few days were\nworth it.
It always feels great when hard work pays off!
I didn't know Argentina played like this!
I heard Diaz was a one-man show, but that is the\nexact opposite of how they played today.
Practice match or not, I hate losing!
Listen up. I hope there was something you took\naway from today's match.
Kluivoort...
We should not be afraid to lose, but rather focus\non gaining experience and learning what we can.
In order to reach our next goal...
True. Though tough to swallow, today's loss\nprovided us with a precious lesson.\nWe'll be sure to utilize it.
You are too amazing Diaz. How could you improve\nso much as a midfielder in such a short time?!
You're exaggerating.\nMaybe I improved, but not THAT much.
And I didn't do it all on my own.
All of you and your strength pushed me to\nget better.
Thanks guys!
We should be thanking you!\nWe were able to grow so much because of you!
We might not be playing together much longer,\nbut we have our next goal in place.
And when the time comes, let's do it together.
Yeah, you bet. I'll be sure to make captain\nand help the team win when the time comes.
Listen up! We'll need to keep working hard\nif we're gonna keep up with this guy.
Tak!
(The Argentinian team came to America in hopes\nto win the JYWC, but we lost to Japan.)
(Rather than sulk and become discouraged, the team\nbanded together and developed a new playstyle.)
(And at the center of it all is Diaz.)
(He's a midfielder always ready with the game\nplan, and scores while helping others score.\nA captain the team trusts completely.)
(He has a lot more potential than I originally\ngave him credit for.)
(I'm excited to see all of you reach the next\nstage with Diaz leading.)
Yo, <avatar_name>!\nWhat're you darting your eyes for?
Wait, don't tell me you're looking for Diaz?\nSorry, but he's in the middle of something.
Oh, I remember you... <avatar_name>, right?\nThe Japanese player.
If you came to see Diaz, sorry, but he's in the\nmiddle of an interview.
Um... You seem familiar...
Oh, right, <avatar_name>.\nYou met with Diaz before, right?
I'm guessing you're here to seen him again, then?\nSorry, but he's in the middle of an interview.
He did well enough in the prelims to attract a lot\nof attention. Seems like it's not just reporters\nfrom Argentina.
Not that I'm complaining. I'm glad he's world\nfamous now.
We may have been jousted from the tournament, but\nreporters from all over the world want to talk to\nhim now.
I guess that's just how big of a splash he's made\nhere.
They especially want to talk about how he slipped\npast five guys in the prelims.
Wait, don't tell me you haven't heard the story?\nAbout how he dribbled past five guys and scored?
Well, if you haven't heard, you have now.\nI actually have a recording of it.
Preliminaries Block C, Argentina vs. Saudi Arabia
Pascal steals the ball! And immediately passes it\nto Diaz, who was waiting in the midfield!
It's all you now, Diaz!
Got it!
And Diaz charges headfirst into Saudi Arabia's\nintimidating defense!
Incredible! Absolutely incredible! With Diaz's\nskillful dribbling, he's leaving his opponents in\nthe dust one after another!
Unbelievable! Diaz just outplayed five people at\nonce! Now it's down to him and the goalie!
This one's mine!
You see that?!\nThis is what Juan Diaz is capable of!
Wh-What a play! What a player!\nFrom midfield to a goal, all on his own!
That's why they call him a prodigy, folks!\nAre we witnessing the beginnings of a legend?!
Back at home, they're comparing him to another\nlegendary player who did the same thing way back\nwhen. Calling him the second coming and all that.
It's just like the announcer said--this is the\nstuff of legends.
A legend... Awesome!
I'll have to become legendary.
Right?! I knew you'd get it!
But just admiring him doesn't get us anywhere.
You make it sound so easy. You can talk the talk,\nnow let's see if you can walk the walk.
First it's gotta be something people'll remember,\nlike what Diaz did.
Oh, <avatar_name>! Good to see you.
Hey Diaz. How'd the interviews go?
Man, it's exhausting.\nI mean, I'm happy they want to talk to me, but\nwhen it's just one after another...
It makes me want to shake it off by getting my\nbody moving! How about it?
You can come too, <avatar_name>.\nLet's practice together!
I'll show you all the tricks of a true prodigy!
Where'd the coach go? It's time to start practice.
Heard he's not back yet from\nwatching some other country practice.
Well, grumbling about it's not gonna change...
What? You need something?
I challenge you, Argentina number 10!
Are you the best in South America?
C'mon now, what's this all of a sudden?
But... sure, why not? I'll take you on.
Should always warm up before practice!
Nope, you got the wrong guy.
I'm the best on the planet!
Oh, I know. Since practice isn't starting,\nhow about I warm up by taking you on?
Now, try to steal the ball from me.
Bring it on!
Hey now! You'll never even\ntouch the ball like that!
(What the...?)
Sorry I'm late. Now let's start practice!
Sorry, <avatar_name>. Practice is starting.
Sorry, we'll have to leave it at that.\nPractice is starting.
He was no match for you, Diaz. You're unbeatable!
Pretty much.
(But that last tackle was a close one.\nHe even made me get serious.)
(He's not your average player...)
Oh, you're back?
This time I'll get you!
I just need to beat you, Diaz!
Ha! No one's challenged me time and again\nlike that since my days playing street soccer.
Ha! At least you're honest.\nKind of refreshing, really.
Fine, let's do this!
You're better than last time,\nbut you've still got a ways to go!
(Wh-What?!)
Gah, dangit!
(He improved this much over that short time?\nHe really is special!)
(Just as I thought!)
Fine... I see you. You're a fun opponent to face!
<avatar_name>! So you were training over here?
It's almost time for dinner! Don't be late!
Oh right. Japan's fielding two brothers, right?
But they look exactly the same. Identical twins?
Whoa... and both of them are reps.\nThat's pretty cool.
Actually, I'm the youngest of eight siblings.
My brothers taught me to play soccer, but with\nsuch a big family we couldn't even afford a ball.
So we used to kick around rocks or balls of\nfabric. I've been playing soccer on the street\nsince I was five.
That's where I met Pascal, too.\nWe would play together every day.
Our duo is the best. We've beaten\nwhole teams two-on-eleven. Amazing, right?
Well, the rumors must've spread. When I was\ntwelve, I got recruited by a local team.\nPascal and I joined the team together.
If I hadn't met Pascal, I never would've polished\nmy technique or my combo play, and likely those\nscouts never would've come.
Whoops, sorry about that.\nDidn't mean to be a jabber jaw.
Alright, one more match before dinner!
Okay <avatar_name>, give it a shot!
Gah...! Not bad, <avatar_name>!
Th-This guy's good...!
Nice, <avatar_name>! Not as good as me,\nbut still a great dribble!
But I can't get over how much better\nyou're getting over such a short time!\nYou might make a fine rival!
With that skill, you'd do\npretty well even in Argentina!
I've always wanted to play overseas.
I still have things to do in Japan.
I knew it!
Oh, really? Well, we all have our own lives.
I've always had plans of my own,\nbut for now I'm sticking with my current team.
It's because the club pays me a little money\nfor winning, and they tell me that next year\nI'll move up to one of the top teams.
Besides, once my brothers started working,\nthings've gotten way better at home. I'd just like\nto stick with my family a little longer, you know?
Hah, sorry to yammer on about myself.
Once I'm on a top team next year,\nI'll be able to really polish my skills.\nMy first goal is to be the best in Argentina.
Once I manage that, next up is best\nin South America and then... the world.
So you'd better make your way\nto the top quick, too, you hear?
I can't wait for the day\nwe get to face each other as pros!
Here I come, Galvan!
I'm ready for you, Diaz!
Wha...?!
I can't just charge straight at my opponents!
Oh hey, you're back.
You just thought that feint should be simple,\nas long as you can flip forward, didn't you?
But it's actually surprisingly tough.
I lightly kick the ball up before flipping\nforward, but I need to control exactly where\nit'll land, plus the timing.
And to do that, I need to read my opponent's\ncharge and the movements of the defense and\nall that.
So you need it all: brains, technique, and\nathletics. It's a pretty high level feint!
I don't mind teaching you, but can you manage?
Here goes, Diaz!
Bring it on, Pascal!
It's on!
Have a taste of my Diving Header!
Kidding!
Oh no!
Heh heh, you fell for it!
Yo. You're here too?
We heard Argentina was having their training\nin public, so we came to take a peek.
But Diaz's shot just now was out of this world.
Yeah, first there was that Diving Header feint,\nand then throwing off the goalie's timing with\nthat flip.
Plus, with the momentum of that roll, he added\na lot of power to his kick, which gave the ball\ntremendous spin. That'd be tough to stop.
Guess we aren't the only ones\ndoing aerial soccer, huh, Kazuo?
But no one's better at it than us, Masao!
I know, you're pretty athletic,\naren't you <avatar_name>? Why don't you try\npracticing that shot?
I'll give it a try!
Can I...?
Figured you'd say that.
Then let's get back and try it out already!
Don't worry, the way you move, you'll be fine!
We'll help out, too, so let's go give it a shot!
Hey, <avatar_name>.\nAre you interested in the Drive Shot?
What? You already know how to do it?
Then could you show me?
Whoa, that's really something.
But it's a little different from mine.
See, it's a long shot we use\npretty often back in South America.
But I tried to improve it by figuring out a way\nto use my ankle to make it a more compact,\nquicker shot.
I mean, you've had this happen, too, right?\nWhere your shot was a millisecond too late\nso the goalie managed to regain his footing...
But with my version, you can take the\nshot the moment you think "now's my chance!"
Well, why don't I just teach it to you,\nso you can try it out?
Whether you can actually pull it off\nin a game depends on your instincts, though!
This is it, guys!
Huh...?
*pant*
Sorry, but there's no way I can keep up with that.
Oops, my bad. I got carried away\nand went full steam.
(I'm a midfielder who creates the pace for\nthe game. Should I slow down a little so\neveryone can keep up?)
Just keep up that pace, Diaz.
Pascal...
Yeah, if we can't keep up that's our fault.\nYou're doing fine.
We may be a little behind, but we've always\ngot your back. Don't worry about us...\nFocus on the offense.
Plus, you expand our options when you break\nthe opponent's formation with your dribbling.
Our big picture strategy is\nonly possible thanks to you, Diaz.
We're counting on you!
Sure thing!
We'll show them next tournament!\nThe great prodigy, Juan Diaz,\nwill win the championship for Argentina!
Woohoo!
And we won't slack off, either!
That's how I'd lead a team!
A strategy based on a single prodigy...
Hey <avatar_name>! You need to get back here.\nWe're about to start lunch!
<avatar_name>! Get back here already,\nor we'll finish lunch without you!
It's time to see what you've got, <avatar_name>!
Ready, Galtoni?
Sure, bring it on!
Ha! Nailed it!
Whoa, that was awesome!\nI can't believe you could make that shot!
...
You're both amazing. I dunno when it started,\nbut you guys are in perfect sync now.
Well, with this guy at my side,\nI figured it was in the bag.
He's got a lot of talent!
Diaz...
Let's go practice together, Pascal.
Huh?
What're you acting so surprised for?
Haven't we always grown together?
Alright, let's do this! I'll start!
(Thank you, Diaz...)
C'mon Pascal, you're next!
Got it!
(I'm not going to fall behind!)
(I'm the one who forms\nthe ultimate duo with Diaz!)
Pascal...
Let's go, <avatar_name>!
Whoa, that's crazy!
You're completely keeping up with Diaz!
...
Not bad, <avatar_name>.\nNot many people can keep up with my speed.
I think you've got real talent!\nNot as much as me though.
Diaz...
Let's go practice together, Pascal.
Huh?
What're you acting so surprised for?
Haven't we always grown together?
C'mon, let's get started!
(Thank you, Diaz...)
What's the hold up, Pascal? Get over here!
Got it!
(He can keep up with Diaz's top speed,\nbut I... I can't even...!)
(I can't fall behind! I'm the one\nwho forms the ultimate duo with Diaz!)
Pascal...
Yo. You came, huh?
Sorry, but I don't have time\nto practice with you today.
How about you come to watch our team's practice\nmatch, instead. Maybe you'll learn something.
I'm feeling pretty good today. Zróbmy to!
Diaz never ceases to amaze.\nOnce he gets on a roll, no one can stop him.
You see that, <avatar_name>?!\nThat's the great prodigy Juan Diaz!
Can I play that well, too?
What's on your mind at those moments?
Hmm... Not sure. Probably...?
All I ever do is the\nfirst thing that comes to mind.
Like, how I'm going to get past the guy in front\nof me, or which shot I'm gonna take, I guess?\nNothing in particular, really.
That just shows how much\nfaith Diaz has in own abilities.
Coach...
To play soccer well, you need three things:\nimagination, athletics, and technique.
If you're missing any of those, that hesitation\nwill show up in your play and slow you down.
But you saw Diaz just now. Throughout that entire\nchain of plays, he just rode his own momentum,\nwithout doubting himself for a second.
That's because he knows his body will\nmove exactly how he imagines it will.
Hmm... I've never really thought about it,\nbut that sounds right to me.
Imagination, athletics, and technique...\nDiaz can readily combine all of them.\nThat dude was born to play soccer.
And from what I can tell, you have\nall those things, too, <avatar_name>.\nKeep it up, and you'll go far.
And if you keep putting in the effort, maybe your\ntalents will yield pro-level blossoms, someday.
You've impressed me, and not\nmany people can say that.
Yeah, I think you can handle this.\nYou've got good enough instincts.
It's my trademark overhead kick, where I take the\nmomentum from a cartwheel, and somersault, and a\nbackflip and focus it on a single point of impact.
But with all those acrobatics, the timing's\na little trickier than an ordinary overhead.\nIt's hard to squeeze in the cartwheel, you know?
So today I'll be teaching you how to work it in.
But in the end, it all comes down to playing it\nby feel. You'll have to make your own\nadjustments in practice.
Don't worry! If anyone can master this, it's you!
Listen up. You beat me. But I won't\nlose next time, or the time after that!
That reminds me. Our coach really likes you.\nHe was saying how much he wanted to bring you\nback to Argentina.
You can make my moves your own, and the coach\nsees your potential... You really are special.
In that case, I think I'll teach\nyou another new move, on the house!
This one's a shot where you use that overhead kick\nI taught you to bounce the ball into the goal.
And to do that, you need to read the opponent's\ndefense and look for where a hole's about to up,\nthen add the right spin for it to bounce in.
And to do that, you need to use my special\ndrive shot with the ankle trick to give the ball\nthat spin while you're hanging in midair.
The most important part is reading their defense,\nbut that really depends on the match and the\nopponents so there's not much I can tell you.
Well, if your instincts are as\ngood as mine, you'll figure it out!
Here goes, Diaz!
Bring it on, Pascal!
It's on!
Have a taste of my Diving Header!
Kidding!
Oh no!
Heh heh, you fell for it!
Yo. You're here too?
We heard Argentina was having their training\nin public, so we came to take a peek.
But Diaz's shot just now was out of this world.
Yeah, first there was that Diving Header feint,\nand then throwing off the goalie's timing with\nthat flip.
Plus, with the momentum of that roll, he added\na lot of power to his kick, which gave the ball\ntremendous spin. That'd be tough to stop.
Guess we aren't the only ones\ndoing aerial soccer, huh, Kazuo?
But no one's better at it than us, Masao!
Hey, <avatar_name>. Couldn't you have hit that shot\nif you had more explosive power?
I'll give that a try!
I'm not so sure about that...
Figured you'd say that.
Then let's get back and try it out already!
Don't worry, the way you move, you'll be fine!
We'll help out, too, so let's go give it a shot!







Tak!
Hey!
Here!
Now's my chance!
Here's one for ya!
Press in!
Go! Go! Go!























Captain!
You've got this!

Goal!
I don't just play support, you know!
I... I did it!
Nailed it!
Did you see that?!
Keep it together!
Good! We caught up!
Okay, now we just roll on over them!
Oh no, we're not about to lose this!
It's still a tie!
Don't let your guard down!
Don't you dare give up before it's over!
Guau, what a play!
Great!
Nice!
Oh no!
What is going on?!
Stop them in their tracks!
Lovely pass!
Got it!
I've got this!
I'm on it!
Hey!
I'm open!
Me!
Pass!
Don't mind me!
Just slipping through!
Openings everywhere!
Twin Shot!
Right on, Diaz!
We did it!
See, Tsubasa? I got skills, too!
Tsubasa, I guess I...
I won't lose, Hyuga!
What kind of strength is that, Hyuga?!
Misaki! There's no way I'll lose to you!
Ugh, am I... just like you?!
Diaz! This was for you!
I won't lose, Matsuyama!
That's Matsuyama!
Get wrecked, Misugi!
Misugi... I shouldn't be surprised.
Diaz is still better than you!
So, this is Germany's Young Emperor?!
Diaz's technique is way better, Heine!
Urgh, this is how Heine plays?!
You still can't touch Diaz, Pierre!
Darn it, Pierre!
I will not lose, Napoleon!
You don't mess around!
Pretty awesome, eh, Jean?!
France's Shield... I couldn't break it.
You have nothing on Diaz, Kluivoort!
This is Kluivoort?!
Not quite as good as Diaz, Rusciano!
Is this why they call you a fantasista?!
Diaz is way better than you, Carlos!
Gah! I'm sorry, Diaz!
You knew I would beat you, right, Leo?!
You're the last guy I wanted to lose to!
I've gotten better, haven't I, Diaz?
You put on your game face!
How was it, Galvan?!
Nice going, Galvan!
You'd be no match for Diaz, Senghor!
Urgh, you had some good techniques!
The world's best is Diaz! Not you, Ryan!
As I thought, on my own I...
What was that about power, Blake?!
Guau, how does anyone get that strong?!
Best not to think too much mid-match!
No worries. Just go with the flow!
No contest!
Are you... a Japanese player?
Oh I see, so you came to\nvisit someone on the team?
We're taking a break right now, so come on in.
You're Japanese, right...?
Uhh... <avatar_name>? I think?
Weren't you number 23? <avatar_name>?
So, what brings you here today? Came to see Diaz?
No, not Diaz.
I came to see you.
No? Hmm... Who then...?
...
Wait, you don't mean me, do you?
Me?!
Sorry, it's just we're always getting people who\nwant to meet Diaz. No one's ever come to see me.
Okay guys, break's over!\nLet's get back to practice!
Whoops, sorry. I've gotta go to practice.
But feel free to stop by again anytime!
Hey, you came back!
Well, I'd love to go kick a ball\naround, but it sounds like they're\ndoing field maintenance right now.
Oh, I know! How about we do\nsome laps around the stadium.
Oh hey, a pebble...
Heh, sorry, old habit.
I hear Japan's pretty well-off,\nso maybe you can't really picture this...
But as a kid I was poor, and even buying\na soccer ball was out of the question.
So we used to play soccer in the street\nwith whatever we could kick. Y'know,\npebbles, bottle caps, and stuff.
And then when I was five, I met Diaz.
You've heard of Juan Diaz, right?\nThe untouchable ace of Argentina?
Wow, it's already been ten years since then...
We really never did anything else. Diaz and I\njust played soccer in the streets, day after day.
And we were an invincible duo... even back then!
Ha!
Ow ow ow... Scraped my knee...
Heh. We used to fall down quite\na lot playing in the streets, too.
Let's go to the infirmary.
We should clean the cut.
Forget it. It's just a scratch. No big deal.
Ha! It's not that big a deal. It's just a scratch.
But you're a nicer guy than I thought.
Sorry... I guess that sounded a little rude.
Anyway, it's about time to head back.
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Whoa, that was crazy... It's about on par\nwith your combos with Diaz, if you ask me.
Heh, really?
I feel like I can really match up with\n<avatar_name>'s rhythm for whatever reason.
Okay, time for a break.
Y'know, it's thanks to Diaz that I even\nwas picked to rep Argentina like this.
When we were twelve, he got\npretty famous because the local\nsoccer club tried to recruit him.
But just him. Not me.
Diaz's family was pretty poor, too,\nand he'd always wanted to be a pro player.\nThere at the time, I was sure he'd say yes.
Were you happy?
Were you frustrated?
Of course, I was.
But to be honest... I felt a little lonely, too.
I was thinking that we wouldn't\nget to play together anymore.
Nah. I knew how good he was,\nso I figured it was only natural.
If I had to say though...\nI guess it was a little lonely.
I was thinking that we wouldn't\nget to play together anymore.
But this is what Diaz told the recruiter:
"Sure, if Pascal can come, too."
Not only that, he even said "If you don't like it,\nthen I'll just take another team's offer." He was\nbluffing... There weren't any other offers.
But his bluff worked, and I\nended up joining the team with him.
I polished my skills while on the team, and...\nWell, you know the rest.
Diaz is my friend, and I owe him a lot,\nso I want to be there for him.
I want to win this for Argentina, and to help him\nbecome recognized as the best player in the world.
We might come from different places,\n<avatar_name>, but I think of you as\na friend, too.
Still, don't expect any mercy in a match. When\nthe time comes, I'll be giving it all I've got!
But, well, we lost to you guys.\nStings a little, but that's how it goes.
We're going to beat you next time, of course,\nbut for now I'm fine with just cheering you on.
We may be from different places,\nbut you're still my friend! Good luck!
Ready... Set... Go!
Here I go!
So what was my time?
Hmm... No improvement from before.
I see...
Oh, you're here, <avatar_name>.
I was just doing some sprints.\nMy time's not getting any better though...
Diaz and I get called the Golden Duo,\nbut I can't keep up with him sometimes.
I want to be able to follow up\non all his plays though.
So I've been doing special training to work on my\nspeed, skills, judgment... pretty much everything.
But the running speed's especially been a\nproblem... There's no point in having the\nskills or judgment if I can't keep up.
Hey, Pascal. I found this video.\nWanna take a look?
Huh... "Sprinting tips from\ntrack and field athletes"?
Sounds good! Show me!
Can I watch, too?
Sounds interesting.
You're interested?
Oh, you want to watch, too?
I don't see why not. It's on the\ninternet, so it's no different from\nhim watching it later on his own.
I guess so... Sure, watch it with us!
Oh, I see... So that's the trick.
Pretty simple. Might as well try it out right now!
C'mon, let's test it out, <avatar_name>!
Ready, Galtoni?
Sure, bring it on!
Alright! We did it!
That was crazy... You two already work so well\ntogether! Can't believe you pulled off that shot!
(Oh... I can do combo moves like\nthat with all sorts of players.)
(And if they mark me for it,\nthat gives Diaz more room to breathe!)
What's wrong, Pascal?
Huh? Oh, nothing.
You just helped me realize something,\n<avatar_name>! Thanks!
Oh hey, you came.
Pascal's practicing with Diaz right now.
Here we go, Pascal!
Right on, Diaz!
Hey, Pascal... Have you gotten faster?
Heh, so you noticed? Figures you would.
You're probably going to get moved up into a\ntop team soon, Diaz. And in that environment,\nyou'll just keep getting better and better.
So I thought I had to step up\nmy game if I wanted to keep up.
...
I'll get into a top team soon, too! You'll see!
I don't care how good the other\nplayers are, our duo is invincible!
Pascal...
That goes without saying!\nWho else could be my partner?
Oh, were you here this whole time, <avatar_name>?
So you saw all that? I'm a bit embarrassed...
But you'll understand, someday.
It's essential to support your partner.







Woohoo!
Ho-yeah!
Here!
Get ready!
Gyah!
Forge ahead!
I've got one for ya!























Captain!
It's all you now!
Don't let us down!
Do it!
Let's do it!
Get some!
You with me?!
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!
Kazuo!
Nitta!
Jito!
Soda!
Ishizaki!
Schneider!
Muller!
Heine!
Pierre!
Napoleon!
Jean!
Kluivoort!
Hernandez!
Rusciano!
Robson!
Carlos!
Keizinho!
Diaz!
Pascal!
Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
This is my strength!
Tak! That's right!
That's what I'm talking about!
Heh, pretty hot shot, right?!
How about that? Demolished!
Ha! You saw that?!
How 'bout this one?
Now we're even!
Let's take this lead and run with it!
We are not gonna lose!
We're tied! No problem!
So what? We're still ahead!
Never surrender!
Great play!
Now we're talking!
That was phenomenal!
Not good!
What the...?!
Oh no they don't!
Boludo, what a pass!
Yes!
Leave it to me!
My turn!
Hey!
Let me have it!
Hey, here!
Pass it!
Think again!
I can't let you do that!
You're not getting past me!
Tsubasa! I'm not about to lose to you!
Tsubasa!
If it's power, I've got you beat, Hyuga!
Argh! This is the Tiger of Japan?!
I'm not gonna lose, Misaki!
Ugh, that did me in!
This one's for Diaz!
It's that Matsuyama perseverance!
You got nothin' on me, Misugi!
Misugi... I knew this might happen.
This is genuine skill, Schneider!
So, this is the fabled Schneider?!
You get carried away, Heine!
Here I thought he was all talk.
So much for the French General!
You just had to go and do that, Pierre!
Welcome to Waterloo, Napoleon!
Curse you, Napoleon!
It's brawn versus brawn, Jean!
You had more moxie than I thought, Jean!
Hey, Kluivoort! This is real gumption!
Kluivoort! When did you...?
What do you think of my power, Rusciano!
You cheeky little...
My fate is to conquer you, Carlos!
Brazil's ace, eh? Now I know.
Haha, how about that, Diaz?
Oof! That's Diaz!
I win this time, Pascal!
You weren't messing around!
Gahaha, what do you think, Senghor!
Senghor! That was some technique!
Did ya misread my power level, Ryan?!
Why you little...
I don't lose power match-ups, Blake!
Urgh, I got... overpowered?!
Like hell I'll let you through!
I'll crush you!
Okay, everyone! Practice is over for today!
Got it! So what do you think's for dinner today?
Don't know, don't care. I'm starving! Idziemy!
Wait, hold up!
You've got a guest, Galvan.
A guest? For me?
Fine... Who is it?
Oh, you're the one looking for me?
Sorry, but... Who are you again?
Oh, one of the Japanese players...?
Right, number 23. Correct...?
<avatar_name>, right?
So? You need something?
I want to practice with you!
I wanted to talk about weight training!
Jeez, talk about bad timing. We're\njust about to have dinner. Come\nback another time if ya want.
Just, uh, not at dinner time.
Well... I do love weight training. I'd\nlove to talk, but we're about to have dinner.
We also have evening training, so if you\nreally wanna talk, try again some other day.
Later.
Oh, hey. Sorry about last time.
Practice always make me hungry,\nso I got a little grumpy. My bad.
Oh, I know. I've got some time today, so how\nabout we go do a little lifting at the gym?
Phew, worked up a good sweat. Man, I love lifting.
But still, America sure went all out for this\nplace. Look at all these machines they've got!\nAnd even personal trainers!
Now to teach these muscles to soccer!
We need more than muscle though...
You know it!
We need what they call muscle memory, dude!\nAnd the only way to get it is to play for real.
Obviously, we're not done yet.
Now we've gotta put ourselves to the hazard! Play\nsome real soccer and build up that muscle memory.
Okay, let's head to the field\nand kick that ball around!
Huh... Not bad.
With all the training I've done since I came\nto America, I can tell that my special brand of\npower soccer has gotten even more formidable.
You should do more muscle\ntraining, too, <avatar_name>!
No matter what kind of soccer you play,\nyou'll always need a healthy body to do it!
Hey, <avatar_name>, you've gotten a lot\nstronger since we first met, haven't you?
I think it's time we compared our strengths.
Phew... Impressive. It's pretty amazing\nthat you're evenly matched with me.
Guess I need to step it up myself.\nI mean I can't just let ya beat me, can I?
I think we'll make excellent rivals!
You're really obsessed with strength...
How about working on your technique?
Yeah. I hafta be.\nI'm on the same team as Diaz, right?
Ha! Like I'd ever hold a candle to\nDiaz in technique... That's laughable.
Diaz is godlike in both speed and skill.\nNo one can beat him in those. No one.\nBut strength? THAT I can beat him in.
So I always make sure to take on the big guys\nwho wanna get a bit physical on the field.\nThat way I can provide openings for Diaz.
That's real teamwork!
So...
Whenever our match rolls around,\nyou're up against me, buddy!
Next time we play each other,\nyou're up against me, buddy!







Ha!
Oh!
Wahoo!
Now!
Gotcha!
C'mon!
GO!























Captain!
You're up!
You know what to do!
Have at it!
Here we go!
Let's rock it!
We're doing this!
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!
Kazuo!
Nitta!
Jito!
Soda!
Ishizaki!
Schneider!
Muller!
Heine!
Pierre!
Napoleon!
Jean!
Kluivoort!
Hernandez!
Rusciano!
Robson!
Carlos!
Keizinho!
Diaz!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
Wahoo! Did you see my goal?!
Wahoo! Yeah, baby!
We'll just score whatever goals we need!
Rah! I did it!
Just keep sending the ball my way!
We'll swipe it from you again and again!
Wahoo! Thanks for the easy points.
Let's push in and win this!
The points just keep comin'!
Tak! Keep this up and the game is ours!
Trust me! I'll get the lead back.
If they score a point, we score two!
You wanna win? Feed me the ball!
There's a good play!
Outstanding!
Yeah, that's it!
Aw, man!
What is this?!
We gotta stop them!
Now, that's a pass!
Wahoo!
I'll get it done!
Here I go!
Yo!
I'm open!
Come on! Here!
Pass! Pass!
Y'all have nothing on me!
I'll grant you a glimpse of my skill!
Wahoo! This is it, let's GO!
Wahoo!
Okay, here I go!
Just let me handle it!
Have a taste of this!
Panther Shot!
Devour, Panther Shot!
Too slow!
I'm too slick for you!
Yes!
You're the famous Tsubasa? Big deal.
This is the Tsubasa I heard about...
I won the battle of the beasts, Hyuga!
Ugh! I'll get you next time, Hyuga!
Wahoo! I don't lose, Misaki!
Dammit, Misaki you...!
Like I would lose to you, Matsuyama! Ha!
What?! You've got guts, Matsuyama!
You having trouble keeping up, Misugi?!
When did you learn to do that, Misugi?!
Schneider! Ya can't hold a candle to me!
I won't be backing down now, or ever!
You thought I was kidding, Heine?
Is this a joke to you, Heine?!
My technique is second to none, Pierre.
Tch, you don't mess around!
Just you settle down, Napoleon!
Tch, you looking for a fight, Napoleon?!
Me? Lose to you? Think again, Jean!
Jean! Darn it!
Wahoo! Try and catch me, Kluivoort!
Is that how it is, Kluivoort?!
Did you think that would work, Rusciano?
Rusciano! Pulling something like that...
You don't register on my radar, Robson!
Robson! Ugh, I let my guard down!
Aw, was that it, Carlos?!
Ugh! I'll get you next time, Carlos!
Wahoo! Took you down a peg, Diaz!
Hmph. Genius, schmenius! Bah!
Show some spirit, Senghor!
Guau, you've got some skill, Senghor!
Stop acting so superior, Ryan!
You think that was funny, Ryan?!
You lack finesse, Blake!
Jeez, Blake, hitting the gym, much?
I was waiting for this striker showdown!
Small fry like you could never stop me!
You dare belittle me?!
No... Impossible!
Upsets don't happen in sequence!
Man, that Victorino guy sure is one great forward.
Just watching him gets me all excited as a\ndefender. Makes me wonder how I'd stop him.
Man, that Victorino guy is a great forward.\nI can tell at a glance.
Just watching him gets me all excited as a\ndefender. Makes me wonder how I'd stop him.
Now's my chance!
Hahaha! I'm unstoppable!
Wahoo! Yeah, baby!
Sheesh, even in practice he's a one-man team.\nCharging in by himself, scoring by himself...
Huh, same as always. He plays even better when\nhe's riding high on success.
He's the type of player who gets fired up when\nhe's riding high on success.
But as a defender, I'm always thinking about how\nI'd stop a cocky ace like that.
His bold movements up his play speed, but the fact\nthat he doesn't make mistakes means he's got a lot\nof focus too.
So, when he gets like that, it's like nothing can\nstop him. It's a real pain.
But if anyone can stop him, it's me, the Ace\nKiller. It wouldn't be fun if it weren't a\nchallenge!
Oh, so one of your defenders said that?
Well, he's got a good eye. He's exactly right.
But... Why would you come all the way down here to\ntell me that?
I want to ride high on my own success.
I just thought your style was cool.
What am I supposed to say to that?\nI'm me, and you're you.
Hmm, but if you really wanna play like me...
Well, I can't deny a compliment.\nAfter all, my play style and my personality are\nbasically one and the same, right?
Oh, I know. If you wanna play like me...
You hafta run as if no one can stop you!
Sounds simple, but when you can honestly enjoy\njust running around the field, your body will\nrespond.
So, if you really admire my play style, keep that\nin mind.
I dunno if you're the same kinda guy as me, but\nwho knows? Maybe it'll help!
Hmm? Who're you?
I'm <avatar_name>.
I'm from the Japanese team.
<avatar_name>?
From Japan?
Oh, I remember now. Number 23, right?
Doesn't ring a bell.
Well, not like I mind you watching me practice.\nHeck, you can even copy me if you want.
Anyway, I'm busy. Later.
You're back? You gonna come here every day?
You really wanna practice with me that much?
I'm here to steal your moves!
I'll let you give me some tips.
Steal, huh? Heh, you're a funny guy.
Wha?!
Hmph. You're a funny guy. I think that's the\nfirst time someone's spoken to me that way.
...
(Well, if he's that passionate about it,\nmight as well keep him company for a bit.)
I was about to go practice on my own.\nYou can come if you want.
So what do you think? Pretty strong legs, huh?
Training on sand is tough, but\nit does wonders for certain muscle groups.
Plus, it gets boring training the same way\nin the same place every day, so I like to mix\nit up a little.
Still though... You guys are working pretty hard.\nYou surprised me.
No offense, but I was one of those guys\nwho never though you'd make it this far.
But come to think of it,\nI guess we were in the same boat.
Before the tournament, the favorites\nto win were like Germany and Brazil.\nNo one paid much attention to Uruguay.
That's why I'm gonna leave my mark on this\ntournament. Prove myself to the whole world.
We exist! They'll see us now! Uruguay, and the\nBlack Panther of South America, Ramon Victorino!
That's why I was gonna leave my mark\non this tournament. Show the world\nthat Uruguay and I exist...
Well, that was the plan anyway.\nBut we lost. I've failed.
But I won't give in. I'll keep polishing\nmy skills, and next time we'll be number one!
Yo, <avatar_name>. I saw your match.\nYou've gotten pretty good!
You're so quick... You got that from me, right?
Ha ha! Guess all that time you\nspent watching me practice paid off!
Still, it's pretty amazing you've come so far.
I mean, no one expected this back\nwhen the tournament started, right?
We certainly didn't.
Well, flukes happen.
I bet. At first I thought it was just a fluke...
But now I know better.
Don't say that, <avatar_name>.\nNever call your own efforts a fluke.
Plus, it's definitely not one.
If it were, you wouldn't have\nkept on winning like you have.
This is, without a doubt, pure skill.\nHave some confidence!
If we're going to play each other,\nI guess it'll be in the finals tournament.
And I can't wait!
Man, I really wish we could've played each other.
But... It's our own fault that we lost. Oh, well.
But we'll get another chance, as long as we both\nkeep getting chosen to represent our countries.
I don't know when that'll be,\nbut I'm already excited for it!
Oh, perfect timing. Wanna come\ntrain with me for a bit, <avatar_name>?
I need someone as good as you\nto get the most out of it.
Get ready, <avatar_name>!
Graaah!
Ngh... I knew you'd be a good challenge!
But I'm not done yet!
Thanks, man.
You really need someone your\nlevel or better to push if you wanna\nget better at one-on-one clashes.
I don't care what anyone else says, taking\ncontrol of a match is the job of an ace.
Especially, when a game comes down to showdown\nbetween aces. You can't win without 'em.
A good team can make plays following their ace,\nbut shut down the ace and you shut down the team.
But if they just work together...
That's why aces are amazing!
You're wrong, <avatar_name>!
Heh, sounds like you get it.
The job of an ace is to deal with the other\nteam's ace. And victory depends on their gumption!
Okay, let's do this one more time!\nBring it on, <avatar_name>!
You've got a pretty solid dash, <avatar_name>.
...
I know, how about we have a little race?\nI'll show you something cool.
Alright, here we go!
Wow, you can almost keep up with me now, huh?
But you've still got some work to do!
Surprised, <avatar_name>?
If y'put a little confidence in your legs,\nyou can often kick your speed up a notch.
You need the right mindset... Instead of being\nthe prey fleeing a predator, be the predator\ngoing in for a kill.
You seem pretty confident in your speed, so when\nyou train, try applying that way of thinking.







Haaah!
Here I go!
Gotcha!
That's it!
How's that?!
Tak!
Get in there!























Captain!
Up to you now!

I-I did it!
Even I can succeed when I try!
A shot's just like a pass to the goal!
I-I scored a goal!
Did I... overdo it?
I-It went in!
H-How about that!
Alright! We caught up!
Alright! Let's increase our lead!
We need to try even harder!
It's fine! We're still tied!
We're still winning, but stay focused!
We... We're still fine! We can do this!
Nice play!
Nice!
You're doing great!
Oh no!
What happened?
S-Stop them!
Great pass!
Heck yeah!
Trust me!
Idziemy!
C'mon!
Yo!
I'm open!
Kick it my way!
Let's do this, guys!
This is it, guys!
Think you can keep up?
I can do this!
Here we go!
Alright!
I can pull this off!
Knuckle Shot!
It's not much, but...!
This'll do it!
I WILL score!
I'll do it!
Arc Bridge Shot!
I can play on the world stage, too!
I'll win for my team!
Please make it!
You can do it!
I-I'll make it!
I'm not helpless!
You can't have the ball!
That's... mine!
N-Now's my chance!
I win, Tsubasa!
Y-You're good, Tsubasa...
I-I win, Hyuga!
You're so strong...
My technique's pretty good too, Misaki!
You're just too good, Misaki!
I win, Matsuyama!
But I worked so hard!
I win this time, Misugi!
Wow... So this is a Japanese prodigy...
I'm comin' for you, Sawada!
I won't lose next time, Sawada!
I... I beat Schneider?!
Figures...
I'm not half bad either, Heine!
Wow, you really are good, Heine!
I did it! I beat Pierre!
I knew you'd be good, Pierre!
I-I win, Napoleon!
I-I really can't stand violence...
Not even you can handle my technique!
That's the Shield of France for you...
Be ready, Kluivoort!
You're so quick, Kluivoort!
I'm just as good as you!
Y-You're so rough!
I... beat Carlos?!
What did I expect? Carlos is too good.
I don't care if you are a prodigy!
Wow, you can really move, Diaz!
My turn to win, Victorino!
No way I can keep up with that...
You've got room to improve, Diallo!
You've gotten good, Diallo!
I-I win, Ryan!
It's not working?!
T-Technique beats power any day!
I can't handle these power plays...
I always believe in my teammates!
I can't let everyone down!
I... I have to do this!
I'll do it!
I-I wanna win!
Senghor, over here!
Heading your way!
See how you like this!
Think again!
Ahhh...
Gah! That block was so fast...!
Hmm, in the first half most of my shots were\nblocked.
Sorry... Maybe my passes were too easy to read.
No, it's not that. My positioning and shots were\nthe problem. Your passes were perfect.
...
Second half is starting soon.
Okay! Counting on your passes again in the second\nhalf! Let's get scoring!
Yeah.
Senghor.
Y-Yes, Sir!
Listen to what I'm about to tell you,\nand keep it in mind this half.
O-Okay...
Senghor, this way!
...
Senghor!
(The opposing defender looked at me!)
Now!
Dang it!
Got it! Get ready!
We did it!
Nice going, Diallo!
Sweet pass, Senghor!
Thanks!
Alright. Keep it coming!
Heh.
Phew. We dominated on today's practice match.
Getting my shots blocked so much in the first half\nstressed me out, but there's nothing for it.\nI need to put it all out there this half.
Hey, Senghor, your passes had a different\nrhythm than usual in the second half.\nWere you trying something out?
A little, yeah. The coach gave me some advice.
Oh, yeah?
Come to think of it, I feel like lately the coach\nhas been watching each of us closer.
Yeah, now that you mention it...
Wish it would've always been that way...
Well, sure, but what can you do? We weren't\nshowing the same drive then that we are now.
Well, let's head back to the dorms. I'm starving.
Hey, <avatar_name>.\nWere you watching today's match?
You changed your passes\nin the second half.
What were you looking for passing in the second\nhalf?
I did. Not in a huge way, but it worked out well.
You got sharp eyes, spotting that while\nspectating.
I take it you saw that most of the forwards'\nshots were blocked in the first half.
Well, during halftime,\nthe coach gave me a piece of advice.
He said the reason we were getting blocked so much\nwas they figured out our pass-to-shot rhythm.
So, he told us to mix it up and pass when\nthe other player is looking at me.
And he was right, when I looked at the defense,\nthey kept looking back and forth between me and\nthe forwards.
So I did like coach said and kicked a long pass\nthe moment their eyes shifted to me.
I think their defense was looking at those moments\nas opportunities to cut off the pass.
They'd head toward the ball,\nleaving the forward open in the process.
But then... Well, not to toot my own horn,\nbut I hit an awesome pass,\nand they gave up on trying to intercept it.
But because they were paying attention to me and\nalready reacting to my pass, it took them longer\nto get back and deal with the forward.
And so, they weren't stopping our shots anymore,\neven though they shut us down all first half.\nCoach was right on the money.
At first, I was only thinking of making long\npasses that made it easy for players up front\nto shoot.
But what happened was the other team learned our\nrhythm, waited for the pass, and got in there to\nblock the shot.
So, by exaggerating my passes to draw them in,\nI got them to focus on me and the ball.
And when I was able to change it up\nand take advantage of their expectations,\nit turned the tables and gave us the initiative.
This is the strategic part of soccer.\nTo be honest, it takes some serious brainpower,\nbut that's its own kind of fun, too!
(Senghor, that was stupendous. He took my advice\nand executed perfectly without missing a beat.)
(I knew he had a high level of technical\nproficiency, but I must say I'm surprised\nby his soccer sense.)
(And now that I really look at them, I can see the\nunique qualities of all the players following his\nlead.)
(They may still be a little rough around the\nedges, but I have no doubt they're just as\nqualified as players from other countries.)
(I didn't see their individuality at first\nand tried to fit them into a mold.\nOur losing streak came from my lack of insight.)
(I'm resigning from the Soccer Association\nonce this tournament is over.)
(Then, I can travel the world, study how soccer\nis played in different places, and learn to be\na coach worthy of players like this.)
(Then one day...)
Umm, you're...
Oh, yeah! <avatar_name>, was it?
I'm Ismail Senghor. Nice to meet you.
You're <avatar_name>...\nNumber 23 from the Japanese team, right?
This is our first time talking like this, eh?\nLet me properly introduce myself.
I'm Ismail Senghor. Nice to meet you.
Anyway, what's up?
Just felt like practicing with you.
I want to see how other countries play.
With me?!
I-I guess there are a lot of countries\nrepresented here. It's as good a chance as any\nto experience different soccer cultures.
True, there are a lot of countries\ngathered here. It's as good a chance as any\nto experience different kinds of soccer.
Alright then. Let's practice together a bit!
You're so good, <avatar_name>.\nI can tell you think out all your moves.
I wonder if that's just how people play in Japan.
Senghor! How long are you goofing around for?\nHurry up and get the team together.\nPractice is starting soon.
Yessir!
And that's that.\nGuess we'll call it a day, then?
It was fun practicing with you, though!\nLet's do it again if you get a chance!
(I feel the same, though. Came all this way to\nthe International Tournament. Might as well learn\nabout the soccer in other countries.)
(Except I'm just thinking about it.\nHe's the one getting out there and doing things.)
(I should...)
(I should try to be more proactive.)
(Do like he did when he came to practice with me.\nTake that first step.)
(I want to play like he did during the\nJapanese match. Inspiring the others to\nplay harder and better.)
(If only I could be more like you,\n<avatar_name>!)
*yawn* I'm just not a morning person.\nYou sure are perky, though, <avatar_name>.
<avatar_name>!
Who's that?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Well, if it ain't Senegal's Senghor!\nWhat are you doing here?
Well, I thought I'd be the one to visit this\ntime. Is it okay if I practice with you?
Sure, join us!
What do you say, Ishizaki?
Tak! You came all this way.\nLet's kick the ball around a bit!
Ha! Why are you asking me? Like I'd say no!
Th-Thank you!
Your technique is great! I had this image of\nAfrican players that they all played pretty\nrough. You sure showed me!
However good my technique is, though, compared\nto the rest of my team, I can't run as fast\nor jump as high, and I'm not as strong.
You want too much, Senghor.
Look at Ishizaki!
What do you mean?
He's right. Your technique already lends itself\nto just about anything. Believe in yourself!
Th-Thank you!
Tak! I'm not the fastest or strongest,\nand I don't have the greatest technique,\nbut I make up for it with guts!
Hey, why are you making me say all this,\n<avatar_name>?!
Ha ha...
Thanks for today.
You don't have to thank us. We had a blast, too!\nCome again any time you want.
Okay!
Łoł! That was Senghor's move!
<avatar_name>, you're totally owning that move!
Alright, Ishizaki! Next one, s'you and me!
Oh, yeah? Bring it on, Senghor!
You've changed, Senghor.\nYou're more cheerful and outgoing than before.
R-Really?
Yeah, it's great! Keep it up!
You're a good guy, Ishizaki. Really intense...\nKinda like Diallo.
Actually, <avatar_name>, coming here to your\npractice, it was just me trying to be like you.
I, too, came to this tournament, in part,\nto experience soccer from other countries.
But then when the time came,\nI didn't have the courage to get out there.
That's why I was so surprised when you popped\ninto the Senegal practice area on your own.\nI was jealous of how outgoing you were.
I figured I can't stay like that. I have\nto muster the courage to be more proactive,\nand so, I came here.
If, like Ishizaki said, I really changed,\nI guess it was all worth it.
Don't stop now. Try other countries!
The only one who can change you is you!
Tak! There's a lot of countries playing.\nI should take the opportunity and visit\nas many as I can!
Yeah, you're right.
But you're the one who inspired me to do this.\nI'm really grateful. Thank you so much.
I'm so glad I met you, <avatar_name>!
You better put your back into it for these next\ncouple of matches. I wanna see you win them all!\nI'm cheering for you!
After all, you're my first soccer\nfriend from another country.
Shooting's not really my forte. I'm sure\nyou can probably find a lot of other people\nwith strong shots.
But I guess since you came to me\nspecifically, I'll show you what I've got.
For my shot, I don't put any spin on the ball.
Because the ball doesn't have any spin on it,\nit picks up a unique quality from wind resistance\nand the shot's trajectory becomes irregular.
The shot is so unpredictable even I don't know\nexactly where it's going, much less the goalie!
So, basically, if you're aiming at the goal,\nyou don't have to worry about controlling the\nshot too much. Just make sure there's no spin.
So yeah, this is my trick...
To make sure there's no spin on the ball.
The rest is all practice,\nand finding your own way of doing it.
Good luck! See ya!
Let's do this, Senghor!
You're on, Diallo!
Agh, nice going Senghor. As expected.
Oh, hey, <avatar_name>, you came.
What was that move just now?
You really thought out your defense.
Unfortunately, with my power, my tackles can't\nstop a fly, so I had to think of other methods.
Yeah, I put a lot of thought into the kind of\ndefense I could achieve and came up with this.
See, if I put my body between the ball and\nmy opponent's legs, they lose control of it.
Oh yeah! I should teach you the trick to it.
Diallo, can you help us out here?
Sure! Anything for you guys!
I guess if you're the one askin', Senghor.
Okay, now try it against Diallo!
Hey, <avatar_name>, Senegal is\npracticing right now. Let's go watch!
Diallo, here goes!
Łoł!
Dang it!
Sorry... the pass was too long, wasn't it?\nIt was gonna be hard to trap.
No, it's cool! We're practicing\nplays at full speed after all!
Overwhelming speed is our weapon. If we can\nmaster plays at this speed, we'll be able to\nbring our game up at least a notch or two.
Isn't that right, everybody?
YEAH!
Guys...
Keep dishing it out harder and faster, Senghor!\nWe'll keep up and make it work!
You're the only one who gets us moving like this!
You got it, then!
Alright, everyone, one more\ntime from the left side!
Tak!
That's awesome.
The Senegal team's got some serious speed,\nbut being able to call out plays that fast...\nSenghor's got skills.
The speed at which he analyzes the situation\nand makes calls... and the way his team trusts\nhim. There's a lot we can learn from him.
Because Senegal's a speed team,\na lot of our moves consist of getting\nbehind the opponent's defense.
So we do use a lot of long passes,\nbut if we use them too much,\nthe opponent will start to read them.
That's when we switch it up on them and use\na pass that's just a little longer than usual,\nand take advantage of a nice tailwind.
While you're here, let me show you.\nWith your talent, learning it will be no problem.
Hey, <avatar_name>, I was waiting for you.\nLet's practice like we planned!
Hey, Senghor. I was reading a soccer book they\nhave at the hotel but there's this one part\nI just can't figure out.
And the translator I have is speech-only,\nso can you help me out?
Oh, sure thing.
Can you waitasec, <avatar_name>?
Ah, so that's what that meant! Thanks a bunch!
Sorry for the wait. Shall we?
Senghor, we need you!\nCamara and Ahmed got into a fight!
What?! I'll be right there!
Hmm... I get what you're both trying to say.
This time, though, Camara,\nyou're in the wrong for starting it.
I... I guess you're right, Senghor.
I'm sorry, Ahmed.
No... I lost my head and said some\nthings I shouldn't've. I'm sorry, too.
Man... Again, sorry. Well then...
Senghor, it's almost time for practice.
What?! Already?
<avatar_name>, I'm so sorry! Gonna have to take\na rain check. I'll make it up to you, I promise!
Sorry, <avatar_name>... After you took\nthe trouble to come here and everything...
Sorry about today.\nAfter you came all this way and everything.
Everyone really trusts you, huh?
Don't they depend on you too much?
Yeah!\nThat guy's a really special part of the team.
You know, I can't really deny it.\nMaybe we really do.
He always works really hard\nto get the team to mesh.
But when we, as a team, see that effort, it\nreally does make us want to work well together.
In matches too, he always puts the team first\nand plays with us in mind.\nEverybody plays better and enjoys the game.
Sorry, that's probably not the sort of thing\nI should be saying to someone from another team.
In any case, Senghor's the\nbest captain we could ever have.
I really admire your technique, <avatar_name>.
With skills like that, you could\nlikely master the shot I developed.
The most important part of this shot\nis putting a double spin on the ball.
You have to be really careful\nto control the direction and force of the ball,\nas well as the force of the kick itself.
I'm going to teach you my way,\nso just practice that first.
If there's anything about it you don't get\njust let me know. I'm more than happy to help.
I hope this proves useful.







Haaah!
Aaah!
Here we go!
Right here!
Take this!

Let's gooo!

It's all on you now!
Counting on you!
I believe in you!

Alright!
Woo! I did it!
I live for this!
My goal is our goal!
Hehe, feels nice!
This is what I'm like when I'm serious!
Y'see that?!
We've got 'em right where we want 'em!
Let's keep this train a-rollin'!
We've come too far to lose now!
We've evened it up!
Don't get careless!
We won't give up!
Nice work!
Nice!
Good! Just like that!
Aw, man!
No way!
Stop them!
Nice pass!
Alright!
Y'know you can count on me!
All cards on the table!
Here!
Over here!
Hey! Over here!
Pass!
Eat this!
Łoł!
Here I go!
Vulture Shot!
The goal is my prey!
This one's mine!
I'm all in!
Here I come!
Try and stop me!
Victory's mine, Tsubasa!
Darn you, Tsubasa!
How'd you like that, Hyuga?!
A true tiger!
Did ya see that, Misaki?!
Wh-What incredible technique!
Eagles don't scare me, Matsuyama!
So this is Japan's Wild Eagle?!
Don't underestimate me, Misugi!
N-No surprise you're this good!
Let's play again, Sorimachi!
You've got guts, Sorimachi!
The empire's fallen, man!
Ugh, I won't lose next time!
See that, Heine?!
You're amazing, Heine...
You could learn a thing from Senghor!
Y-You've got skill, Pierre!
You picked a fight, and you got one!
Ugh, I'll be ready next time!
How's that, Jean?!
Oh, whoa! Jean!
Don't underestimate me, Kluivoort!
I'm not losin' next time!
You're nothing compared to Senghor!
Ugh, next time I'll be in your shoes!
Don't care if you are the Ace of Brazil!
Ugh, I won't lose next time!
I'm not scared of a prodigy!
So this is real talent... Crazy.
Did you clock that, Victorino?!
Gah, he got me!
I've improved as well, Senghor!
I knew you were one to watch, Senghor!
You can't calculate soccer, Ryan!
Aw, come on! Ryaaan!
I won't lose a contest of strength!
He's stronger than me?! Unbelievable!
It's not over yet! I can still run!
The ball is just another teammate!
I put my feet to the field for my team!
Believe in us!
Huh? Who're you?
Your jersey... Japan?
Oh, right! You're Japan's number 23!
So? What brings you here? Don't tell me\nyou want to challenge me to a match?
Ha! Course not, right?
You guessed it!
Just a normal, friendly challenge!
For real?!
Wh-Whoa! You're serious...?
Heh, well I guess I'll accept!
C'mon, let's hit the pitch!
You're pretty good...\nNot as good as Senghor, though.
Still, coming out of nowhere to challenge me...\nYou've got guts! I like you!
Hey, let's do this again when\nthere's more time! Promise!
Oh hey, you came like you promised, <avatar_name>!
I've been waiting for ya, y'know.\nLet's get this match started!
Jeez, you've gotten good quick! The\nother day we were step for step, but\ntoday you had me outmatched.
But I've seen your matches. You come off pretty\ncalm... You're really that sure of yourself?
You need bravado to play well.
N-No, not really.
Yeah, I think so too.\nHow else do you commit to a play?
Personally, I always go into a match certain\nthat I can't be matched in speed or jumping.
Really? That's a little hard to believe...
Waitasec... Are you the type who says you never\nstudy but gets good grades on all your tests?
Man, if only he had your confidence\nhe could be just as good as you!
Oh, sorry, I was talking about Senghor.\nYou know him, right?
Oh, sorry, I was talking about Senghor.\nHe's our captain.
I've been friends with him since we were kids,\nand he's always been really hard on himself.
It really bothers him that he's not as athletic\nas everyone else... Anyway, he lacks morale.
But if ya ask me, he shouldn't\nlet that slow him down.
I mean, he's so skilled the rest of us can't\neven compare! He's so good it's like we're\nplaying different sports.
So when we came to this tournament, I made a\ndecision. I'd boost his spirit by helping him\nmake some great plays.
If his technique works on international players,\nthen even Senghor has to build some confidence,\nright? And then he'd be even more amazing.
So I hope you're ready for when\nwe meet on the field, <avatar_name>.
You'll get to see first hand\njust what a great player he is.
Well, in the end we dropped out in the\npreliminaries. But he did seem to get a little\nboost of confidence from our match with you.
I know this sounds weird, but I owe you, man.
Whoops, didn't mean to yammer on\nso long. Let's face-off again!
Yo, <avatar_name>!
Y'know, after meeting up with you so many time,\nit's starting to feel like you're a teammate.
Oh right, Senghor seemed to get a little\nmorale boost from our match with you.
Maybe this sounds weird, but I owe you, man.
Also, it's a little late, but 'grats on\nmaking it through the preliminaries!
Oh right, 'grats on making it to the semifinals!\nI was cheering you on from the stands!
Oh right, I can't believe you made it to finals!\nThat's crazy, man! I was floored!
Of course, we did. It's me after all.
It's all thanks to my teammates.
Ha, there's that confidence I was\ntalking about. But you've earned it.
Still, I've played against you. You say that,\nbut you really trust your teammates, too!
Yup. After playing against you, I could tell.
Both you and your teammates\nreally trust each other.
But just like you've got the world's best allies,\nI've got someone I count on, too.
I mean, I've got my teammates, too,\nbut I meant... you.
Whether we're battling one another or just\nkicking the ball around, there's no one I'd\nrather hang out with.
So you're my greatest ally!
That's why I'm gonna be rooting for you!\nWin this thing!
And in the future, once we're both way better,\nlet's play each other in some future tournament!
Here I come, <avatar_name>!\nJust try and stop my dribble!
Heh, did you think we'd be going head-to-head?
I use a surprise burst of speed\nto slip past the guys waiting for me.
This is my special technique,\nwhich utilizes my raw speed!
Uh, Diallo? Isn't that more\nof a strategy than a technique?
W-Well, I guess you could call it that, too.
Anyway, it can't hurt to keep it in mind.\nThere are all sorts of approaches to dribbling.







Haaah!
Now!
There!
I see what you're doing!
Take that!
Now's the time!
Gooo!























Fine... It's the only way! Captain!
I have some great expectations.
Now go!
C'mon, go!
Follow my lead.
We'll go with a pass.
Do it.
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!
Kazuo!
Nitta!
Jito!
Soda!
Ishizaki!
Schneider!
Muller!
Heine!
Pierre!
Napoleon!
Jean!
Kluivoort!
Hernandez!
Rusciano!
Robson!
Carlos!
Keizinho!
Diaz!
Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Blake!
Azwan!
Heh. The obvious outcome.
Who do you think I am?
You couldn't stop me. I knew it.
Well, that's just how it goes.
All's well that ends well, I suppose.
Boring. Try a little harder next time.
This is the difference between us.
We're tied again!
No letting up!
Don't forget... We're still behind!
Tch. Guess I'll need to retake the lead.
Don't you dare give up any more points!
You're all useless! I'll do this myself!
Hmph. All thanks to me.
Huh. I guess you're not totally useless.
Keep it up.
I didn't see this comin'!
What now...?!
Stop them!
Very good!
Alright.
That's right... Leave it to me.
Idziemy!
Here!
Over here!
I'll handle it!
Pass!
Time to take control.
Finish this! Now!
You don't stand a chance!
I see you!
I see through everything!
I can read you like a book!
Now!
Let me show you your weakness!
We're going with this play!
I wonder how easy to read you'll be.
Do you understand?
Heh. My blood's on fire now!
Witness the Rabona Illusion!
Do you think you can stop me?!
I'll show you the supreme technique!
Hmph. You're full of openings!
Useless!
Now go!
You don't have permission to fail!
Here I come.
Now to just slip past you...
Now.
You'll never get past me.
You're pure inefficiency.
If I must... For victory!
Well, obviously.
No need to make a fuss.
You'll never win, Tsubasa!
High quality play... As I expected!
A tiger? Maybe a kitten.
Oh... A nice effort.
So you're helpless on your own?
His technique is better than mine?!
Tenacity is worthless, Matsuyama!
Tch. Persistent, aren't you?!
This is a prodigy? How disappointing.
Is this your real potential, Misugi...?
Get the difference, Takeshi?!
A player this good who's also my age?!
Even the Emperor bows to me!
You've surpassed my expectations!
You think too much of yourself, Heine.
How dare he make a fool of me!
Your plays may be flashy, but that's it!
Whoa, Pierre! That baffled me!
Napoleon, take your violence elsewhere.
Ugh, there was too much heat on that!
I've seen right through you, Jean!
I see. So this is the Shield of France!
Even duller than expected, Kluivoort!
Sharper than I imagined, Kluivoort!
Your imagination is... easily assessed.
Gah, I misread him?!
As predictable as a machine, Carlos!
Should've expected that of you, Carlos.
You do the kings of soccer a disservice!
The pride of kings of soccer? Boring!
Haha! A prodigy?! Ridiculous!
You've outdone my calculations, Diaz.
Black Panther is a cool alias and all...\nBut you're not really living up to the hype.
Oh? So you were hiding that talent?
You can't hope to beat me, Senghor!
Tch. It isn't like me to fail like this.
You really thought you could defeat me?!
Blake is... better than me?!
My side is the winning side!
Your odds of victory here are nil.
Remember, this is all thanks to me.
Everything's going according to plan.
When I speak, you obey!
Hey, <avatar_name>. Took you long enough.
I know we always practice alone,\nbut I brought a friend today.
Here I was thinking how unusual it is for Ryan to\nask me for a favor, and then it turns out to be\npracticing with you.
That said, Ryan's...\nWell, you know how it is with him.
So, what do you want me to do?
Simple. Block our shots.
But you have to be as serious as if this were\na regular match, otherwise there's no point.
Considering your skills, you should be a perfectly\ncapable training partner for <avatar_name>.
I can dig it. Let's get to it, then.
This'll be fun.
He's a goalkeeper in the youth category from\nCardinal Soccer School.
You wanted me to help you guys practice your\nshots, right?
Yup. But I want you to hold nothing back.\nNo sense in practicing otherwise.
Got it. Let's get on it, then.
Tch... Not a bad shot.
Okay, my turn.
Uh...?
Let me try another.
You alright there, Ryan?\nYour shots are dead on arrival.
Oh? Not half bad.
Okay, my turn.
Uh...?
Let me try another.
What's wrong?\nYour shots aren't packing their usual punch.
Having an off day?
Huh? You're not all talk, are you?
Hmph. You'll see soon enough. You're up next.
You might need to get your eyes checked.\nWhatever, just keep watching.
Well, you're up. Don't keep me waiting.
*sigh* Thought you weren't that bad at first,\nbut it looks like you're just a one-trick pony.
Taking the same shot over and over,\nyou're begging the goalie to figure out your game.
As I expected... Alright, my turn.
The way you're playing today, this'll be easy.
It looks like you're the one underestimating me,\nAzwan.
This one's for real, okay?
What in the heck?!
Well, well, well, where did all your vim and vigor\ngo?
Here comes the next one.
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second!
Hmm, I didn't think you were too bad at first,\nbut your shots are kinda one-note, <avatar_name>.
They're surprisingly easy to stop once I found\nyour rhythm.
As I expected... Alright, my turn.
You don't seem to be on your game today, either.\nAt this rate, you'd be lucky to get near the net.
We'll see about that.
Wha...?!
Got it! Okay, here comes another one!
Things more or less played out how I expected.
<avatar_name>, your shots were good at first,\nbut over time, it became easier for Azwan\nto figure you out and stop you cold.
But the more shots I took, the more precise they\nbecame, until Azwan couldn't even touch them.
Things more or less played out how I expected.
<avatar_name>, your shots were good at first,\nbut over time, it became easier for the goalie to\nfigure you out and stop you cold.
But the more shots I took, the more precise they\nbecame, until he couldn't even touch them.
Do you know why?
Your ability to analyze the goalie?
Is this some kind of prank?
Correct. That's what I wanted you to pick up on in\ntoday's training.
Are you being serious right now?
Please, don't disappoint me any further.\nIt makes me look bad for having high hopes\nfor you in the first place.
Well, there's only one thing to do.\nI'm gonna have to break it down and make it\nso even you can understand.
I have the goalie's data perfectly squared away\nin my mind. How to score on him, too, of course.
Naturally, that data is based on past collection.\nThe present mental and physical state creates\ndeviations. You can't be sure until you see them.
From there, I was observing the quality of the\ngoalie's condition based on his reactions to your\nshots.
Also, with my shots, I was determining the limits\nof those reactions to confirm the data so far.
At that point, I was creating a false impression\nof what my shot trajectory would look like and\nlaying the groundwork for later.
But even if you don't take the shot yourself,\nyou can still carefully observe how the goalie\nreacts to the ones your teammates take.
Once you've collected all the data,\nthat's when the real work begins.
You take a nice, precise shot on a different\ntrajectory than the one you've taught the goalie\nto expect and with difficult timing to react to.
It's really quite simple once explained.
So, I was basically a guinea pig in your\nexperiment?
You acted in exactly the way I was hoping you\nwould.
Jeez, I can't tell if that's a good thing.
This is why I needed a goalie to train with today.
<avatar_name>, using the same kind of shot from the\nstart of a match to the end isn't the brightest of\nplay styles.
Observe your opponents closely and consider the\nlong term. Sometimes, it pays to make a move that\nappears fruitless.
It's the same concept as thinking a couple steps\nahead in, say, chess or go.
I imagine you can start putting into practice what\nyou learned today.
Don't go letting me down now, eh?
I'm going on ahead, <avatar_name>!
Hey! I've been hoping to meet you, <avatar_name>.
You are...?
Well, nice to meet you.
Huh?
Oh, yeah. I neglected to introduce myself. Sorry.
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm Ryan Ortiz. I play for the US team.
I saw some of your moves at a game recently.\nYou strike me as someone with a lot of potential,\nso I thought we should meet.
...
Yeah, you've got that air about you.
Okay, I know it's sort of out of the blue,\nbut wanna practice together a little?
Sure. Let's do it!
Practice? I just got done. I'm beat.
That's what I like to hear!
Aw, don't say that. I promise\nI'll make it worth your while.
Come with me. I know a really good place.
This pitch is my own special training ground.\nWe'll be able to practice without being bothered\nhere.
Okay. Let's begin!
That's enough for today, I think.
Hmmm... Your strength's more or less\nwhat I anticipated. Basically.
However...
<avatar_name>. If you don't mind, could we\npractice again sometime? For some reason,\nI feel like we should.
Anyway, I'll clean up here.\nYou go on ahead to the locker room.
(<avatar_name>.\nWhat fascinating abilities you possess.)
(This tournament's shaping up to\nbe more interesting than I thought.)
<avatar_name>!\nYou wanna go practice with Carlos again?
Oh? You're practicing with\na player from the American team?
Whoa, you're so proactive! I wanna see what\nsoccer from other countries is like, too.\nI need to follow your example!
Anyway, go get some good practice!
Yo, <avatar_name>! Gonna go practice\nwith another country's players again today?
It's amazing how much you get out there!\nI should give it a go!
Well, good luck!
Hey, <avatar_name>.
Huh? Ryan?
You're a Japanese player, right?
Huh? Got business with Ryan?
He's probably in the office, I think.
Who's there?
Oh, it's you, <avatar_name>.
Sorry, I won't be able to practice today.\nI've got my hands full analyzing data.
You analyze data?
Data? Can I see?!
Of course! Nobody uses data better than I can.
That's surprisingly bold of you. All the same,\nI don't think I could show it to you.
This includes the strengths and weaknesses of my\nown team as well as others... each player's\nbuild, technique, and tendencies during play.
Having a grasp on all of these things\nis extremely important during a match.
In the art of war, it's said the trick\nto winning is to "know thy enemy."
If a team wants to win, then it should have this\ndata, a mind that can use it to form strategies,\nand the technique to follow them without fail.
Conversely, a team sets itself up for failure\nthrough the misinformed assumptions of dull\nplayers and a tendency for self-serving plays.
With an excellent player calling the shots and\nthe rest of the team sticking to the plan,\nvictory is certain.
So long as you have that, you can win at soccer.\nGuaranteed.
<avatar_name>, you–
Ah, hold on.
Yes, it's me.
Understood. I'll be there in a moment.
<avatar_name>, hate to do this to you after you\ncame all the way here, but I have to go to\na meeting.
Let me make it up to you.\nI'll take a good, close look at your data.
Then, next time we practice, I'll put that\nknowledge to use. It should prove useful for\nsharpening your skills.
Well, come see me again, soon.
Hey, <avatar_name>.
Ryan...?
You're a Japanese player, right?
Huh? Got business with Ryan?
He's probably in the office, I think.
Who's there?
Oh, it's you, <avatar_name>.
Sorry, I won't be able to practice today.\nI've got my hands full analyzing data.
You analyze data?
Data? Can I see?!
Of course! Nobody uses data better than I can.

<avatar_name>, you agree, don't you?
Absolutely.
You can't win that way.\n<color F03760>(Starts America Route)</color>
Heh, interesting. Very interesting.
See? You get it. You know I'm right.\nNow, I know why I saw such promise in you.
What?
Ahaha! To think, that's your reaction!
Interesting. Very interesting!
It's clear we have a whole lot to talk about.
Ah, hold on.
Yes, it's me.
Understood. I'll be there in a moment.
Looks like I have to go to a meeting. Can you come\nback another day? We'll practice together then.
(He must be a clever player\nto share my way of thinking.)
(But I'd be a little disappointed if that was\nall... He'd be unable to really keep up with me.)
(Still, it's clear he's talented. I'll have\nto make sure I get his data for what\nwe both know is coming.)
(Honestly. I can't believe he didn't\ncomprehend what I was trying to say.)
(Ever since I started putting this theory\ninto practice, my soccer's been unbeatable.)
(And they... The Japanese team lost to us at\nthe scrimmage. How can they still not see\nthe error of their ways?)
(All the same, if there's a different\npath to victory, I would love to learn of it.)
(<avatar_name>, this tournament's going to be\nvery enlightening in showing me how far\nyou can really go.)
Aren't you a Japanese player? Need something?
Ryan? He'll probably be here in a few.\nAre you friends with him or something?
What do you think? He's kind of cheeky, huh?\nHe doesn't even hold back when being introduced.
He was the same when he first met us, too.
Oh, hey, <avatar_name>. What brings you here?
Ryan? He'll probably be back in a few.
I didn't know you two knew each other.
What do you think? He's kind of cheeky, huh?\nHe doesn't even hold back when being introduced.
He was the same when he first met us, too.
Yo, <avatar_name>. What's up?
Ryan? Hang tight. He'll be back in a jiff.
I didn't know you guys knew each other. Cool.
That guy. He can come off as kinda cheeky,\ndon't you think? I guess he's always been\nthat way.
I first met him after the tryouts at school.
Two Years Ago\nCardinal Soccer School
Huh... So, you're the players\nwho passed the tryouts?
And you are?
I'm Ryan Ortiz.\nAnd since you passed, you can call me Captain.
What? How'd a twerp like you make captain?
We're gonna have to answer to this squirt?\nStop yankin' my chain!
Hmph. Looks like you're in need of some education.
Say what?
In soccer, it's not size or age that counts.\nIt's ability.
Nothing like some first-hand experience to drive\na point home, though. Come at me... together.
Heh. Kid doesn't know his place.
Don't be surprised when you see what we can do.
What the...?! This kid's crazy!
This is unreal. I can't even touch the ball.
Good grief.
This is the level my players are at? So much for\nmaking world champions out of this team.
Even with my brains and skills,\nthis is gonna take a lotta work.
Urgh. Are you saying we'd be holding you back?
Yes. Your level is too low\nto handle my stratagems.
In fact, I might have a\nbetter chance if I go it alone.
Hey... Ryan, was it?
What it sounds like, is that if we could\nsomehow get stronger, you could forge us\ninto the greatest team the world has ever seen.
Finally... you realize.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
If you lot can somehow become competent, if you\nbecome capable of playing soccer my way, then,\nyes, I would make us the best in all the world.
I guarantee it.
So, yeah, that about sums him up.\nHonestly, he's terrible. But, you know what?
His skill is unquestionable. He takes soccer\nmore seriously than anyone. And out of all\nof us, he's got the team in mind the most.
That's why we all recognize him as captain.\nAnd as a teammate.
Still not a fan of how he treats people sometimes.\nBut, at least I know we can count on him.
Is that not the cockiest thing?!
But, you know what? His soccer skill is\nunmistakable and he pours everything into making\nour team succeed. Can't complain about that.
That's why we all recognize him as captain.\nAnd as a teammate.
Though the way he talks still bothers me.
What? It doesn't bother you even a bit?
Jeez, your friends must be somethin' else...
Hey, <avatar_name>! You're here.
I got a chance to see your match.\nYour play is worthy of analysis.
Which reminds me...\nAs promised, I went over your data.
It appears you have two weak points:\nobservation and kicking accuracy.
But a number of weaknesses caught my eye.\nIn particular, your powers of observation\nand kicking accuracy.
So in order to improve both of these aspects\nsimultaneously, I'll teach you how I shoot.
If you can master this, your proficiency\nin both those fields should skyrocket.
Now, let's head to the training grounds.
Hold up! What about OUR practice, Ryan?
What are we going to do about team training?
I've already given you the training program.\nJust follow it to the letter, and there shouldn't\nbe any problems. I'll be back before you're done.
Shall we, <avatar_name>?
You have some interesting priorities these days...
But... Never seen Ryan take an\ninterest in anyone like that before.
<avatar_name> is a great player and all,\nbut he's not THAT great, is he?
Well now!
Incredible! You've mastered much\nin such a short time, <avatar_name>!
Impressive.\nNot even I was expecting that much from you.
(His growth has exceeded predictions,\neven if only slightly.)
(Scour the globe and you'd still\nbe lucky to find this kind of talent.)
(What a shame he's gone unnoticed.\nI'd love to keep watching him develop\nfrom this close vantage.)
I'd like to ask you something, <avatar_name>.
Do you have any interest in coming to our soccer\nschool and playing for America? In the short term.
That's not a bad idea!
I've never really thought about it.
I see. Well, if you're ever interested, then speak\nto me. I'll enable your transition however I can.
I see... Well, give it some consideration.
If you come to our school, then you'll have the\nopportunity to hone your skills even further.\nI guarantee it.
Anyway, how about we get\nstarted on today's training?
Actually, even in America there's only one\nother player who can keep up with me in\none-on-one training.
Consider it an honor.
I've seen your matches plenty of times by now,\nbut you never fail to surprise me.
Sheesh, is there no limit to your potential?
(This is the first time I've seen a player\nimprove so absurdly quick. He's far exceeded\nmy predictive models.)
(At this rate, someday he'll surpass even me...)
(No, that's ridiculous! Completely absurd!)
(I'm perfection itself! No one can surpass me!\nNo one!)
(<avatar_name> is the only exception. I just\nstill don't know what I've not accounted for.)
<avatar_name>. You're... an incredible player.\nTo the point that your very existence is puzzling.
Just like Tsubasa and Schneider,\nyou are no doubt top notch.
Someday, you'll be on a pedestal, representing\nthe world's best in soccer. I guarantee it.
To be honest, I won't be making an appearance\nin this tournament for adjunct circumstances.
But I'll be keeping a close eye on your play,\nso keep at it, and grow your talent.
You're... truly a fascinating specimen to me.
In fact, your talent is so fascinating to me\nthat I just now have devised a plan.
What sort of plan, you ask?\nHeh heh, you'll have to wait and find out.
America may have lost in the quarterfinals,\nbut if I'd been there, then...\nNo. That doesn't matter anymore.
<avatar_name>, you and the rest of Japan\nhave shown astonishing growth. You've even made\nit to the semifinals. Truly fascinating.
Good luck in the semifinals.\nI look forward to seeing your development.
To be honest, I wasn't planning on making an\nappearance this tournament for various reasons,\nbut your talent is truly fascinating.
I really want to play against you now,\nso I made a quick alteration to my plans.
We're obviously going it to the finals,\nso you'll need to be there, too.
That's your duty, seeing as you've upset\nmy original plans. Don't disappoint me.
To be honest, based on my analysis of Japan\nduring the scrimmage, there was almost no\nchance of you making it this far.
Tsubasa is one thing, but your improvement\nhas been particularly impressive.
According to my analysis...\nYou will be the central in who wins the finals.
Now, go! Win and prove to the world\nthat our style of soccer is the proper one.
I'll be studying the results closely. Good luck.
Maybe you're thinking that you can\nbecome the world's best player on your own.
But there's always a bigger fish.
I'll make you realize that you've been dancing\nto my pipe the whole time. I hope you're looking\nforward to your fate.
(<avatar_name>... To be honest, I still don't\nsee how exactly your approach yields victory.)
(But there's no way my way of playing could wrong.\nAll the calculations were correct...)
(So I'll defeat you come finals, and show\nyou once and for all the error of your ways!)
(<avatar_name>... To be honest, I still don't\nsee how exactly your approach yields victory.)
(But there's no way my way of playing could wrong.\nAll the calculations were correct...)
(So by all means, keep on climbing to finals.)
(So I'll defeat you come finals, and show\nyou once and for all the error of your ways!)
(Still though, <avatar_name> has a\npeculiarity that arouses my interests.)
(Studying him may be the best thing\nto come out of this tournament.)
<avatar_name>, the best outcome on\ndefense is have stolen the opponent's ball.
But there's no need for a gaudy,\noverpowering show of force to achieve that.
It's inefficient. Done only for the\nself-satisfaction of the player.
When I play defense, I start by carefully\nanalyzing my opponent's movement. Then when I find\na weakness I steal the ball in one swift strike.
Humans have limited stamina, so we should\neliminate as much unnecessary exertion as is\npossible. Don't you agree?
I know... I'll teach you a little trick I use.
Now, listen closely...
And that's where most players show their bad\nhabits. Focus on that and you'll find your\nopenings.
Once you've found one, it's a simple matter\nof stepping in to take possession of the ball.
Remember, that the briefer the movement,\nthe harder it is for the opponent to read,\nand therefore the more likely to succeed.
Try it out on a teammate first. I assume you're\nalready familiar with most of their habits?
All you need now is more experience. Good luck.
<avatar_name>, the most common cause of passes\nbeing intercepted is their path being predicted.
And when that happens, it's undoubtedly because\nthere's a straight line connecting the passing\nplayer and the receiving player.
But to turn this around, make sure your\npass doesn't follow that straight line.\nIt'll be much harder to intercept.
I recommend throwing off the defense\nby kicking the ball anywhere else.
Give your passes spin to land in a particular spot\nand then bounce to where you're really aiming.\nThis is harder to read than a simple curve ball.
With your skills and passing instincts, I\ndoubt this will be difficult for you to master.
Want to give it a shot?
Hey, <avatar_name>. You have something\nto say about our match with Brazil?
Well? Spit it out.
Were those strict orders really needed?
The American players seemed boring.
Hmm? What are you talking about?
And here I was wondering what you'd say.
What does being boring or interesting\nhave to do with winning?
I thought you already realized this, but if\nAmerica and Brazil went head to head normally,\nwe'd have almost no chance of winning.
But with my analysis of both my opponents and\nmy teammates, I was able to run all sorts of\nsimulations of the match.
That's how I could find the opportunity\nfor greatest output yield and make certain\nit came to fruition.
This goes without saying, but the goal of soccer\nis to win. And I'm the only one on the team\nwho knows how.
That's why I give everyone orders, and also\nwhy they listen to me. Isn't that obvious?
Besides, it lets them focus on their play without\nhaving to think. This allows them to play at\nclose to their full potential using my data.
I analyze and understand everyone's abilities.\nI can find the strategy that will lead to victory.\nAnd that allows for efficient execution.
With these three things, any match is easily\nwinnable. My win record is proof of that.
In order to lead the team to victory,\nsometimes the captain has to stand above\nas an absolute authority. A tyrant.
Remember that.\nYou might end up leading a team some day.
I call this the Flores Dribble, <avatar_name>.
First you shift the ball outward as if you're\ngoing that way, in order to control where your\nopponent is focusing his attention and movement.
Then, with the tiniest possible movement, you\nquickly pivot and head in the opposite direction,\nleaving your opponent behind.
I use this technique all the time, but, well,\nthat's because of how effective it is.
It works because a soccer player's instinct\nis to keep their eyes on the ball, and their\nbody will naturally follow suit.
From what I can tell, your ankles definitely\nhave the flexibility to master this.
Now, you give it a try.
Nope, all wrong. If you kick the ball out\nthat far, it'll take too much time to switch\ndirections.
Your pivot is still too languorous.\nIt needs to be sharper on the inside,\nor your initial feint will go to waste.
Hmm... Well, good enough. I'd say you pass.
At this point you can work out the kinks\nwith your teammates. I know you can do this.
But to think you'd master it so quickly. You're\nlike a sponge, siphoning the skills of others.
(I'd really like to keep an eye\non this talent from close by.)
I watched Japan's last game.\nYour inertia carried the match to victory.
Hmm? Does "momentum" seem too ambiguous to you?
But the data has conclusively proven\nthat elevated mental states improve play.\nI would be a fool to ignore that effect.
That said, to put my opinion plainly,\nit is a treacherous force to rely upon.
Because when it's halted, not only do your\nallies lose morale, but the opponents start\ngaining momentum of their own.
To put it another way...\nWhen the opponents have momentum or inertia,\nyou can use it to your advantage.
For example, by stopping an overconfident offense\nor getting past a tightened defense.
Your opponents lose momentum, while your teammates\ngain morale. The more momentum they're losing,\nthe stronger the effect.
You might say it's just a matter of attitude,\nbut mental states can have an effect on\nthe outcome of a match. My data proves it.
Control even your opponent's emotions and you will\nhave complete control the game. Remember that.
Of course, under my command even that\ncan be dealt with little issue.
Magnificent, <avatar_name>. You beat me.
I never imagined I'd lose in soccer.
I still have a lot to learn. Soccer is deep.
Incidentally, I taught you that Analyze Shot,\nbut that was an incomplete version.
Sometimes, you'll encounter goalies in top form,\nwho don't leave any openings, which makes\nthat shot less than ideal.
That's when I would use this other shot.
The idea is to create an optical illusion where\nthe goalie sees you kicking with your right foot,\nwhile you're actually kicking with your left.
The misleading form and the surprise kick will\nthrow off the goalie's stance and create the\nopening you need to make a goal.
I call it the Rabona Illusion.
With your technique, the Rabona itself\nshould be possible with enough training.
All you need is to add in the analytical\nskills and shot control you learned from me.
Make good use of it.
Also, about the "what you need to shoot" thing\nwe were discussing the other night.\nYou and Blake were right.
Now, you get it!
With insufficient power, they'd end up blocking\nit with some part of their body, even if you\ngot lucky.
The perfect shot is a difficult concept.
C'mon, what about our Justice Blake Shot?
C'mon, we didn't get a chance to do it, but\nwhat about that shot we came up with that match?
You mean the one where I add more control to\nyour Blake Shot with another kick? That one?
Tak! Power and control make the ultimate shot!\nWho said it had to be done by yourself?
True. Complementing each others weaknesses\nis what it means to be a team.
Then, how's about we make one together?
Huh?
I shoot my Blake Shot, and you\nkick it again to add more control.
No one normal could manage that...\nBut you ain't normal, right Ryan?
Hmph. What an interesting idea.\nCertainly it's within the scope of reason.
Power and control make the ultimate shot!\nWho said it had to be done by yourself, right?
Right. Complementing each others weaknesses\nis what it means to be a team.
Come to think of it, you learned that\nshot from Blake, didn't you <avatar_name>?
Meaning you inherited his weakness, but...
Aww, shut up.
But with me, we can make up for that weakness.\nI have no doubt that we can manage it together.
If, and this is just if, we end up partnering up,\nwe could take the world by storm.
With the ultimate shot!







Haaah!
Aaah!
This is it!
There!

I'm just warming up!
Gahaha! You don't mess with the Blake!
Soccer's all about power!
And don't forget it!
Okay! Next I'll put us in the lead!
And there's more where that came from!
We'll never lose!
No problem! We'll be back in the lead!
C'mon, let's do this right!
It's not over yet!
Nice play!
Excellent!
Hey, pretty good!
Oh no!
What the--?!
Get 'em!
Pretty pass!
Heck yeah!

Yo! This way!

Fine! I'll do it!
We'll show 'em our power!
Alright!
See that?! Pure power!
Huh... Whatever works, I guess!
As weak as always, Tsubasa!
So you've gotten a little better, huh?!
Hyah! Time for a tiger hunt!
Łoł! Not bad, Hyuga!
It's all about power, Misaki!
Y-You're pretty good, Misaki!
You need more guts, Matsuyama!
Ya got a strong chin, Matsuyama!
I'll face you down every time, Misugi!
Łoł! Not bad, Misugi!
Come back when you're ready, Takasugi!
Nice play, Takasugi.
How do ya like them apples, Emperor?!
So this is Schneider! I dig it!
You need more power, Heine!
What the heck?!
Guess I took out the French General!
Th-This is what they mean by artistic?!
I'm fiercer, Napoleon!
Oh no! Let my guard down!
You're no match for me, Jean!
Y-You're pretty good for a shrimp!
Train more, Kluivoort!
Not bad, Kluivoort!
Gahaha! Soccer is all about strength!
Don't mock me, Rusciano!
You're supposed to be Brazil's Ace?
This guy's like a machine!
I've enough talent for you, Diaz!
Ya should've been a gymnast, Diaz!
Hyah! Just bagged me a Black Panther!
Ugh, scratched by the kitty!
Victory goes to the bold, Senghor!
N-Not bad, Senghor!
Hyah! Train your body. too, Ryan!
Grrr... Pretty good, Ryan!
Never forget how weak you are!
Huh! Never seen so many weaklings.
I'll take you head on!
No one messes with me and survives!
Tak! Tenth shot, here we go!
*sigh* What even was that?\nThey're getting weaker as you go, man.
Is all this bulking up just making you into a\nlumbering oaf?
Endurance is extremely important.\nCan you cut it with so little stamina?
Quiet! I'm working on it right now, as a matter of\nfact. I don't need you buzzing in my ear!
Sup, <avatar_name>? Need something?
What were you working on today?
You ran out of gas today?
Oh, were you watching?
Well done, though.\nYou noticed it was more than just taking shots.
Hey, do you know about the different muscles\nand muscle types?
Not you, too! Nobody gets it.
Well, you asked for it.\nTime to take you to school.
Listen up, <avatar_name>. With muscles, you got—
—essentially, in such a case you'd\nbe using this muscle, but—
I-I see! That's fascinating!
That's... a lot to take in.
You really think so? Your face says otherwise.
I guess I'm not surprised. Not a lot of people\ncan really understand this stuff,\neven those who bother to study it at school.
Oh... Well, whatever.
There's not a whole lot of people who can\nunderstand something so specialized,\neven among those of us studying it at school.
But anyway, I should probably just start with the\nbasics. The human body has two types of muscles.
The first is fast-twitch muscles, which lack\nendurance but make up for it with explosive power\nover short bursts.
The other is slow-twitch muscles, which aren't\nthat strong but have added endurance.
Some soccer players use endurance as their weapon\nof choice, but I prefer using bursts of power.\nSimply put, I'm all about power plays.
Fast-twitch muscles are important for that\nstyle of play, but with the way they work,\nthey can't keep at it for long.
Though, you can always conserve your strength to\nrun longer plays, but that's not my style.
What I like is plays with force and power that\nexplodes like dynamite!
Makes sense...
My sentiments exactly!
You don't sound very convinced.
Right?! You crush your opponents with sheer might.\nIt's simple, but what more could you want?!
Anywho, let's stay on topic. It's not all muscles.\nHow you use your body is vital to getting a bigger\nburst of power when you need it.
The training I was doing today was to focus on\nthat.
If I get it down, I can overpower my opponents in\nmore ways and pack more power into my shots than\never before.
But there's a tricky part to this equation.\nEven at my level, it requires a fair bit of\nconcentration.
And like muscles, pushing that concentration for\ntoo long burns you out.
So, I'm trying to limit that concentration to\nwhen I'm in possession of the ball.\nWhen I don't have the ball, I let myself reset.
That reset is important. If I strain through the\nwhole match, I end up playing even worse than\nwithout thinking about my muscles.
So, what do you say, <avatar_name>?\nDoes my training make a little more sense now?
I'm gonna study muscles more.
Oh, yeah! It's all about power!
Don't stress. After all, athletes my age at my\nlevel are few and far between, even across the US.
Plus, you can't just know this stuff in your head.\nAt your level, worry about getting stronger first.\nThe rest will follow.
Yeah...\nYou'll probably learn it faster by doing it.
Check it, the most important part of this training\nis squeezing out all your strength in a single\nmoment.
Visualize yourself exploding as soon as you get\nthe ball. Think of it like setting off dynamite\nbeneath your feet.
Now, I'm going to give you the privilege of\njoining me for my marvelous training. Let's start.
And don't think you can weasel out of it,\nnot after hearing my whole lecture.
Okay, that's enough practice for now.\nTime for a ten set of sprints.
Phew... Guess this muscle's not holding up its\nend of the bargain. Better focus on it in weight\ntraining.
We've... We've met before, right?\n<avatar_name>, I think?
A Japanese player?
Huh, so you're name's <avatar_name>?
So what do you want, anyway?\nI'm a busy guy, y'know.
Staying behind for extra training?
Your physique is amazing.
Somethin' like that. I'm trying to pinpoint a\nweakness in my body that I noticed in practice.
Every day I've gotta use a\ntraining menu based on this stuff.
Ha! No duh!
Do you even know how many American teams tried\nto recruit me? I'm kinda a big deal, y'know.
Obviously, I've got the talent, and I ain't gonna\nmiss a day of trainin', but I gotta make sure\nmy body is all in order, as well.
Just check out these quads!\nThat's pure effort, baby!
I mean, nothin's more important to an athlete\nthan his body. Don't be like those chumps\nwho aren't totally invested!
By the way, you seem pretty relaxed. That's what\nI'd expect from a player representing his nation.
Whoops, sorry, it's time for my weight training.\nNo way I'm gonna miss out on my peak time of day.
You should try hustling for that muscle, too.
Sore today, strong tomorrow, right? If you had\nenough muscle to keep up with my training,\nI could teach ya what a real workout is.
Later! Be sure to eat right and get some sleep!
Those are the cornerstones for an athlete!
Alright, the training's working. Looks like I\ncan squeeze out a little more jumping strength.
Oh hey, <avatar_name>!
That reminds me, I got a peek at one of Japan's\nmatches. Looks like you're doin' pretty good out\nthere!
Plus, ain't ya a little sturdier than when\nwe first met? It's not, like, an in your face\ndifference, but I can tell.
With stamina like that, I bet you\ncould keep up with my training!
So just as I promised, I'll show\nwhat a REAL workout feels like!
Right behind you, Coach!
I'm not sure I'm as athletic as you...
Sure, leave it to me!
Heh, well... You'll never find anyone\nas good as me, even in America!
But if I'm doin' this training and you're not,\nthat gap's just gonna get bigger, don't ya think?\nDon't be shy now!
Anyway, just leave everything to me!
I've been taught by specialists ever\nsince I started goin' to that school.
And after I started puttin' it to work, I've\nbeen scouted for football, basketball, track...\nYou name it. Everyone wants me.
So I can teach ya everythin' there is to\nknow about muscles and muscle training!\nYou're in good hands!
Now, let's do this!
Ooh, you got that shot hummin'!
That's the proof of the power in those delts\nand lats! All that training we did is paying\ndividends!
Still, it's pretty impressive to grow so much so\nquick! Guess I can call ya a fellow athlete now!
I'm glad I chose soccer,\nsince it led me to a fella like you.
Why did you choose soccer, anyway?
What was your second choice of sport?
Hmm...
Football, for sure. I mean, American\nfootball to you foreigners, I guess.
I said this before, but people from all\nkindsa sports were tryin' to recruit me.
But especially football. They were all like "your\nname could go down in history!" Real passionate.
But one day Mr. Cardinal came down\nand said somethin' special to me.
"Soccer is the most popular sport in the world.\nSo wouldn't you like to be the best in the world?"
That's what made me choose soccer.
I bet you're thinkin'\n"Just like that? What a maroon."
But we're talking best player of\nthe most popular sport in the whole world!
Now THAT'S a dream worth chasing! That's just\nhow talented I am! The athlete in me was electric\nwith excitement.
Heck, I'm gettin' excited all over again!\nLet's have a match! Straight up showdown,\nno tricks, power versus power.
Phew... Going up against you is an experience.
Oh yeah, Japan made it through the prelims, huh?\nNever saw that comin', after our match.
We made it through, too,\nof course, but next up is...
Naw, forget it. There's a lot goin' on\nwith our team, but it's not your problem.
Anyway, lookin' forward to playing you again!\nYou're, like, my protégé now!
Wish we could play each other again this\ntournament, but we already missed our shot.
That don't mean we'll never play, though! And\nuntil then, you'd better not slack on your\ntraining! Can't wait to see what you become!
For now, just prove that my training\nwas worth something by winning!
Were I able to choose,\nI'd rather face you in a real match.
And for that, we both need to win\none more game and make it to the finals.
No way we're gonna lose,\nso you'd better not either!
It's been a while since\nanyone got me this revved up.
I'll show you my full power in\nthe finals, so I hope you're ready!
Hey, <avatar_name>!\nGuess you really like training with me, huh?
By the way, you play any sports other than soccer?
Personally, I'm a top level player for\na myriad of other major American sports.
Hmm? Got somethin' to say?
I mean, ain't it natural for someone as good as\nme? No matter what sport it is, I can do it.
I dunno what you think, but there's a huge\nbenefit to playing lots of different sports.
Each sport has its own particular techniques,\nbut it ain't like none of 'em translate to other\nsports. It has a kinda cool effect.
Like, take my dribble. I borrowed the movements\nfrom football. And who'd have thought,\nfootball players are hard to stop!
Isn't that just raw power?
What part of that is technique?
What?! Don't be stupid!
A soccer dribble with the strength of football\nmeans you can just plow right through anyone!
Do you even listen to yourself? Ain't\nadding power to your run a football technique?
What, you think it's not a technique unless you're\ndoing stOof like backflips or some cheap feint?
Try it out for yourself.\nOnce you do, you'll understand just how\namazin' the great Blake Martin is!
But don't worry, even a scrawny guy like\nyou can pull it off. I'll teach you everything,\nfrom soup to nuts.
Course, Mr. "it's just raw power"\nhere ain't got no right to refuse.
Course, Mr. "what part of that is technique"\nhere ain't got no right to refuse.
We're goin' until you get it! Got that?!
Okay, Azwan, don't let go of that sandbag!
Got it! Now, bring it on!
Ugh... Phew...
Looks like you can handle it now!\nThis training's payin' off!
Of course, how can I take on the world's best\nshots if I can't even handle a tackle from you?
Good attitude! One more time!
Hey, it's you.
If you wanna train, you'll have to wait.\nI'm still helpin' this guy out.
Oh, you know Blake, <avatar_name>?
Have you ever thought about\npicking your friends better?
You took the words right outta my mouth.
I know... Since we all know each other,\nhow 'bout a three way practice?
Oh, you're a friend of Blake's.\nThen, you can go first.
Nah, that's not gonna work.
I know... Since we all know each other,\nhow 'bout a three way practice?
You're cool with that, right <avatar_name>?
What was that training you were doing?
What's that sandbag for?
We're beefin' up Azwan here,\nso he can take on the world's fiercest shots.
Well, it's basically the tackle training they\ndo in football. If he can handle my tackle,\nhe can handle anything.
Oh, they use it for tackle training in football.
Azwan holds up the sandbag and tries to survive\nmy tackle. That'll build up the muscles\nhe needs to face any body blow.
Hey, you wanna try tackling, too?\nIt feels pretty good just slamming into\nsomeone with everythin' you've got!
Go ahead. Give it a shot!
Ngh! Phew... Not as bad as Blake's,\nbut heavier than I expected.
Ha! You're pretty good at that!\nYou could probably even use that in soccer.
Remember that feelin', and try using\nit in a Shoulder Charge. Plow through your\nopponents like it's goin' out of style!
Just do it a few more times to really\nget the feel for it. Help him out, Azwan!
Tch, fine. This is what\nit costs me to tolerate an idiot...
Hmm? You say something?
No, I just thought this was supposed to be\nMY workout. But fine, I'll keep you company.
Right on! Okay, give it to him good,\n<avatar_name>!
You wanna know the trick to goin' one-on-one?
Ain't it easy?
Just try slamming into them with everything you've\ngot. If you're bigger, you'll send 'em flying!
You're better than that.
You're saying you're just a meathead?
Ha! Figured me out, huh?
Course power is important,\nbut you need technique, too.
What was that?!
Don't be stupid! I'm an elite athlete.
If you wanna come out on top,\nyou need the right technique!
...!
Did you... just trick me into spillin' the beans?
Fine, whatever, I'll tell ya.
For this kinda thing, it's better to learn\nfirsthand, rather than hear an explanation.\nWe'll go one-on-one... for real.
Just come right at me with the ball,\nand I'll cut you off!
C'mon, bring it!
So? You get it?
You couldn't use all of your strength\njust now, could you?
That's 'cause I shut you down by stepping on the\npoint where you'd be able to really move your legs\nbefore you could.
Plus I went right for the point\nI'd be able to use 100% of MY power!
Basically, I could use all my strength,\nwhile you couldn't.
I use unstoppable power and lightning-fast\nfootwork to put my opponent on their back foot.\nThose're the two pillars of my one-on-one attack.
If you can master it, you'll always be able to win\na "fair match." Heck, you could probably win an\nunfair one now and then, too.
You'll have to figure out\nthe timing on your own, though.
C'mon, don't give me that! After all that training\nwe did together, you'll get it in no time!
You're an amazing guy, <avatar_name>!
Never thought you'd completely master the Blake\nShot... Guess my time was well spent teachin' ya.
Alright! It's time for somethin' special!\nI'll teach ya the advanced Blake Shot!
I call it the Super Blake Shot!\nSounds strong, don't it?
The old Blake Shot's power is nothin' compared to\nthis one. It's a full body blockbuster blow out!
Don't worry... there's a simple trick.
Just plant your lead foot hard, swing your leg,\nand give it your 120%! That's it! BAM!
Well, the "swing your leg" part is trickier than\nit sounds. You need both your physical and mental\nstrength on the same page, or it ain't gonna work.
The folks who can do it get it on their first try,\nand those who can't never do.\nThat's just how it is.
So, which are you, <avatar_name>?
Personally, I got faith in ya. Give it a shot!
Eat this!
Super Blake... Shot!
Whoa... crazy!
Whoa... crazy!
Now that's what I'm talkin' 'bout!\nThat was a perfect Super Blake Shot!
Now, you can use the true Blake Shot too!
What? You don't like the name?
C'mon, don't sweat the details! Anyway, it's got\nmy name on it so it's guaranteed to be amazin'!
Still, a scrawny-lookin' guy like you\nmastering the Super Blake Shot...\nMust be from all my training!
Ga ha! It'll come in handy for sure!\nBlow away everyone in front of you!
Oh right, about the whole "what you need to\nshoot" thing, we were talkin' about the\nother night... You were right.
You finally got it?
Even goalies are trainin' their butts off to\nget stronger, just like me. Which means I need\nmore than power to beat 'em.
The perfect shot is tough, huh?
What are you blabbering about? Have you\nalready forgotten about our Justice Blake Shot?
What are you blabbering about? We didn't use\nit this game, but have you already forgotten\nabout the shot I came up with mid-match?
You mean the one where you kick my Blake Shot\nto give it more control? That one?
Exactly. Power and precision combine to form\nthe ultimate shot. No one ever said it had to be\ndone alone, did they?
I guess not. That's why we're a team,\nto cover each other's weaknesses!
Then why don't we make one together?
Huh?
I'll kick your Blake Shot\nto add my own precision to it.
This would be practically impossible for an\nordinary player, but for me it would be\nchild's play.
Heh. You come up with the craziest stuff. You and\nme together would be invincible though, for sure.
Power and precision combine to form the ultimate\nshot. No one ever said it had to be done alone,\ndid they?
Yeah, I guess not. That's why we're on a team...\nTo cover each other's weaknesses!
That reminds me, <avatar_name>.\nYou learned a shot from Ryan, right?
Or more like, he handed it over\n'cause he didn't have enough power for it.
Save it, Blake.
Then, how about I make up for the power?\nI have faith you can handle it.
If we ever end up teaming up,\nwe'll show the world what we've got!
With the world's best shot!







Hyaaah!

Oh yeah!
Defending all the time would be boring!
Ha, you let your guard down!
They always underestimate the keeper!
Heh. Y'like my shot?
I like to mix it up sometimes.
Soccer is why I draw breath!
I don't do ties!
C'mon, we still need more!
It's not over yet!
Gah! I'll get the next one for sure!
Th-They got one...
Darn it! This is my fault!
Yo, nice play!
Pretty good!
Not bad!
But it can't...
What the--?!
Trip 'em up!
Nice pass!
Tremendous!
I'll handle this!
Here I go!
Here!
Pass it to me!
Hey! Over here!
Pass!
Time to take it up a notch!
Just what I've been waiting for!
It's survival of the fittest out here!
Ha! Is that all, Tsubasa?!
A tiger? I'm falling asleep over here!
Soccer isn't art, Misaki!
I expected an eagle to actually fly!
Admittedly, you've got skills, Misugi!
Sick of your circus tricks, Tachibana!
That was a falcon? What a joke!
You're getting rusty, Soda!
Emperor? Certainly not of this pitch!
What a sad shot for the Trickster!
Flashy doesn't score goals, Heine!
Hafta do better than that, Pierre!
No cannon fire will deter me, Napoleon!
You couldn't fight off a wet towel!
Try harder next time, Rusciano!
Not living up to your uniform, Carlos!
Where's your national pride, Alberto?!
Diaz, you cheapen the word "prodigy."
South America's Black Panther, eh? Ha!
You've got no oomph, Senghor!
You are a vulture. A pathetic scavenger.
Haha! What's the matter, Ryan?
I'm not broken yet, Blake!
I'll be the world's greatest goalie!
I decided... Soccer is my life!
Soccer's not just a game!
Ugh...
C'mon now, what was that?\nEven a fly could've stopped that shot.
I-I don't need you to tell me that...
Ha! What's with that defeatist attitude? I'm\namazed you even made it on the American team.
Gah...
Hey, aren't you <avatar_name>?
Huh? Who're you?
You're on the Japanese team, right?\nI saw you on the bench in our scrimmage.
So? What do you want?
I've come to test my skills!
I've come for a grudge match!
Testing yourself, huh? But is there even\nanything worth testing? They didn't even\nfield you in the scrimmage, right?
You're a funny guy. You think you can beat me\nwhen they didn't even field you in the scrimmage?
But sure, why not? Backing down from\na challenge is against my principles.
Sorry to be a buzzkill, Azwan, but we've got a\nteam meeting coming up soon. You don't have time.
Tch!
Fine, fine. Then we'll settle it\nwith a single penalty kick, alright?
Now bring it on!
Bah! All bark and no bite. I don't even\nfeel like having a real match anymore.
C'mon, Azwan! Let's go.
Geez, I heard you the first time.
Hey, you.
You'd better improve if you want\na real match with me, you got that?
(Today's practice is over,\nbut I feel like it wasn't enough for me.)
(Everyone else is already gone though... Guess\nI'll have to settle for free training on my own.)
Oh... It's you.
You came back to challenge me again?
Well, perfect timing. I've got time, so why not?\nI accept your challenge!
Hey now, you've hardly changed at all\nsince last time! Aren't you embarrassed to\nbe repping your country?!
Frustrated?\nThen hit that ball with everything you've got!
(Wh-What the...?!)
(Up until now, I've been easily catching them.\nBut that last one I had to punch away...)
Huh. So you really can do it.\nI have to give props to that last shot.
But you're still a long way from actually\ntaking a goal from me. Just keep on\ntraining until you get better.
Besides, even Japan's gotta have some fierce\ncompetition over the seats on the team, yeah?\nSomeone with no skill's not gonna last as a rep.
Me, off the team? Not happening.
I know that.
Ha, I've heard the same from plenty of guys on\nthe American team. I've made 'em all drop out.
Oh, really? That's fine then.
You know, it wasn't easy making it onto this team.\nI had to bust my butt harder than anyone.
There were goalies better than me,\nbut I beat all of them and took my place here.
Which means I wouldn't be surprised if\nsomeone even better pops out of the woodwork,\nso I keep on training to be able to beat them.
I have to represent America. I have to.
Sorry... I guess I got off track there.
Anyway, what I was trying to say is\nthat you're not good enough to beat me.
But if you're frustrated at that,\nthen keep training and try again.
Well, not that you'll ever win.
Yo, <avatar_name>.
I happened to see your game the other day.\nLooks like you've improved a bit.
So how about we have another match today?
(Tch! This guy's shots are on\nanother level from last time!)
(Even I can only barely stop them!)
Łoł! You actually got a goal on me?!
...
(I don't wanna admit it, but he got me good.)
<avatar_name>... You can be my rival.
To close that huge gap between us in such a short\ntime means you've been putting in the effort.
...
Hey, why do you try so hard in soccer anyway?
Because it's fun.
To fulfill my dream.
Fun, huh? If that's really all it is,\nthen I'm kinda jealous.
I mean, it's fun for me too,\nbut it's more than that.
I get it. I have a dream, too.
Actually, I wasn't born in America.
I came here after passing a test at a soccer\nschool Mr. Cardinal opened up in my home country.
I was so happy. At school, I wouldn't have to\nworry about food, and I could focus on soccer.
But the school's pretty harsh in its own way.\nI had to compete with all my teammates.\nIt's a dog-eat-dog world.
You could even be expelled as soon as you\nstarted to fall behind your other teammates.
But if you can win a spot among the regulars,\nthey'll give you everything you need to live,\ngood mentorship, and a path to going pro.
So I decided I'd win every competition and\nbecome a success. My resolve won't lose to anyone.
And after I succeeded, I got famous.\nI became a goal for other people.
Well, I guess that's the American dream.
Anyway, that's enough for today.
Still, I'm surprised weak little\nJapan made it through the prelims.
You guys even beat Senegal...
...
Sorry, never mind...
Anyway, that just shows how far you've come.
Next time we fight, I'll play for real.\nLook forward to getting completely shut out!
I'm definitely a little frustrated at what\nhappened to us, but I'll be even better by\nthe next big tournament.
And when we play each other again,\nI'll shut out not just you, but your entire time!\nJust you wait!
If we're going to play each other again,\nit'll be in the finals.
Look forward to seeing a completely\ndifferent America from the scrimmage!
Just one more game until America becomes\nthe number one team of this generation.
But back in the scrimmages I never even\nimagined it might be between us and Japan.
Last time I wasn't taking it seriously,\nbut this time I'm going all out.
I'll show you the difference between us and\ncompletely shut you out. Just you wait!
Hey, Stone! What was with that defense?!\nYou let Blake stomp all over us!
Huh? But it's just practice.\nThere's no need for us to go all out...
What are you, an idiot?! He'll come\nplowing right through you like he's been doing!
But like you said, he always does that.\nAnd it's just practice, so I figured...
Look here, do you really think someone who holds\nback in practice can pull it off when it counts?!
The defense has to take on the opponent's ace,\nwhether you like it or not! So you'd better get\nused to that in practice!
Blake's a sturdy guy. He won't be hurt by\naccident. So treat him like an enemy ace\nand stop him with everything you've got!
Okay... I won't hold back next time.
Yo, <avatar_name>. You need something today?
I got to hear something good!
You've done enough, thank you!
You mean my talk with Stone?
I'm glad you learned something,\nbut don't you ever be Blake's training partner.
We'd get in big trouble\nif he injured a foreign player.
Huh? H-Hey, get back here, <avatar_name>!
What was that all about?
Ah, dangit!
What's got you so upset?
You shouldn't lose you temper.
You'd be pissed too, if your so-called teammates\nwere slacking in practice and had the nerve to\nblame YOU for it!
How can I not be angry?! My teammates\nscrewed up, and somehow it's MY fault?!
In a practice game today, the guy who was\nsupposed to be marking the ace got careless\nand let him slip away.
Thanks to that, he was free to go head-to-head\nwith me. Well, I stopped the shot,\nso it was fine...
But then the guy who lost his mark says it's my\nfault for giving bad directions! Pisses me off!
Make sure you always do the job you're given,\n<avatar_name>. If not, the whole team can\nfall apart.
Especially with marks. Screw up with one\nof those, and that leads directly to losing\npoints. There's no such thing as overdoing it.
If you ever have to mark something, go hard on it.\nDiscouraging the opponent is also part of your\njob.
Yo, <avatar_name>!
I've been meaning to tell you this, but you\nplayed real well in that game the other day.
You crippled your opponent's offense with that\ntight defense. That's definitely the way to play,\nyou know?
But don't tell me you're satisfied with just that.\nFrom where I'm standing, you've got a ways to go.
You've gotta go even harder on the attack.\nIf you're gonna do something, do it all the way.
Do I have to go that far?
Okay, I'll do it!
It's survival of the fittest out there\non the field. If you don't get them first,\nthey'll get you.
And you can forget about going up against\na better player if you have to hesitate.\nDon't you wanna win?
Ha! That's the spirit! Guess you realize\nthat it's survival of the fittest out there\non the field!
You wanna skim right below the level of a foul.\nIf you can slow them down, that's how you win.
You don't keep winning if you stick to clean\nplays. So it's important to have someone to\nhandle that kinda thing.
I know you can do it.\nWork hard and carry your team to victory!

Woohoo! Put the heat on that!
You ready for me world?!
Nice! Gotta keep this up.
I know what I want, and I will fight for it!
Yep. Knew that's how it'd go.
There we go! Now, we're\ncookin'!
Tak! They can eat our dust!
We still have some ground to\nmake up!
We're tied. We can still\nfigure this out.
Stay at it! Tighten up!
Focus on scoring! Don't break!
Good one!
Awesome sauce!
Nice, nice!
This can't be happening...
For real?!
Stop 'em!
That's a pass!
Aw, yeah!
Leave this to me!
I'm up!
Time to crash some gates!
This shot will do it!
All according to plan!
Hey, slow poke!
Don't even bother!
Think you can keep up?!
Don't even try that!
Time's up for you!
No openings here!
Hope you're ready!
This point's ours!
Shiny!
Turn on the rockets!
Watch me work!
Have a taste!
I've been saving this one!
There it is!
Time to get down to business!
Now!
You ain't got a prayer!
This is gonna be good!
The ball and I are old friends.
The ball is my friend. And you, my love.
I figured out that technique's weakness.
We're both aiming for the top,\nbut you won't beat me there.
I see the ball's your friend,\ntoo, Tsubasa.
I found your weak spot, Hyuga!
Such fighting spirit!\nI'm impressed, Hyuga!
I outclass you in technique,\nMisaki.
Gah!\nYou make this game fun, Misaki.
Winning takes more than guts,\nMatsuyama.
You stuck to me like glue,\nMatsuyama.
Couldn't read me, could you,\nMisugi?
You read me like a book,\nMisugi.
I beat Schneider.\nDoes that make me...
No wonder they call you the\nYoung Emperor.
I've seen through your magic\ntricks.
I could learn a magic trick or\ntwo.
I'm in control here, Pierre!
You just couldn't make this\neasy, Pierre.
You need more ingenuity,\nNapoleon.
I must have misjudged your\nskills, Napoleon.
You've got a blind spot, Jean!
How do I break the Shield of\nFrance...
You're ougher than I thought,\nKluivoort.
Kluivoort, that was a bit\nmuch!
Your frustration telegraphs\nyour moves, Luciano!
Did Luciano just string me\nalong?!
Can't you keep up, Robson?
Robson.\nYour resolve shows in your play.
Where's your "A" game, Carlos!
You went beyond my\nexpectations, Carlos.
I see through your prodigious\nmoves, Diaz!
I guess they don't call you a\nprodigy for nothing.
I've got your moves figured\nout, Victorino.
I totally got overwhelmed by\nVictorino's energy!
Why so hesitant, Senghor?
Senghor, did you outdo me in\ntechnique?!
I did some analysis of my own,\nRyan.
Ryan just read me like a book!
I thought you were about more\nthan just power, but...
Overpowered, huh?!\nWay to go, Blake.
Is that a Drive Shot?
We meet again.
Sorry. Didn't mean to sneak up on you.
I'm a coach for a youth soccer team,\nand I also look after the facilities here.
You're Japan's 23, <avatar_name>, right?
I saw you play in the previous match.\nYou were spectacular.
Long ago, I coached a boy with unparalleled\nsoccer instincts, and I feel you might be in\nthe same class as him.
Which reminds me, I saw a strong\nSouth American influence in your playstyle.
Where did you learn to play like that?
I see. So you learned from\nthe older Japanese players.
Does that include the Drive Shot from earlier?
But... That shot seemed a little bit\ndifferent from the Drive Shot I remember.\nOr am I just imagining things?
I see. So you're trying\nto learn your senior's shot.
...
You have some great soccer instincts.
Making other players' techniques your\nown is the best way to improve your game.
Keep at it.
If you do, someday your level\nmight catch up to theirs.
Anyway, I'll leave you to your training.\nGood luck!
(It's just like how you mimicked\nmy techniques long ago, Tsubasa)
(Now, it's <avatar_name>'s turn to mimic you.)
(Soccer techniques aren't only learned through\ncoaching. They can be learned this way, too.)







Hi-yah!
Eee-yah!
All me!
Wa-tah!
Oh yeah!
Go! GO!
This is the one!























Captain!
Get 'em!
You're the man now!
Don't fail me!
Ready or not!
Over here! Zheli!
Let the fire burn!
Tsubasa!

Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
Oh, there's so much more in store.
At least, make this fun for me.
The next one will be even better.
So fussy over so little.
Entertain me!
An exquisite dragon... Did you see it?
Xie xie. You showed me such a glorious dragon.
Now then, a reversal of\nfortunes!
Good! Now, let's crush them!
We will still win the day!
Only time keeps the lead from\nus!
We'll take back what's taken!
This should make things\ninteresting.
Splendid!
Tai bang le! Awesome!
Sufficient!
Not very promising...
What just...?!
Stop!
Very good pass!
It's time!
I'll ride this one out!
My turn!
Alright! I've got it!
Much appreciated!
Is that all?
Alright then!
This one's mine!
It's all so clear now!
Ai-yah!
One path!
Too easy!
You're so obvious!
Superspeed Kickback Cannon!
I won't miss this chance!
Superspeed Kickback Cannon fire!
I prepared you a special dish!
Superspeed Kickback Cannon! My dragon ascends!
You disappoint me, Tsubasa.
Tsubasa... Always delivering.
Hah!\nAre you a tiger or a kitten?
Ah, Hyuga! You provide\nsuch a fine challenge.
Your cheap tricks won't\nwork on me, Misaki!
Misaki this is not over!
Matsuyama, you're beneath\nmy notice.
Nipping at my heels,\nare you Matsuyama?
You alright, Misugi?\nYou're getting rusty.
It hurts for now...\nTil next time, Misugi!
I haven't time for you, Nitta.
Oh? This could be more fun\nthan expected.
That's the "Ace Killer"?\nPardon my laughter!
The "Ace Killer"...\nYou'll be next.
Yes!\nStruggle for my entertainment!
Schneider... This will be fun.
At least, you weren't boring,\nHeine.
Don't you mock me, Heine!
And I'd heard such good\nthings about you, Pierre.
Yes! That's what I'm after,\nPierre!
Prepare to be conquered!
You've proved exceptional,\nNapoleon!
Surely you can provide more\namusement than this!
I always repay my debts,\nKluivoort!
Try to take this seriously,\nRusciano!
Soon, you'll be just a\nstepping stone for me!
Try not to disappoint me,\nCarlos.
I never tire of fresh\ncompetition.
Your overconfidence did you\nin, Diaz!
A genius, indeed.\nA new rival to conquer.
Can't keep up, Victorino?
Speed alone is no virtue,\nVictorino.
You have promise!\nBut you aren't ready for me.
Well played, Senghor.
You can't read the flow of my\nspirit, Ryan.
Ryan...\nWhy does he unnerve me so?
Stop holding back, Blake!\nThere must be more!
You don't disappoint,\nI'll give you that.
I saw it. A resplendent dragon.
That was a simple kickback, not the cannon.
A beautiful dragon, spiraling into perfection.
I always repay my debts!
You've been showing remarkable\nimprovement lately, <avatar_name>.
Watching you play, I can tell\nyou've picked up playstyles and mindsets\nfrom all sorts of players.
You've gotten to know so many other players.
That's a great stance to take. Take these\nexperiences and use them to nourish yourself.\nBe insatiable.
You have incredible potential. I hope someday\nyou join Tsubasa in taking Japan's soccer\nto the next level.
Yes, Coach! I'll do my best!
I-I don't know if I can do that...
That's what I was hoping to hear.\nI'm glad I referred you.
Keep at it!
(<avatar_name>, Tsubasa, and the others\nare the dream of soccer fans all over Japan.)
(And since losing my eye made me give up soccer...\nThey're part of my dream, too.)
(Aim for the top and keep on running!)
You're the last person I want to hear\nsaying things like that.
I saw your talent and pushed hard\nfor you to be a rep.
<avatar_name>, Tsubasa, and the others\nare the dream of soccer fans all over Japan.
And since losing my eye made me give up soccer...\nYou're all a part of my dream, too.
If anyone can change soccer in Japan, it's you!\nI believe in you!







Here it goes!
Yallah!
Now!
Fair play!
A gift!
The path is clear!
Rally!























Captain!
I entrust this to you!
Don't let me down!
Heading your way!
Let's get in there!
You with me?
Fight like champions!
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!
Kazuo!
Nitta!
Jito!
Soda!
Ishizaki!
Schneider!
Muller!
Heine!
Pierre!
Napoleon!
Jean!
Kluivoort!
Hernandez!
Rusciano!
Robson!
Carlos!
Keizinho!
Diaz!
Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
But a taste!
They are fools to disregard us!
Don't worry! There's more!
Defenders do more than protect.
I'll never let you guys down!
One point closer to victory!
Follow my lead!
Time to reclaim the field!
Fight as we are,\nand we won't falter!
Nice!\nLet's try to tie this up!
We shall take the winning goal\nas our own!
To lose focus is\nto lose the game!
No way am I giving up\ntil it's over!
Good one!
Exceptional!
Keep it up!
Oh no!
How could this be?
Stop them!
Nice pass!
Got it!
Leave it to me!
Watch me soar!
Hear me, team!
Time to make our push!
Deploy strategy!
Just try and stop me!
Like you could slow me down!
Nice try!
Oh no you don't!
Got you!
As expected!
An opportunity!
I strike!
Received!
Descend upon them!
Now's my chance!
I'll show them!
I may've overestimated you,\nTsubasa.
Ah, Tsubasa...\nThe stories are true.
I've known tigers,\nand you are not one.
A true tiger...\nStripes and all.
Well, that was amusing,\nMisaki.
Y-You beat me in technique?!
Looks like the hot sands beat\nthe cold snows, Matsuyama!
The lands of ice produce\nstrong players...
How do you like my technique,\nMisugi?!
So this is the famous\nMisugi... Such skill!
Even the emperor bows to me!
Ugh... the Young Emperor\nis a mighty foe!
It seems you fell victim\nto your own hubris, Heine.
I see you're not all bluster,\nHeine!
I'd never lose to you, Pierre!
Ngh... I'm glad I got to see\nyour true skill, Pierre.
Roughhousing won't work on me,\nNapoleon.
Napoleon, you're better\nthan I expected.
Not even the Shield of France\ncan stop me!
So this is the famous\nShield of France?
There's a fine line between\nconfidence and arrogance.
It seems you've got\nsome skill, Kluivoort.
Is that the only play\nyou know, Rusciano?
Ugh, I was hanging on by\nthe skin of my teeth.
A puffed chest is just\nhot air, Robson!
So strong! Is his pride\nmore than bluster?
Fun, but a little\ndisappointing, Carlos.
I knew you'd be a worthy foe,\nCarlos!
I won't back down no matter\nwho I face, Diaz!
So this is the prodigy,\nJuan Diaz.
Speed alone is not enough,\nVictorino.
Did I blink?\nNot bad, Victorino.
Why do you tremble, Senghor?
I admire your skill, Senghor.
Ryan, you lack the bearing\nof a king!
He saw through me? You're\nan interesting one, Ryan.
Lift all the weights you want.\nYour fate is sealed, Blake!
Ugh! Such brute strength...
This team is my domain\nand I it's king.
Suddenly, I feel like winning.
I've been waiting\nfor this moment!
Time for Asia to learn\nof Mark Owairan.
Soccer doesn't care about\nnation or wealth.
From what I hear you've gotten to know a lot of\nother players since you came here, <avatar_name>.
I think that's a great thing. Way back when I was\ngoalie, I was always talking with players\nfrom other teams.
Even better, at this tournament you have a fancy\ninterpreting machine that lets you talk with\nplayers from all over the world!
To be honest, I envy you boys. If we only had a\nmachine like this back then...\nI suppose that ship has sailed.
Your generation is full of extremely talented\nboys. You are truly carrying the torch into a\nnew global future of soccer!
You're still at the age where you decide who you\nare. I hope you'll talk and learn from other\nplayers, and expand your potential.
I expect great things from you, <avatar_name>.







Hoo-ah!
Oooh, yeah!
Strike!
Para frente! Push!
Booyah!
Go team!
For Brazil!























Captain!
I believe in you!
Be the man!
Be a champion!
Here we go!
Zróbmy to!
Step up!

Keizinho!
Diaz!
Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
I still need to show the world what I can do!
One step closer to going pro!
I am lord of the score!
Heh, this'll look good on my resume!
I did it! I did it!
Marca! I scored!
Woo! Nice play!
Nothing feels better than\nwinning!
It's not enough!\nI can keep scoring!
I need to score more!
The goals are coming.\nI promise!
If they can score, so can we!
Dangit!\nI'll at least get us to a tie!
Good one!
I like that!
Do that more!
Oh no...!
Uh oh!
Stop them!
Smooth pass!
Got it!
I got the hustle!
Going in!
Clear the way!
That's just rude!
Wham bam!
Here it goes!
Take this!
Watch me soar!
Olé!
Trust me!
GO! GO! GO!
Whatever it takes!
This is it! You're mine!
You can rely on me!
Where do you think Brazilian\nsoccer comes from?
Dangit! I won't lose\nnext time, Tsubasa!
Victory is what feeds me!
Hyuga! I'm just as much\na fighter as you!
Can your technique match up\nto the original?
Misaki...\nWhat incredible technique!
My heart is strong too,\nMatsuyama!
Such strong legs.\nI will remember Matsuyama!
Your blade has grown dull,\nMisugi.
Such fabulous technique!\nMisugi of Japan...
Did you think being gutsy was\nenough?
Oh, you...!\nWell, fair played, Ishizaki.
I'm keeping up with\nSchneider?!
The Emperor...\nOf course, it'd be like this.
I loathe guys like you, Heine!
Darn it... Here I was hoping\nyou were all talk.
I will not let you best me,\nPierre!
Not to you, Pierre,\nanyone but you!
You'll be a great villain\nin my story!
I'll be ready next time,\nNapoleon!
You'll be a great stepping\nstone for my career!
Don't get in my way, Jean!
I beat Kluivoort!\nThis'll look good!
Stop getting in my way,\nKluivoort!
No hard feelings, Rusciano!
Rusciano, we've so much in\ncommon.
I clocked Carlos?!\nI beat Carlos!
Carlos does the number ten\njersey proud.
I beat our rep?! Maybe\nthey'll pick me next time!
So this is why you got\npicked...
That worked on Alberto?!
Captain for the national rep\nteam? Figures.
You don't live up your\nreputation, Diaz.
So this is the famous\nJuan Diaz!
You need to do more than run\naround, Victorino!
S-So fast!\nVictorino you amaze me!
Play from the heart, Senghor!
Wh-What incredible technique!
Didn't bother to analyze me,\nRyan?
How...?!\nSuch perfect movement!
Such brute force... in soccer?
What can one do against such\nphysical tyranny?
I have to go pro ASAP to\nsupport my family.
I'm Pepe from Campo Grande!
Do not wear out my name so casually!
Hyuga! Wakashimazu!\nThere's a letter here for us from Coach Kira!
Coach Kira?
Hand it over, Takeshi.
Kojiro, Wakashimazu, and Takeshi, congrats\non Toho Academy's inaugural victory at the\nAll Japan MS Soccer Tournament.
You have all proved yourselves to be fine\nplayers, and I'm honored to have once had the\nopportunity to pass my wisdom on to you.
But just because you've won the day\ndoesn't mean you should be satisfied.
Your abilities are more than enough to get you\nselected as national representatives of Japan\nfor the International Tournament.
Continue training even harder and let your\nvictory in Japan grow into a worldwide win.
...
That's the next step...\nWe'll be up against the rest of the world.
Ah, that makes me miss Coach Kira's speeches.
Hey, everyone.
Sawaki!
The whole gang's here!
What's this about?
Well, we got a letter from Coach Kira,\nand we were just feeling a mite nostalgic.
Did you guys get a letter from the coach, too?
Huh? You guys, too?
Coach Kira seems to be quite the prolific writer.
What was in your letter, Sawaki?
That the Toho Academy match was a tough break.\nBut that he could tell how badly we wanted to\nwin.
Coach Kira doesn't compliment people often,\nso it was kind of embarrassing really.
You can say that again.
He was such a drill sergeant.
But everyone here learned the fundamentals of\nsoccer from Coach Kira, and we've all come a\nlong way.
So much has happened.\nMan, I could talk about the past all day.
Łoł! Look at the time! We practically did.
It's easy to lose track of time reminiscing.
Alright, then. We should be heading back.
See you guys around!
Tak! Our next match will be in high school!\nHope you're ready for a thrashing!
Bring it on! We'll make you eat those words!
Ha! Well, see you later!
Listening to Hyuga and the others has\nme interested in Coach Kira's coaching.
He's had a huge influence on Toho Academy soccer\nand how the captain and the rest of us play.
It might not be a bad idea to occasionally\nhonor the past a little and practice soccer\nfundamentals like we did back then.
Yeah. And if the first and second-year students\nget the same experience, I think it'll make\nToho Academy soccer even stronger.
Alright, then!\nWe'll all practice fundamentals tomorrow!\nWe'll run drills until we can't run no more!
<avatar_name>! This is gonna be\na hard day of practice! Be ready!







Ha!
Łoł!
Get wrecked!
Look!
Wrah!
Knock 'em out!
Move in!























Cap!
It's on you now!
Pick up the slack!
Gloves up!
Full steam ahead!
Tag team!
Be legendary!
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!
Masao!
Kazuo!
Nitta!
Jito!
Soda!
Ishizaki!
Schneider!
Muller!
Heine!
Pierre!
Napoleon!
Jean!
Kluivoort!
Hernandez!
Rusciano!
Robson!
Carlos!
Keizinho!
Diaz!
Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
I'm Bunnaak and this pitch is my kingdom!
In the ring or on the field, I'm unstoppable!
My kicks were trained for breaking bones!
My body is granite, but you're like dough.
Ha! You can't comprehend the might I command!
Muay Thai has made me a warrior. Remember that!
I will make you understand my strength!
Time for a comeback! Let's lay\n'em out!
Reduce them to dust!
Time for the final round!
Trade blow for blow and watch\n'em crumble!
We don't defend a lead! We\ngrow it!
Contemplate only victory!\nThere is no defeat!
That's the stuff!
Nice!
That's how you do it!
That could've gone better...
What?!
Don't let 'em breathe!
Khawp jai! Good stuff!
Booyah!
Mai pen rai! I got this!
Time for all eight limbs!
I'll show you how this is\nmeant to be played!
Soccer's as much a martial art\nas anything!
I hold the title in this\nstadium!
That it?!
Respect my might!
What was that sad display?
Clear the path!
Order's up!
Coming through!
Time to sling some shin!
Here, I got you this!
Wrecked!
Weakness is unacceptable!
Soccer's a combat sport, just like Muay Thai!
I'll teach fear, as I would in the ring.
Ha! That really all you got,\nTsubasa?
Tch! The stories do you\njustice, Tsubasa!
You're such a kitten, Hyuga!
Well, you are quite the\nsavage tiger after all.
You'll never beat me with that\nwimpy attitude, Misaki!
You're tougher than I thought\nyou were, Misaki.
Eagle or not, I'm making bird\nstew!
You won't be so lucky next\ntime, Matsuyama!
Your body's just not cut out\nfor this, Misugi!
Darn you, Misugi!　How could I\nlose to a weakling like you?
The bigger they are the harder\nthey fall, Jito!
Puttin' time in at the gym,\nJito?
Emperor? Hmph. You aren't fit\nto rule a cow pasture.
I can see how you earned your\ntitle of Emperor.
You call that magic? You\nshould see my sleight of foot.
You trying to make me look\nsilly, Heine?!
Only the strongest survive on\nthe field, Pierre!
You're not as weak as you\nlook, Pierre...
Soccer is a martial art,\nnot a street fight!
If you wanna fight,\nyou got one, Napoleon!
No shield is invincible, Jean!
Jean, you better be ready to\nget torn apart next time!
Ferocity rules the pitch,\nKluivoort.
Kluivoort, you're better than\nthey say.
Takin' you out with the trash,\nRusciano!
You better watch your butt,\nRusciano!
Strength is more than muscle,\nRobson!
Your size won't always save\nyou, Robson.
Number 10 for Brazil?\nMeans nothing.
Not bad, Carlos...
Prodigy or not, you're a bug\nbeneath my heel.
You can certainly juke,\nDiaz...
Victorino, I outpace and\noverpower you.
S-So fast...\nI see the black panther.
You're too meek to be out\nhere, Senghor!
Face me head on, you coward!
Everyone has a plan until they\nget beat, Ryan!
I took you too lightly,\nRyan...
Ha! Love a good clash,\neh Blake?
Blake?!\nI lost to freaking Blake?!
Hyuga.
What, Takeshi?
The head of the club told me\nto give you this note.
A note? For me?
Wonder what it is.
This... This is a Toho Academy soccer\npractice plan from Coach Kitazume!
What?
Amazing... It details how each player should\ntrain after the team changes following the\nnational tournament.
The note also mentions us, <avatar_name>!
So the coach has been watching\neach and everyone of us closely...
...
Takeshi, copy this note and pass it out\nto the first and second-year students.
There are assignments for everyone. Have them\nread it carefully and use it in future practices!
You got it!
(Coach Kitazume, you've put so much talent\nand effort into making Toho Academy stronger.)
(To honor you properly, I'll do everything I can\nin the final to make sure that Toho Academy pulls\nout the win.)
(Alright, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna win the\nJunior Hero League and create a team capable\nof winning nationals after I leave.)
(Accomplishing these two things will repay\nCoach Kitazume for everything he's done for us!)

Do me a favor!
Get in there!
Ready or not...!
Overthrow them!
You ready for this?!

Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Ryan!
Blake!
Azwan!
Hope you're watching closely!
You underestimate a keeper, and you'll regret it!
I feel alive and I got the drive!
This rocket is taking off!
El mundo is going to know my name!
I learned strength in the streets!
Fate has bigger plans for me than poverty!
Sí! This is how we turn it\naround!
I'll take it from here!
Perdón, guys... Let's turn\nthis back around!
Agh! Can't believe I did that.\nScore one for me!
Not backing down no way no\nhow!
Ugh, how could I... Guys, you\nknow what to do!
Nice!
Good one!
Check you out!
No, no...!
What?!
Get 'em!
Sweet pass!
Hey, hey!
Trust me!
Here I go!
This is how we fight!
You all ready for this?!
You can't measure up to us!
Underestimating us was your first mistake!
To me!
It's in the bag!
Here comes the boom!
Watch this!
What a joke!
Not losing today!
Nothing's getting by me!
Do your worst! I can handle it all!
This ball is what will make me a king!
Quit daydreaming! Live in the moment!
Japan. How I've longed to crush you.
Oh no you won't, Tsubasa!\nNot you of all people!
Guess no one in Japan's ever\nfaced a REAL tiger!
Your cheap tricks won't fool\nme, Misaki!
Gotta be more than tough,\nMatsuyama!
You need to go harder than\nthat, Misugi!
Luchadores have way cooler\naerial finishers than that!
You call that speed, Nitta?
That curve shot doesn't\nimpress nobody, Soda!
Thanks for making me look\ngood, Emperor!
Magician? No es cierto!\nWhat a joke!
I hate guys like you the most,\nPierre!
Upset? Come at me again!
How do you have so much\nconfidence?
You made it this far on that,\nRusciano?
Special schooling didn't help\nyou much, did it?
I was expecting more\nfrom Brazil's libero!
Where's the hunger for\nvictory, Diaz?!
All power, no technique,\nVictorino!
Can't play with the big boys?\nScram!
Spirit only takes you so far,\nDiallo!
You seemed confident,\nbut is that all, Ryan?
You can call yourself elite,\nbut it don't mean nothin'!
Nice practice, Tsubasa.
Oh? Who are you?
He's <avatar_name>. He took an interest\nin my playstyle, so we've been practicing\ntogether lately.
Oh, really?
Oh, I should introduce you! This is the team aide\nof the Nankatsu Middle School Soccer Club...
Sanaé Nakazawa. It's a pleasure.
It's an pleasure to meet you!
Did you used to be a tomboy?
Nice to meet you, <avatar_name>.
Huh...?
I mean I guess you could say that.\nHow did you know?
I first met Sanaé in sixth grade.\nShe's super awesome!\nAnd she punches people less than she used to.
But during the tournament in elementary school she\nwore a boys' uniform with a headband and waved\na huge flag while she cheered like a maniac!
Tsubasa!
It's the truth!
Besides, it really helped.
Tsubasa...
I'm so glad you cheered us on that day, Sanaé.
Hey, I brought some lemons and honey. Want some?
Thanks, Sanaé! These are great!
Try some, <avatar_name>. They're the best!
Eating them during practice or between matches\nreally brings you back to 100%!
I'll tell you how to make them!
They're easy to make, easy to eat,\nand perfectly sweet! Just the thing\nto boost your energy!
Okay, you had your snack, <avatar_name>.\nTime to get back to practice!
Good luck, Tsubasa! <avatar_name>!
<avatar_name>, why don't we take a break.
Working hard out there, Tsubasa, <avatar_name>.
Oh, hey Sanaé.
I heard you were practicing today, Tsubasa.\nI've brought some honey lemon. Want one?
Thanks. These are great!
<avatar_name>, you're still new as a regular,\nso you've never had one of these, have you?
She really makes the best honey lemon slices.
Eating them during practice or between matches\nreally brings you back to 100%!
<avatar_name>! I'll have to share my recipe\nwith you, too!
They're easy to make, easy to eat, and perfectly\nsweet! Just the thing to boost your energy!
Please do!
You've been making these a long time?
Will do!
Kumi, next year's manager, said she wanted\nto learn, too, so I'll teach you both later.
I guess?
Well, I wouldn't say super long...
I'd say so.
We first met in sixth grade. She's super awesome!\nAnd she punches people less than she used to.
But during the tournament in elementary school she\nwore a boys' uniform with a headband and waved\na huge flag while she cheered like a maniac!
Tsubasa!
But it's the truth. What's wrong with that?
Besides, it really helped.
Tsubasa...
I'm so glad you cheered us on that day, Sanaé.
Okay, you had your snack, <avatar_name>.\nTime to get back to practice!
Work hard, Tsubasa! <avatar_name>!

Do you see? I am superior!
I don't need your pity!
They didn't pick me to rep Japan...
Feeling regret? Try harder!
Like that? Face it, I'm just better!
World's best? Ha! No one asked ME!
Clear enough for ya, losers?
Like I'd settle for a tie!
Point spread doesn't matter!\nHit 'em hard!
Todo bien! Turn this around!
We won't be tied for long!
We can score just as well\nas they can!
Tch! Whatever, we keep\nscoring til we win!
Way to go!
Nice one!
Not bad!
Oh crud.
Wha...?!
Wall 'em out!
Sweet pass!
Alright!
Believe in me!
Finally!
Move it!
Outta my way!
Coming through!
This is the one!
Dragon Shot!
Dinner's served!
Dragon Shot!
Piping hot!
Dragon... Shot!
No holding back!
Hi-Dragon Shot!
Buckle down!
Have a delicious Hi-Dragon Shot!
I've got this in the bag!
Hi-Dragon Shot coming in hot!
Is that all you got, Tsubasa?
Tch! I knew what I was\nin for...
I win, you lose, Hyuga!
Faaa! I'll get you next time,\nHyuga!
Save your tricks, Misaki!
Tch! I won't be fooled again!
Admirable drive, Matsuyama,\nbut it's not enough!
Why you...\nI'll get you back, Matsuyama!
Take this seriously, Misugi!
Salado! Such movement!
Nitta, you could be\nso much more.
Y-You're fast! Not bad, Nitta!
Your size is impressive, Jito.\nAnd only that.
Well, you can throw\nyour weight around.
What a dull razor.
Ace Killer kills aces.\nMakes sense.
You'll need more grit\nthan that, Ishizaki!
Ishizaki? I lost to Ishizaki?!
So the emperor has no clothes,\nSchneider!
I lost?!\nWell, he is an emperor.
Bout time someone\nshut you up, Heine!
Why you...\nYou're ticking me off, Heine!
This is how you win, Pierre!
Not half bad, Pierre!
You're not my equal, Napoleon!
Tch! Never again, Napoleon!
Like any shield could\nhinder me!
The Shield of France\nis formidable.
You're too cocksure,\nKluivoort!
I'll reduce your heart to ash\nnext time!
Rusciano... I can dig it.
Now, that's a fight!\nA fine match!
That's it?\nI thought you offered more.
Ugh, you're strong, Robson.
The number 10 has fallen\nin Brazil.
Oh, you're going down, Carlos!
You're Diaz? Guess the rumors\nwere just that.
You're better than I heard.\nA true prodigy.
This is the might of Uruguay!
Is this what being a rep\nwould be like?
No cowardice on the field,\nSenghor!
Senghor?! That was Senghor?!
You can't plan for everything,\nRyan!
Ryan got me good...
If you wanna slug it out,\nthen bring it on, Blake!
This Blake guy is a monster!
I'm the real ace striker from Japan!
Uruguay taught me to play soccer.
Why didn't they pick me?!
Matsuyama. <avatar_name>.\nThere's someone here to see you.
Who could it be?
Hi, Matsuyama. Hi, <avatar_name>.
F-Fujisawa! What are you doing here?!
Oh, wait... We're in America. That makes sense...\nYou could have told us first though!
I wanted to surprise you! Looks like it worked.
Oh. It REALLY worked. I can't believe you're here!
It's been a while, Fujisawa!
You remember me?
It has. Good to see you're doing well.
Of course, I do!
I'm surprised you remember him.\nHe's only been in the soccer club since July.
That's exactly why he left such an impression!\nWe didn't have much chance to talk, though.
What's really surprising though is that you've\nbeen chosen to represent Japan after only\nsuch a short time.
Yeah. He really tries his best.\nI can't help but admire him.
You? Now, that's unusual.
Oh, I brought something for you. Try it.
Is this...?
It's Furano Middle School's special stamina drink!\nThe coach's wife taught me how to make it.
Thanks, Fujisawa! I never thought I'd be able to\nget one of these all the way in America!
I used American milk and honey so it might taste\na little different, but it still works!\nDrink up and enjoy practice!
You got it!
Alright, <avatar_name>!\nLet's guzzle these down and get practicing!
See you, Matsuyama! <avatar_name>!\nI'll be sure to watch the next match!
Thanks, Fujisawa!
Hey, Matsuyama! I heard your girlfriend\nfrom Furano paid you a visit?!
Huh?! She's not my g-g-girlfriend!
Right, <avatar_name>?
She just helps out at Furano.
She's totally his girlfriend.
Really? Are you SURE that's all she is?
Wh-What are you talking about?!\nFujisawa isn't my...!
No excuses! Matsuyama!\nI'm gonna give you a talkin' to later!
(That just sounds like your jealous, Jito...)
I gotta earful for you. Just you wait, Matsuyama!
What's a guy to do...?







Ki-yah!
Oh my!
Hyah!
Hah hah!
Right here, right now!
Full speed ahead!
Now's the moment!

Woo! That's it!
All right! We did it, guys!
Thanks for believing in me!
Heh... I did what I had to!
I may not be famous, but I should be!
I'm Shingo Aoi of Nakahara MS! Remember it!
Alright! We're still in this!
Lookin' good!\nKeep it up and we got this!
Okay, could be better,\nbut let's tie it up!
Dangit! Gotta win! Gotta win!
We're still good.\nKeep a cool head!
Now, I'm warmed up!
Awesome!
Right on!
Boom boom boom!
That can't be good!
Uh oh!
Get 'im!
There's a pass!
Well played!
Got it!
On it!
That'll do!
Let's just see!
Overhead Lift!
Raise the curtain!
Lifting Circus!
Sit put for the performance!
Lifting... Circus!
Here's a feast for your eyes!
I've been saving this!
Open wide!
Hoorah!
Dead on!
I really did it!\nI beat Tsubasa!
Ouch... Not bad, Tsubasa,\nbut I'll get you next time!
I beat Hyuga! HYUGA! Woohoo!
I see the distance between us\nand the road ahead.
My techniques always shine\nbrightest, Misaki!
You learned all this\nin France?
I always work the hardest,\nMatsuyama!
I have some catching up to do!
Thanks for the confidence\nboost, Misugi!
Misugi played well...\nI must see what I missed.
How'd you like that, Masao?!
Y-You're good, Masao!
How's that suit ya, Kazuo?!
Y-You're fierce, Kazuo!
I won't lose to a kid my age,\nNitta!
Oof! Guess that's why\nthey picked you, Nitta.
Ah hah! Couldn't track\nme could ya, Jito?
Hey, not fair! You're built\nlike a chimney!
Woo boy, that was scary!\nFine work, Soda.
I mean, this guy faced down\nTsubasa.
Remember last time I beat you,\nIshizaki?
Guess things have changed\nsince last time.
Remember your loss before,\nTakasugi!
Things are different\nthan before.
I crushed you last time, too,\nIzawa!
Things turned out different\ntoday...
I won't lose to someone\nyounger than me!
You're crazy, Takeshi!\nAnd you're younger than me?!
I'm the best player our age,\nSano!
Gah!\nGuess that's why you made rep.
Just like the last time I beat\nyou, Taki!
Taki's playing better\nthan usual...
I'm no slouch, Sorimachi!
Makes sense... I mean,\nhe plays forward for Toho.
You weren't a match for me\nbefore either!
A different day, a different\noutcome, I guess.
I got some skill, right Urabe?
You're the ones who tormented\nNankatsu, right?
I'm good enough to take on\nSchneider, even the world!
So that's Schneider...\nIt's a big world out there.
I won't lose to someone\nthe same age, Heine!
Never guessed the world had\nfolks like Heine in it.
Heh! Maybe I could make it\nin France, too.
Wow, what beautiful technique.\nI should've known.
Not even Napoleon can handle\nmy technique!
Whoa there,\nsettle down Napoleon!
Łoł! I shattered the\nShield of France!
Dang it, Jean!\nI'll get you yet!
Remember the name Shingo Aoi,\nKluivoort!
So that's Kluivoort.\nWorld-class indeed.
I beat Italy's ace?!\nIs this a dream?
So this is Italy's ace...\nI'll be ready next time!
Now, I'm on the international\nscene, Robson!
H-How can anyone kick\nwith so much power?!
I won!\nI beat Brazil's number 10!
Brazil's ace...\nI'm out of my depth.
Non-Stop Shingo Aoi\nDOES NOT... Er, never mind.
Calling oneself a prodigy\ndoesn't mean much.
I got wheels too, you know!
So this is the famous\nsprinter, Victorino!
I've got talent too, Senghor!
Dang it! But I won't lose\nagain, Senghor!
What's the matter?\nNot enough data, Ryan?
Ryan, you are definitely good.
Soccer isn't powerlifting,\nBlake!
Ugh! I'll dance circles around\nyou next time, Blake!
Doesn't the skill gap\never frustrate you guys?
You can't give up on what\nyou love so easily.
My speed and technique are\nbetter than anyone's!
Okay! Let's take a ten minute break!
Man, it's hot again today!
Yeah, after all that training, I'm pooped.
Great work!\nI brought towels for everyone, so grab one!
Nice! Thanks!
I also brought some barley tea,\nso get hydrated and do your best!
Thanks, Aoba!
Alright, if I just get through you...
Not so fast!
Łoł!
Sanada! Are you alright?!
Owww... My ankle took a good hit.
Sanada! I'll take care of it right away!
This should do it. I've applied ice and wrapped\nit up, so you should be able to move again.
You're the best, Aoba.
You're so good at first aid that you'd\nthink you were a health teacher or something.
I want to work in medicine when I grow up,\nso I've studied it a little.
Hmm.
(It'd be in poor taste to ask\n"for whom" she's studying.)
Okay! That's enough practice for now!
"For now," at least.
Yeah, "for now."
Everyone! Give me your used towels and uniforms!\nI'll get them laundered.
You really work hard, Aoba.
We can do that for you.
Thanks, but I'm not working\nnearly as hard as all of you.
It's fine. It's fine. It's what I'm here for.
(Everyone is trying so hard for Jun,\nso I have to do my part for them!)
(Jun is really throwing everything into these\nleague matches. It's up to me to support everyone\nwho is supporting him!)
Alright, I got all the towels, so these are next.
Sure thing!
Now that I think about it, she's been taking\ncare of us ever since the Musashi FC days.
Yeah, she also kept at it during the\ntwo years Misugi was getting treatment.
We should do something nice for her!
What do you propose?
The best thing we could do for her\nwould be to help Misugi succeed!
Yeah, that's pretty much it, isn't it?
Naturally, it'd be to help Misugi succeed, right?
Yeah, I think that would put her over the moon.
After she finishes the laundry and heads home,\nlet's put our practice uniforms back on and\ncontinue practicing into the night.







Graaar!

Ah-ha!

See that? All me!
Scoring is not beyond my scope!
As sure as spring rain!
A rare pleasure!
Was everyone paying attention?
Savage enough for ya?!
We've got them by the tail!
More pressure!
Never say never!
Sorry guys! That one's on me.
They'll never score again!
Sorry guys, I need ya now!
A play for the ages!
I like!
So well done!
That's... undesirable!
Say what?!
Put up a wall!
Fine pass!
Easy there!
I'll handle it!
Turn up the heat!
I smell blood! Get in there!
You ain't seen nothin' yet!
This is how we play!
Don't let them near the net!
I know my job... It's to stop you!
Nothin', and I mean nothin', gets by me!
Never, Tsubasa!
Needs a little more kick\nif ya ask me!
Oh, Misaki, don't\nunderestimate me.
A hard head?\nTry yours on mine, Matsuyama!
Never doubt me, Misugi!
A glorious shot, isn't it?!
I was ready before you woke up\nthis morning!
Not losing to you again, Soda!
I heard you were better than\nthat, Schneider!
Ya can't score with just that,\nPierre!
Anytime, Napoleon!
You shall not pass, Kluivoort!
I win, Rusciano!
Pride doesn't score goals,\nRobson!
Number ten in Brazil's\nsupposed to be a big deal?
Oh, Diaz... If ya only\nknew how lucky you were.
Did ya even try to stop me,\nVictorino?
Where's your grit, Senghor?!
Didn't read me that well,\ndid'ja Ryan?
Nice muscles, Blake!\nRecognize and respect!
A golden leg?\nJust means you're soft.
No goals today!
No points this championship,\nfellas!
Oh, do go easy on me.
Got it. I'll keep checking\nout that Portugal midfielder.
(There are definitely different player\nevaluations to be made when seeing players\nlive as opposed to on video).
(The issue at hand is to find\nwhat can be put to use...)
(Those guys...)
Brazil's practice sure was lively.
We'll need to do better ourselves!
Oh, you're Ishizaki and <avatar_name> from Japan.
Ah, umm, yeah...
And you're Mr. Cardinal!
Japan is really killing it. You're much better\nthan you were back when I saw you practice.
You've been watching us?
I also know about you, Ishizaki.\nYou're a gutsy player to rival any other.
I do like to think of that as my specialty.\nThank you for saying so!
It looks like you've been actively talking\nto a number of players from other countries,\n<avatar_name>.
That's a very good habit to have. I've been\nwaiting for a player like you. Make the most\nof your time and grow from such interactions.
One thing I've been meaning to ask, but why are\ncountries that have been knocked out still on\nthe island?
Oh, that...
This island is my property, but during the\ntournament, the grounds are open to all\nparticipating teams through the finals.
The talented soccer youth of the world almost\nnever get a chance to gather like this, so I want\nit to be an exhilarating experience for all.
The result is that teams stay to\nimprove the quality of their players.
During the tournament, the grounds are opened\nto all participating teams through the finals.
The talented soccer youth of the world almost\nnever get a chance to gather like this, so I want\nit to be an exhilarating experience for all.
That's why, even if teams lose in the\npreliminaries, they can stay and continue\nto improve.
Please... Use this time wisely\nand talk to players from all over.
Thank you so much!
Seems expensive...
We're very grateful!
Naturally, you must to be willing to spend at\nleast this much money if you want to excite the\nworld of international soccer.
You're so generous for the\npresident of such a large company.
The truth is that I dreamed of playing soccer\nwhen I was your age. All I did was play soccer,\nday in and day out.
Oh, really?
I didn't have what it takes to become a pro, so I\nwent into IT instead. I've never lost my love of\nthe beautiful game, however.
I'm looking forward to seeing you play\nwell out there. Best of luck to you.
Thanks!
Ah, sorry. I need to take this call.
I'm afraid I must be going.
Wow! I never thought he'd actually\nremember me of all people!
Alright, <avatar_name>! Let's work harder\nand harder and make a name for ourselves that\neveryone will remember!
Today's practice was fun, <avatar_name>!\nCome by again sometime!
Diaz.
Oh, Coach. What's up?
The guy practicing up until now.\nThat was Japan's number 23, <avatar_name>, right?
Yeah, we've been practicing together lately.\nHe's pretty impressive.
I was watching the practice, too.\nHe's got a wealth of talent to be sure.
If only we could take him\nback to Argentina with us.
Yeah, I think he would hold his own back home.
(If he were to come to Argentina, it'd light a\nfire under all of the country's players and could\ngive life to a great generation of players.)
(To develop that talent... he needs to get\nout into the world as soon as possible.)
(<avatar_name>. I'll remember you.)
Excuse me, <avatar_name>,\nbut would you mind helping me practice?
I know practice just finished,\nso I'm sorry to ask...
The truth is that me, my brother, and\nJito have been working on a new technique.
Masao and Kazuo get on each of my legs\nand launch into the air into a Twin Shot.
We call it the Skylab Twin Shot!
We've been practicing it since the end of\nthe scrims, and it's finally coming together.
So we want to put it to the test.\nCan you kick us a few passes?
Okay, let's get started!
Here we go!
Darn... No good! Our positioning was off!
Jito! Your left leg seems a little weak!
Alright! I got it.
One more time!
Aw, man. So close!
Our positioning was okay,\nbut we were just a little too low!
S'hard to figure the height.\nWe can get it, though!
Hah... We've trained so hard, but I'm not\na kangaroo... I can only jump so much.
Yeah, my legs don't have much juice left!
Okay, then this has gotta be the one. Focus!
You know it!
We're counting on you, too, <avatar_name>!
I'll put all of my focus into this pass!
Make this the one, guys!
Okay, jump!
Up, up and away!
Here we go!
Our Twin Shot!
Woohoo! We finally nailed it!
Tak!
Woohoo... Gah!
A-Are you okay, Tachibana?!
Owww... Well, more or less.
I was able to land okay in practice, but actual\nshots are another story. It'll be hard to use in\na match unless I can get the timing down.
Yeah, and if you get hurt that's\nno good for the team, either.
But hey! We made it work once. We did the thing!
Yeah, you're right.
We still have time. Let's keep at it.
But if we don't perfect it soon,\nthe tournament will be over.
Yeah, we need to pull out all the stops.
But at least for now,\nlet's head back to the dorm.
Thanks for helping us practice, <avatar_name>!
Excuse me, <avatar_name>,\nbut would you mind helping me practice?
I know practice just finished,\nso I'm sorry to ask...
We practiced with Jito around the end of the\nscrimmages. Didn't we mention this before?
We've got a whole three-man combo with Jito now.
Masao and Kazuo get on each of my legs and launch\ninto the air into a Twin Shot.
It's called the Skylab Twin Shot!
Actually, we've been working on it since then,\nbut it's only just now taking shape.

Takeshi! Here comes a running pass!
Got it!
That was okay I guess.
(It's no good. That was too slow.)
(My ideal is the coordination Tsubasa and Misaki\nhad when we were in elementary school.\nI'm not at that level at all.)
(My moves still aren't synced with Hyuga's!)
...
Takeshi, what's bothering you...?
Just keep the fast passes coming! I'll take any\npass you give me and send it right back!
Huh?!
(So that's it. I'm trying too hard to match\nHyuga's movements, and it's keeping us from\ncoordinating!)
(I have to trust Hyuga and speed up.\nKeep moving forward!)
Got it! Let's do one more!
Sure! Bring it on!
Take this!
Wow, Hyuga! Nice shot! But now it's my turn!
Here it comes!
Phew. Not bad, Tsubasa.
What's up, <avatar_name>?
Please, teach me the Neo Drive Shot!
Please, teach me the Neo Tiger Shot!
You... You want to learn the Neo Drive Shot?
It's true that it's a much more powerful shot\nthan the Drive Shot, but it also takes a toll\non your legs and hips.
Your body isn't there yet. If I teach\nit to a first year student, it could...
Don't be rude to <avatar_name>.
Hyuga...
<avatar_name> has played in every match\nso far and does the same practice we do.
I imagine he can handle it.
Not to mention that the upcoming semifinals and\nfinals are bound to be our toughest trials yet.
As good as I may be, we need as many scorers\nas possible if we're gonna win it all.
I'm sure he's thinking the same thing.
<avatar_name>...
Tsubasa!
Let's win it all!
...
...
Okay, <avatar_name>.\nI can sympathize with where you're coming from.
Time for some special training!
Start by trying to find the form that allows for\nthe greatest kicking power while using this\nweighted ball to strengthen your lower body.
Once you've done that, we'll practice using\nthat technique to fire off a Drive Shot!\nAlright, let's get to it!
<avatar_name>! That's no good! You don't\nhave enough power in your kicks yet!
You're not there yet! Your form is still off!
It's getting late. Let's call it a day.
And besides... It took us awhile\nto hone in on the technique, ourselves.
Good point.
Listen, <avatar_name>.
You're going to have to practice a lot more if\nyou want to get the Neo Drive Shot down before\nthe end of the tournament.
Let's practice it every night!\nNaturally, I'll be more than happy to help out!\nI'll help you get to where you need to be.
You're almost there!
Just a little more practice, and you'll have\nthe Neo Drive Shot down. Don't give up now!
Can I really do it?
I'll learn it... No matter what!
Don't lose hope! Believe in yourself!
Tak! That's the spirit!
You've already developed the power\nneeded for the Neo Drive Shot.
All that's left is to let your love of the\ngame take flight like you taught me to!
Believe in your power, your effort,\nand your heart. You've got this!
(<avatar_name> is desperately trying\nto feed off of Tsubasa's enthusiasm.)
(And that means he can do this!)
Okay! Put all your energy into your leg!
Go, <avatar_name>!
I'll fly through the American skies!
Here goes nothing! Neo Drive Shot!
(Th-This sensation...?!)
(Th-This sensation...?!)
Way to go, <avatar_name>!\nThat was a Neo Drive Shot!
Alright! Now, we can both fly the American skies!
Tak! I knew you could do it, <avatar_name>!
We three have nothing to fear from anyone,\nno matter how formidable they may be!
The semifinals and finals are ours!
Tak!
Alright, let's wrap it up.
...
(When <avatar_name> and Tsubasa\nwere shooting earlier...)
(I got the same sensation\nI get when he and I team up.)
(It's possible that all three\nof us could unite together.)
(Maybe there's some thread we share\nthat enables us to pull that shot off!)
You... You want to learn the Neo Tiger Shot?
It's true that it's a much more powerful shot\nthan the Tiger Shot, but it also puts a huge\nburden on your legs and hips.
Your body isn't there yet.\nIf I teach it to a first-year student, I...
I think it's fine, Hyuga.
Tsubasa?
<avatar_name> has played in every match so far\nand does his best in our practices every day.
I'm sure his body is just as strong as ours.
Not to mention that the upcoming semifinals\nand finals are bound to be our toughest trials\nso far.
If we're gonna come out on top,\nwe're gonna need as many scorers as possible.
I'm sure <avatar_name> is thinking the same thing.
<avatar_name>...
Hyuga!
Let's win it all!
...
...
Okay, <avatar_name>.\nI get where you're coming from.
Alright, time to practice. Kick this heavy black\nball around and try to match my shooting speed!
What's wrong, <avatar_name>?! That's not\ngonna be enough to master the tiger shot!
You still have a long way to go, <avatar_name>!\nDo it again!
Hyuga, it's getting late. Let's call it a day.
If you insist.
But listen up, <avatar_name>.
You're going to have to practice a lot more if\nyou want to get the Neo Tiger Shot down before\nthe end of the tournament.
You'll need to practice it every night. Got it?!
You're still not there yet!
The finals are coming up!\nAt this rate, you're not learn it in time!
Maybe it's a lost cause...
I'll learn it... No matter what!
Don't think that way!
Tak! That's the spirit!
You've already developed the power\nneeded for the Neo Tiger Shot.
All that's left is for you believe in\nyour ability to carry the team to victory!
Find your confidence!\nBelieve in your power and effort!
(<avatar_name> is feeding off of Hyuga's\nincredible enthusiasm and is refusing to fail.)
(And in that case, he'll definitely...!)
Alright! Put some soul into that leg of yours!\nLet's do this!
Go, <avatar_name>!
Suck on this!
Neo Tiger Shot!
(Th-This sensation...?!)
(Th-This sensation...?!)
You did it, <avatar_name>!\nThat was a Neo Tiger Shot!
You're a real striker now!
I knew you could do it!
The three have nothing to fear from anyone,\nno matter how tough they are!
The semifinals and finals are ours!
Tak!
We should head back. Let's skedaddle.
...
(When <avatar_name> and Hyuga\nwere shooting earlier...)
(I got the same sensation\nI get when I'm shooting with Hyuga.)
(It's possible that all three\nof us share that bond.)
(Maybe only people of the same heart\nand mind can make that shot work together!)
What was that?! Say it again!
How many times do I have to tell you? Your\nshooting is disgusting. And not in a good way.
You're sacrificing control for power.\nYou're never going to score a goal that way.
What are you on about? The reason you\nmanaged a goal in the match against Brazil...
...is because the power of my Blake Shot\nabsolutely devastated the goalkeeper!
If you ask me, your Ryan Shot isn't powerful\nenough! Even a noodle-armed goalie would have\nno problem knocking it away!
That's why I don't even give them the chance to\ntouch the ball. You're the last person who should\nbe lecturing me on this.
Come again?!
<avatar_name>... Sorry you had to see that.
Do you mind, <avatar_name>? I'd like\nto ask you about which of us is right?
Fine by me.
Which do you think is more important\nwhen shooting? Power or control?
Power.
Control.
I knew it! I knew you'd understand!
Ugh... I never took you to be a meathead.
Well, obviously.\nAnyone with half a brain knows that.
Tch, you're no fun at all.
Power and control...
Wouldn't the strongest be\na combination of Ryan and Blake?
What do you mean by that?
I'm... I'm not really sure myself.
Stone is right. Ideally, you'd want to have both\npower and control, but even with my many talents,\nthat's no easy task.
Yeah... I could see that.
Yeah, my goal is to have the strongest shot in\nthe world, but I still have work to do...
Let's go, Carlos!
C'mon!
Yes! That was perfect!
Yeah.
<avatar_name>...
Coming to meet the opponent you're about\nto face in the finals... That's so like you.
I know why you're here.
It's about our shot, right?
This Double Force Shot added power to\nmy shot and sharpness to Carlos's shot.
Only the two of us can do it.\nIt's the most powerful shot there is.
I can add even more power to it.
I can make it even better.
You... You underestimate me.
Hmph. You really think so?
Well, I don't detect any sarcasm.
(It's true that <avatar_name> might\nbe able to pull this shot off...)
(But there's no point thinking about it.\nIt has nothing to do with the coming match.)
I can't deny that you might be\nable to perform the shot.\nLet's give it a try after the finals are over.
Well then, let's get back to the dorm.
You should get back, too. You wouldn't\nwant to burn out ahead of the finals.
Just be ready to lose.
Sorry about grabbing you right at\nthe end of practice, <avatar_name>.
We were actually just thinking that you might\nbe able to pull off our Skylab Twin Shot.
So we talked it over and decided\nwe'd try to teach it to you!
If you join the three of us, it'll give us\neven more shooting options during matches.
And if we do that, we'll be that much\ncloser to being the best in the world!
I'm up for it!
You... You really think I can do it?
Good answer! Zróbmy to!
What are you talking about? I believe you can!\nAnd there's no way I'm wrong!
Alright, then! Let's get started!
That was no good! Your timing is off!
The breathing of the jumpers and\nnon-jumper needs to be in sync!
You're still not there yet! Again!
Okay! That was better than before!
Put more power into your kicking leg!
Alright, one more time!
Well done! Well done, <avatar_name>!
Wow! I knew you could do it!\nYou're really something!
With our power, Japan will win it all for sure!
The next match is the finals, and the four\nof us are gonna bring it home for Japan!
Hey, <avatar_name>, let's go practice again today!
Oh, you're going to practice?
Then, we'll come with you.
Yeah, the more the merrier!
Hey, <avatar_name>, let's go practice again today!
Oh, you're going to practice?
Then, we'll come with you.
The more the merrier, right?
Hey, <avatar_name>, let's go practice again today!
You two are going to practice together?
Then, we'll tag along!
The more the merrier, right?
Phew, what a workout.
As always, the Shutetsu Trio is unstoppable!
Yeah, when we put our strengths\ntogether we can't be outdone!
Hmph! You sure about that?
Hey, aren't you...
You're from the Netherlands, right?\nWhat're you three doing here?
We got some free time, so we\nfigured we'd train with <avatar_name>.
We got some free time, right?\nSo I figured, why not train with <avatar_name>.
Our schedule opened up, so I thought I'd like\nto spend some time kicking the ball around with\n<avatar_name>.
So what'd you mean by what you said earlier?
Exactly what it sounded like.
Yeah, you call yourselves the\nultimate combination? Don't make me laugh.
What?!
Okay, that does it! Let's settle this!\nUs three versus you three!
I guess you'll never understand\nwithout firsthand experience...
Fine then. We'll have to beat\nit into you with our skills.
Bring it on! We're not afraid of you!
Ugh!
Our combo...
Didn't work at all!
A bit clearer now?
You guys weren't as bad\nas I was expecting though.
Yeah, your coordination is smooth as silk.
Then, what are they missing?
Will they ever be as good as you?
Hmm... Well, since they're your teammates,\nI guess I can tell you.
Who knows? But they can definitely\nget better than they are now.
F-For real?!
Please! Tell us what we're doing wrong!
We want to get better! Way better!
If you're gonna go so far as to grovel,\nI guess we could give you some advice.
Your coordination is excellent, but you\nonly do the same few things over and over.\nIt's easy to guess what you're going for.
So use your heads and come up\nwith more plays to choose from!
You're one to talk, Kaiser.
Sh-Shut up!
More plays, huh?
To add to your repertoire of team plays, each\nof you needs to become more versatile, as well.
Lucky for you, you've got us to give\nyou a little coaching. How 'bout it?
Yeah, you get more outta soccer\nthe better your rivals are.
That'd be great!
Thanks!
Izawa! You dribble and shoot all right,\nbut what're you best at?
Best at? Umm... Headers, I guess.\nI never lose up in the air.
Gotcha. Then post plays and\nfeints should work well for you.
Taki! Looks like you're good at pushing up the\nsidelines, but you can't just go full tilt all\nthe time.
Unless you mix up the speed of your dribble,\nthe defense will pick up on your timing,\nand then it's all over.
I don't remember you doing that\nin the match just now though, Kaiser.
Ha ha! When you're as fast as me,\nyou can just shake them off!
Kisugi! You can't just take a rushed\nshot at the first chance you see.
If the goalie can start to react to your\nlocation, he's likely to stop it.\nYou should think how to move opposite to him.
So treat every shot like a penalty kick?
That's not a bad way to think of it.
Klismann, Kaiser, Lensenblink...\nSeriously, thank you guys.
Don't mention it.\nWe learned a lot from teaching you, too.
I hope we get to play each other again someday!
Tak! Not that you guys will stand a chance.
Don't be so sure! We always repay our debts!
You're certainly welcome to try.\nWell, I look forward to it either way.
Anyway, it's about time for us to head back.\nGood luck with your next match!
See ya!
You should join in next time, <avatar_name>.\nLater.
You know <avatar_name>, I always thought Japan\nwas big, but man, the world is REALLY big.
I was shocked by Jito's power when he plowed\nright through us back in the match against\nHirado MS at Nationals, but...
In the scrim against America, Blake dealt with\nJito like a disobedient pet. That's when I\nrealized that the world is bigger than I thought.
That's why, as a defender on Japan's top team,\nI need to grow. I need to be someone who can\ncarry the weight of a nation.
But... This is gonna sound pathetic,\nbut I don't even know where to start.
I was hoping I'd find some inspiration now\nthat we're here with the rest of the world.
You got any good ideas, <avatar_name>?
I know a defender who leads a country...
It's time to see the rest of the world.
Really?! How'd you meet him?
Whatever, introduce me!
Sure, I'd love to, but how?
Do you know anyone who'd train with us?\nIf you do, I'd love to meet them!
I see. So that's why you're here.
But England didn't even make it past the prelims.\nHonestly, I know exactly what you mean about\nsuddenly realizing how big the world is.
Besides, I saw Japan's power during the scrim.\nYou're representing Japan, too, Takasugi,\nso I'm sure you're plenty strong already.
No, from what I've seen your power\ndefense is definitely world-class, Robson.
So please, if you're willing,\nhelp me with my training!
Hasn't Japan been advancing pretty steadily?\nYou're part of that amazing team, too, Takasugi,\nso I'm sure you're plenty strong already.
No, I feel like I still don't\nmeasure up to the level of play here.
But <avatar_name> says your power defense is\nworld-class! Please, can you teach me any tricks?
Alright. I can't turn down someone with\nthat kinda enthusiasm for the game.
So, shall we begin?
First, I want to see what you've got, Takasugi.\nGive me your best shoulder charge, okay?
Huh? Are you sure...?
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
Come on, look at me. If you're gonna move me,\nyou're gonna hafta give it some oomph!
Okay, one last time!
Gah, you're tough!\nFeels like I'm running into a wall.
I had a notion things would go something like\nthis. I don't think you have real control over\nyour own body strength.
Wh-What do you mean?
To put it simply, you're not good at using your\nbody as a whole. You've got the muscles, but you\nlack the skill to make yourself into a hammer.
You've always been bigger than\neveryone around you, haven't you?
Y-Yeah. Why?
I can sympathize. It was like that for me before,\ntoo. You need to take on guys your own size to\nlearn how to hit like a real sledgehammer.
Hmm, maybe you're right. Up until Jito, I never\nreally went up against anyone as strong as me.
Well, you can't help it if you never got\nthe chance. But it's never too late to learn.
I don't know if it'll suit a guy your size,\nbut I've got my own training methods.\nCare to give 'em a go?
Yes, absolutely!
Ngh! How about that?!
You're doing amazing, Takasugi!\nYou're really pickin' it up fast!
I'm as surprised as you. I'm using my body in\nways I never have before. I know I'm just getting\nstarted, but I feel a massive change already.
That's because you've got skill, man.\nYou should thank your mom and dad for your genes.\nAnd remember to stay confident.
Keep this up and you'll show even better results.
But all we've done so far is basic bodybuilding\nstuff. Throw in some actual technique,\nand you could be better than me.
Technique? Like what?
Say we both hit each other head-on\nwith everything we got, right now.\nI'd almost definitely bowl you over, right?
Yes, that is abundantly clear to me.
But if I were only giving it seventy percent\nand you still gave hundred percent,\nyou'd probably win.
So even if the other guy is stronger,\nas long as you find the right time to strike,\nthey can't use their full strength. You can win.
Oh, I get it.
That's easier said than done though. Even I\ncan't always get the pieces to all come together.
Still, train that mental muscle.\nIt may give you the edge you need.
Yeah, thank you!
We'll need your help too, <avatar_name>.
Okay Takasugi, so when he's got the ball...
Good, looks like you're getting the hang of it.\nThere's not much time, but I think you'll have\nthis down in time to use it in the tourney.
*pant* This training's pretty tough.\nBut I think it'll pay dividends in the end.
It will. Believe you me.
But seeing you two trying so hard makes\nme feel like I need to step it up, too.
Thank you, Robson. I wonder if this training\nwill help me out with my throw-ins, as well.
Are you good at long throws, Takasugi?
Yeah, ever since elementary I've\neven been using them to center the ball.
That's incredible! Would you mind\nteaching me how to do that next time?
Sure thing. It's the least I could do.
Ha ha ha! This could be the start of\na whole new strategy for England.
I just hope it'll help.
I'll be sure to use what you taught me, Robson!\nI'm gonna become immoveable on defense!
I look forward to the day we\ncan cross cleats in a real match.
Same here!
Thanks for today, you two.\nYou guys've really inspired me.
I should be thanking you.
And you too, <avatar_name>. We would never\nhave met if not for your timely intervention.
Seriously. Thanks, <avatar_name>.
Remember, your training's not over Takasugi.\nAnd I'll join in when I can. Oh, and try to\nwin the championship while you're at it! Ha ha!
Until next time!
Thanks again, Robson!
Hmm...
<avatar_name>, huh?
I'm here if you need to talk.
Sorimachi?! Worrying about something?!
Hah... Thanks.
But I dunno how to feel about laying my\ntroubles at the feet of a first-year student...\nWell, couldn't hurt, I guess.
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?
Oh... You're trying to cheer me up, aren't you?
Thanks, man.\nIt couldn't hurt to talk to you, I guess.
See, all our forwards here are so unique.
Hyuga's got his power, Nitta's got his speed,\nTaki's got his sideline dribbling, and Kisugi's\ngood at making plays right in front of the goal.
And while they're technically midfielders,\nSano and the Tachibana brothers can definitely\nput in work as forwards.
Plenty of our midfielders and\ndefenders can use longshots.
I'm surrounded by players like that.\nSo this whole time, I've been trying to figure\nout what my own place is in all this.
And the answer I came up with is\n"a forward who creates openings up front."
The job of a forward isn't just to score points.\nHelping your teammates score is just as\nimportant. In other words, post plays.
Even back at Toho Academy I sometimes made the\ndeciding pass to Hyuga or Wakashimazu to turn\ninto a goal. I've done this job before.
But I still don't have nearly enough skill or\nexperience to specialize in that amidst these\nworld-class players we're up against.
I wish I could get some advice from someone, but\nthe coach has to watch over the whole team, so\nit's not like he has time to coach me personally.
Man, it's so frustrating when I want to get\nbetter, but I don't know where to turn...
Oh, if it isn't <avatar_name>!
How goes it?
...
I see. So you came to us for help?
Hey Schester, are you free this afternoon?
I was right about to ask you the same thing.
You'll really help me...?\nThen... can you teach me about post plays?
How can I say no when <avatar_name> asking?
Can't say I don't enjoy the odd sort of celebrity\nof being asked for help by players from other\ncountries.
Anyway, we'll teach you what we can.
Thanks, you guys.
Okay, let's start by explaining\nwhat you need to make post plays.
We're starting from there?
Naturally. The better you understand the purpose\nunderlying your play, the easier it is to set\nyourself up to succeed.
Okay, I'm listening.
The first most important thing is to receive the\nball out front. You have to be able to trap a\nball that a teammate lofts to you.
Your main job is to stay up front and create\nopportunities for your teammates to score, but\ndon't forget to take your own shots when you can.
A player who never takes a shot is one who\nthe defense isn't scared to let have the ball,\nwhich means you can't draw their attention.
Take Margus. He's Germany's post player, but he's\nalso got a mean header. They can't let him run\nfree without risking him popping it in.
So obviously the defense sticks to him.\nThat gives everyone else that much more space\nto breathe and work with.
Point is, you need to let your opponents know\nyou're dangerous. That's an important part of\nbeing a post player.
Makes sense.
Okay, next up I'll play post while Sorimachi and\n<avatar_name> act as defense and try to stop me.
Huh?
What better way to learn what to do than to\nsee for yourself what defenders hate most?
Exactly.
Got it. Zróbmy to!
Go, Margus!
Whenever you're ready!
Here!
Ugh!
I couldn't get off the ground properly...
Was that the trick just now?
Correct. It's because I leaned my\nbody weight toward you while jumping.
Yup. I get in the way of my opponent's jump by\nleaning my body weight toward them on takeoff.
It works on the ground, too.
You can do more than just plant your feet to stop\nthem from taking the ball. You can lean into them\nto interfere with their movements.
Personally, I specialize in aerial stuff,\nso there's not much I can tell you about how\nto do it on the ground.
Okay, now you try it, Sorimachi!
Margus and <avatar_name> can be the defense.
Sure!
Okay, one more time Sorimachi!
Yeah, now you're getting it!
There!
I... I did it!
That was great, Sorimachi.\nYou really pinned me down!
Alright, that's step one. Now, you have to do\nthat while also passing the ball to where it\nneeds to go.
This is tough...
Were it easy everyone would do it.
You want to stop there, then?
No way! Keep it coming!
That's more like it. Then, let's proceed!
This time it'll be you and Margus, one on one.\nYour mission is to pass it up to <avatar_name>,\nwho'll be charging the goal!
Let's do it!
It's about time to wrap this up.\nOne last time, Sorimachi!
You got it! Bring it on!
There!
I did it... I did it!
Great job, Sorimachi!
Outstanding! I can't believe you made it on the\nvery last try. Guess you're the type who works\nbest when the pressure is on!
Seriously, thanks for everything you two.
Same here.\nTeaching others helps us learn, as well.
Today, we covered leaning into your opponent,\nbut there are also post plays where you want to\nslip away from the defenders for a moment.
And countless other scenarios, strategies,\ntechniques, and so on. So if you ever have\nany questions, feel free to ask.
Yeah, we're not big on secrets.
I still don't get it...\nWhy are you helping me so much?
To be honest, part of me\nwants you guys to avenge us.
Yeah, it'd be nice if you\ncrushed Brazil into a fine putty.
Schester... Margus...
Alright, just leave it to us! When I get my shot,\nI'll use what you taught me and take 'em down!
We're counting on you two!
Good luck!
To be honest, part of me\nwants you guys to avenge us.
Yeah, it'd be nice if you\ncrushed America into a fine putty.
Schester... Margus...
Alright, just leave it to us! When I get my shot,\nI'll use what you taught me and take 'em down!
We're counting on you two!
Good luck!
Even though we'll be facing\neach other before long...
That's true. But if we rejected you for a reason\nlike that, it just wouldn't be as much fun.
And there you have it. Nothing makes soccer\nmore enjoyable than having worthy rivals!
Schester... Margus...
See you two in the finals,\nand let's make it one to remember!
We're going to win, of course!
Ha ha, not if we can help it!
Be seeing you!
Even though we might be on opposite\nends of the field down the road...
That's true. But if we rejected you for a reason\nlike that, it just wouldn't be as much fun.
And there you have it. Nothing makes soccer\nmore enjoyable than having worthy rivals!
Schester... Margus...
Anyway, see you two in the finals!
Later!
Argh! Why can't I catch it?!
It's not like you to get so upset.
That one wasn't your fault.
Sorry about that.\nI'm just disappointed in myself.
Yeah, I guess...
(No offense <avatar_name>, but Wakabayashi or\nWakashimazu would've been able to catch that.)
I've said this before, but I really look up to\nWakabayashi. So I've been working my butt off\nto narrow the gap between us.
But when we practice together, I can tell the\ndifference I'm not one bit closer to him.\nIf anything, we're even further apart now.
I... It makes me feel so pathetic.
I've been trying my best in my own way,\nbut it's like it hasn't helped at all!\nIt's so frustrating!
Back in the scrim with Germany, their\ntwo aces were scoring on me left and right.
And I feel like I've not\nimproved at all since then!
Hey <avatar_name>. What brings you here?
Huh?!
You're late, <avatar_name>.\nEveryone else is already...
Y-You're Zino Hernandez!
Hey, there. So you're Morisaki?
Actually, <avatar_name> asked me\nto give you a little coaching.
Who in the what now?!
Looks like you're splitting up\nfor a practice match, though.\nThat's cool, I'll just observe for now.
O-Okay! Thank you!
I got a good look at you out there, Morisaki.
So what'd you think?
To put it a bluntly, you've got a lot to work on.
I knew it...
You let two half field goals get by you from\nnumber seven and number five, but you should've\nbeen able to stop both of them.
Take seven's curve shot. If you look closely at\nits rotation, you should be able to tell where\nit'll go.
As for five's power shot, if you'd braced\nyourself properly right in its path,\nit wouldn't have been able to drive you back.
Ugh...
Plus, it felt like you weren't\ngiving your defense much direction.
Goalies are the furthest back, giving them the\nbest view of the field. You need to direct your\ndefense and make call outs.
Yeah...
I know this sounds harsh, but I'm telling you\nthis because if you can fix these problems,\nyou'll be a much more competent keeper.
Yeah... You're right!
First, you need to watch both your teammates and\nyour opponents more closely. You need to predict\nboth their next play and the one after that.
Say an opponent has the ball. Think about what\nthat player is good at. What's their go-to move.
If it's passing, watch the other players and\nthink about who they'll pass it to and where\nthe attack will come from.
If it's shooting, try to remember what kind of\nshots they use, and when they look like they're\nabout to fire, predict where it'll go.
That's also when you should shift the defense\naround to limit their options and make it easier\nto predict what will happen.
I mean...\nI get all that, but it's easier said than done.
Who said anything about easy? But you have to\ndo it if you want to be a world-class goalie.
You can't just wait for them to shoot\nand rely on pure reflexes to stop it.\nIt doesn't work like that.
Oh...
I'm not saying you have to be perfect right away.\nJust keep it in mind, take one thing at a time,\nand eventually you'll build up the skills.
One thing at a time...
Exactly. You won't turn into me overnight.\nBut keep at it, little by little, and you'll\nget there.
I mean, it might sound like I'm talking down to\nyou, but I'm still a novice, too. I just keep at\nit every day, little by little.
Also, as for special techniques...\nI guess we're out of time. Come back after dinner,\nand I'll show you a little more.
Absolutely! I will! Thanks!
Okay, bring it <avatar_name>!
Alright! I caught it perfectly!
That was good. If you predict the trajectory from\nwhere they point their toes on their pivot leg,\nyour odds of stopping a penalty shot go way up.
It works the same in the middle of a game, too.\nWork on predicting where they'll shoot, and as\nyou get good at it, you'll stop more shots.
That said, there are also players who know that\nand intentionally point their foot the opposite\ndirection to mislead you.
That's why you can't forget to take into\naccount their personality and skill set.
Thank you, Hernandez.\nI really learned a lot today.
You can even catch the Fire Shot now!
Not even Schneider can scare you now!
Bwuh?! The Fire Shot?!\nNot even Wakashimazu can catch that!
Yeah, he got me good with that just last year.
W-Well, I dunno 'bout that...
Schneider's definitely an amazing player.\nHe's even tied up a match against me once with\na last second goal.
Which reminds me,\nI heard something from <avatar_name>.
He said you were feeling really\nfrustrated after the scrimmage with Germany.
But isn't that just perfect? You'll get\nyour chance to pay them back in the finals!
Yeah, that's true... Though I think today has\ngiven me a lot to focus on and redirect my\nenergy.
Which reminds me, I heard from <avatar_name> that\nyou were feeling frustrated after the scrimmage\nwith Germany.
It's too bad you couldn't get your revenge this\ntournament, but I'm sure you'll get your chance.
Yeah... And until then,\nI'll train like my life depends on it!
I heard from <avatar_name> that you were feeling\nreally frustrated after the scrimmage with\nGermany.
Keep advancing and you'll probably run\ninto them again. Every dog has his day.
Yeah, you're right... I'll stay driven.
I heard from <avatar_name> that you were feeling\nreally frustrated after the scrimmage with\nGermany.
I'd love to give you a chance to get your\nrevenge, but looks like I've got first shot. I've\ngot my own score to settle with Schneider anyway.
But I thought I heard that\nKluivoort's shot broke your right arm?
Yeah, that's true.
But I did that to protect Italy's goal.\nThat's just how much I want this.
Hernandez...
Let's see each other in the finals, Morisaki!
Absolutely! And when we do,\nlet's have a good match!
Anyway, it's about time for me to head back to\nthe dorms. See you guys later! Arrivederci!
Thanks again!
And thank you so much, <avatar_name>,\nfor convincing Hernandez to coach me.
You've done so much for me.\nI won't let it go to waste.
We'll become the world's best together!
Hey <avatar_name>, you know that\nI do capoeira, right? The martial art?
Since my great-grandpa's from Japan, I've always\nbeen really into martial arts and bushido and\nstuff. You know, karate and judo and all that.
Hey <avatar_name>, did you know I do capoeira?\nIt's a traditional Brazilian martial art.
Since my great-grandpa's from Japan, I've always\nbeen really into martial arts and bushido and\nstuff. You know, karate and judo and all that.
So I wanted to ask, is there anyone on the\nJapanese team who's good that at that kinda\nthing? Or even just knows a lot about it?
It'd be so awesome to talk about it with someone.\nOr even like, get a demonstration?\nHeck, if you're good at it that'd be crazy!
I know just the person.
If you mean someone good at fighting...
Huh? A black belt in karate?\nAnd he's your goalie?!
So could you, like, introduce me? I really\nwanna get to know this guy! How about now?
N-Not exactly... I mean, it'd be cool if they're\nskilled too, but I meant more like the bushido\nspirit. That's what I'm into.
Fighting is, like, completely different.\nI'd hoped you'd know someone since its origins\nare in Japan, but...
Wait... are those martial arts moves?\nC'mon, let's go talk to him!
Yo, <avatar_name>. And you're... Brazil's goalie,\nright? Here to practice together?
Yo, <avatar_name>. And who's that with you?
Nice to meet you! I'm Brazil's goalie, Keizinho!
Y-Yeah, the pleasure's mine.
So, did you need something?
I see, so that's the deal.
Well, I'm fine with it if you are, Keizinho.
Come on, he asked you about martial arts, and\nyou didn't even mention me? I'm a black belt in\nkarate, remember?
Anyway, I'd love to chat martial arts, Keizinho.
Awesome! I have so much to ask you!
I see... capoeira seems to have\nsome pretty unique movements.
It's so interesting to learn about\nother martial arts from around the world.
Same here! The way karate teaches you to train\nyour mind, body, and movements in harmony is so\ncool! I'm so in awe!
Thanks. I'm glad to hear that.
Plus, as a goalie I get a lot of use out of\nmy Wakado Style karate when making saves.
I knew it! I could tell from watching you\npractice! I'd love to use that stuff for\nreference, but could you clue me in?
I was trying out a bunch of different ways to\nstop a power shot. Like, using the recoil from\na triangle jump or using a karate chop.
It was so frustrating getting blown away by\nBlake's shot in the scrimmage with America.
Yeah, as a goalie I know exactly what you mean.\nBlake's shots are just...\nThey can be disheartening.
Yeah, I've only seen his shots from off the\nfield, but I can still tell how nuts they are.
I didn't have the strength to stop a power shot\nback then, so I've been training for our next\nencounter.
Gotcha... Then, I'll help!
Are you sure?\nI mean, are we not on opposing teams?
Who cares about that? Why can't we be buddies,\nwho love soccer and martial arts?
Thanks, Keizinho. You're a good guy.
Anyway, let's get started!\nYou bring the heat, <avatar_name>!
I see, so that's how you use your lower body.
Yeah. It's something we do in capoeira.\nIt should definitely help you stay planted.
With all that jumping around you do, I know your\nlegs are strong enough for it. The rest is just\ndown to putting some pieces together.
Now, I bet you can even\ntake on the Blake Shot head on!
Thanks, Keizinho. With this, my fist will be able\nto stop even the world's most powerful shots!
"Stop"? C'mon now! You're selling yourself short.\nWhy don't you SMASH them, instead?
Yeah. I like that idea.
I might have gotten a bit passive\nwhen it comes to power shots.
What I really needed was a more aggressive\nattitude! I'll make sure my fists stop any shot,\nno matter how ferocious!
Now, that's the spirit, Wakashimazu!
Ah, it's getting late!\nBetter had back to the dorm!
Sorry, Keizinho.\nI didn't mean to take up so much of your time.
Its all good! I was having so much fun I lost\ntrack of time. It'd be great to make a game of\nit next chance we get.
If I get to Japan,\nit'd be nice to visit your dojo, as well.\nI hope I wouldn't be imposing too much!
Of course not. You're always welcome.
Thank you, too, <avatar_name>! It was great\nmeeting you! I hope to see you both again!
I want to thank you as well, <avatar_name>.\nI think I was very fortunate to cross paths\nwith you.
Next time, I'll be using what I gleaned from\ntoday's practice. Be ready, <avatar_name>.
Alright, that's it for running today...
Oddly, I only ever seem to run lately\nwhen you're here, <avatar_name>.
Hey, Takeshi! <avatar_name>!
Out for a run?
Ah, Nitta! Sano! Yeah we are.
Phew... Let's rest here, Sano.
Yeah...
You two have been working a\nlot together lately, haven't you?
Wouldn't the same apply to the two of you?
Ha! True enough.
Being the same age seems\nto make everything easier.
Agreed. Not that I have anything\nagainst my seniors, mind you.
They are pretty incredible, though.
Tsubasa really carries the team. Ishizaki and\nUrabe get everyone fired up.\nJito is... Well... Jito.
And Matsuyama really looks after\nall of the younger players.
Misugi often observes our practices and\ngives us advice that's really on point.
Hyuga teaches us what it really means to "win."
In games, too, Tsubasa and the rest have carried\nus so far. They're really something, aren't they?
But getting carried isn't that much fun, either.
That's why I want to show them how hungry we are.
Huh?
Eh?
Well said, <avatar_name>.
Yeah, I can't say I'd feel all that great about\nthe older players carrying us all the way to\nnumber one without being able to lend a hand.
Then, let's get out and practice!
Tak! I hear that!
We'll not only catch up to them!\nWe'll surpass them!
Alright, that's it for running today...
Oddly, I only ever seem to run with you lately,\n<avatar_name>.

Masao and Kazuo really look out for us!
Although, sometimes it's hard to tell them apart.
In games, too, Tsubasa and the rest have carried\nus so far. They're really something, aren't they?
But getting carried isn't that much fun,\neither.
That's why I want to show them how\nhungry we are.
Wha...?
Wha...?
Well said, <avatar_name>.
Yeah, I can't say I'd feel all that great about\nthe older players carrying us all the way to\nnumber one without being able to lend a hand.

Tsubasa really carries the team. Ishizaki gets\neveryone fired up. Jito is... Well... Jito.
I used to think he'd be a scary dude,\nbut he's more like the life of the party.
For sure.
The older guys are all great. Once the match\nstarts, though, it's like they power up.
They've carried us so far rallying around Tsubasa.\nThey're really something, aren't they?

Matsuyama does so much and still takes the time to\nworry about us. Ishizaki gets everyone fired up...
And Jito is... Well... Jito.
And Matsuyama really looks after\nall of the younger players.
Misugi often observes our practices and\ngives us advice that's really on point.
Hyuga teaches us what it really means to "win."
In games, too, Tsubasa and the rest have carried\nus so far. They're really something, aren't they?
Misugi always seems to deliver the right words and\nthe right plays. Hyuga really carries the team on\nhis shoulders.
And Tsubasa always goes all out. Not only\nin actual matches but during practice, too.
Anytime I see Tsubasa play,\nI get the urge to try and play the way he does.
We're really lucky to have such talented\nupperclassmen to learn from.
But getting carried isn't that much fun, either.
That's why I want to show them how hungry we are.

Tak! I hear that!
We'll not only catch up to them!\nWe'll surpass them!
*pant* Hey, let's rest a moment.
I... I agree...
Don't start slacking now, Ishizaki!
What?! You guys already out of breath?
We're just getting warmed up and you're\nalready complaining? Where are your guts?
Yeah, Ishizaki. Where's the gutsiness you've\nbeen blabbing about since elementary school?
Shut up! I've been training for hours, man.
Haha! If it's soccer we're talking about,\nI can go all day long.
Hahaha. Jeez. You haven't changed one lick since\nelementary school. I know we've known each other\na while, but boy is it ever true.
You haven't changed since the day we met, either,\nIshizaki. Though you've gotten a whole lot better\nat soccer.
Of course!\nIt'd be awfully disconcerting if I'd not.
That being said, you were already\nimpressive when we first met.
I was blown away when you kicked the ball all the\nway to Wakabayashi's house from the hill on the\nedge of town.
I remember that now... I wanted to see just\nhow far I could sail a ball off the top.
I was shocked that you had that kind of kicking\npower when we were so young, but I was even more\nshocked that you'd kick it at someone's house.
Heh... Well...
Since the day I moved to Nankatsu and saw\nthis amazing goalkeeper out on the field,\nI wanted to take you on, Wakabayashi.
I was thrilled when you accepted my challenge.
Well, there was no way\nI could back down from that.
But having a complete stranger best all of the\ndominant Shutetsu players... and then score on\nme... that left me shaken for a moment or two.
That was around the time I met Roberto...
Yeah, that's right! I thought he was some\nhomeless guy at first, but he really turned\nout to be a great guy in the end!
We've gotten way better since Roberto started\ncoaching us. Competition between Nankatsu and\nShutetsu certainly got fiercer.
Wasn't that also the match where I met Misaki?\nI miss having all my old soccer buddies around.\nThose were good times.
You competed against Wakabayashi,\nand the Nankatsu SC was born.\nThat led to our trips to Nationals.
We faced and defeated great players\nlike Hyuga to win that tournament.
I remember when you hit middle school, and soon\neveryone was like I'm going to beat Nankatsu,\nor I'm going to topple Tsubasa.
Back in elementary school, if you and Wakabayashi\nhadn't competed when you came to Nankatsu...
I may have never ended up representing Japan...
I'd go so far as to say that you and\nWakabayashi are the fathers of the current\nJapanese junior high soccer scene!
Can't say I don't like the sound of that...\nSo where do you come in?
I have to admit that my life changed\ndramatically when I met Ishizaki and Wakabayashi\nthat day.
Same.
I mean, that a player as bad as I was would now\nfind himself wearing a rep uniform and competing\ninternationally...
Heh... Thinking about it now...\nIt's such a strange feeling.
Yeah, it is kind of strange\nhaving you on the team.
Wh-What?!
Heh heh...
But, umm... I get what you're trying to say.
If I hadn't met the two of you back then,\nI wouldn't be who I am today.
I wish I'd been there, too.
It sounds like it was a historic moment.
Jealous? Unfortunately, that's\nhow life goes sometimes.
Yeah... and it's because I was there.
Ugh, big words for a klutz like you, Ishizaki.
But Ishizaki did work harder than anyone.\nIt's only natural he's here with us.
Thanks for noticing, Tsubasa!
But even though we've made a lot of great\nmemories playing together like we are now, we'll\nall being going our separate ways when it's over.
But when this tournament's over,\nwe'll all be split up again.
Wakabayashi to Germany... And Tsubasa to Brazil\nafter graduation... It's a bit sad, really.
Yeah.
But that's all the more reason\nto win this tournament.\nGoing out on top is how we ice this cake.
You bet.
Duh! Even I was thinking that!
Haha! But do you really, Ishizaki?
Ouch... That one stung.
Alright! What're we slacking off for then?!\nThere's still time to practice!
That's the spirit, Ishizaki!\nOkay then... Back to it!
Well, I get the feeling that,\nif I keep practicing with Tsubasa,\nall my limitations will evaporate!
Tsubasa inadvertently taught me about my own\nconfidence and pride, <avatar_name>.
Ever since he scored that goal on me, I've been\nso obsessed with showing him up that I've even\ntaken time off from school to practice.
If I hadn't met Tsubasa and Ishizaki back\nthen and hadn't taken Tsubasa's challenge,\nI don't know where I'd be today.
Well... I suppose I don't\nneed to dwell on it too much.
Alright! C'mon and practice with us! We've\nall gotta do our part if we're gonna win this!
I brought sports drinks everyone!
Ah, there you are!
Thanks! These are great for beating this heat.
You're timing could've been better, though.
Huh?
Coach Shiroyama brought some\nright after you guys went.
He did?!
Yeah, you just missed him.
Who's Coach Shiroyama?
If I recall correctly...
He's the coach of Nankatsu SC.
In other words, he was the coach that\ntook Nitta and us all the way to the top!
Yeah, he's the Nankatsu SC coach.
Specifically, he's who helped\nguide us and Nitta to victory.
Come to think of it, Nankatsu SC was a really\nstrong team. We were the national champs two\nyears running.
Staying the champs after restructuring\nthe entire roster is a heckuva feat, too.
We had Tsubasa, Misaki, and Wakabayashi\non the team, so it was pretty stacked.\nBut Coach Shiroyama knew best how to use us.
He always got us pumped up, and helped us\npersevere when we lost to Meiwa FC in the\npreliminaries.
He always knew how to rev the engine.
He never nitpicked, either. He let us figure\nourselves out and play the game the way we wanted.
That's well put.
There was only one time he was hard on us;\nwhen we were losing to Shimada Elementary.
He said, "If we can't overcome an ordeal like this\none, we can't possibly keep up in the Nationals\nwhere the competition will be at its peak."
He really knew how to push us.
Wow. This is the first I've\nheard about this side of him.
The way we approach soccer on our own terms...\nIt's all thanks to Coach Shiroyama.
The way we played was to analyze the situation,\nand then battle it out with faith in ourselves\nand our teammates.
By the way, Nitta, he mentioned\nyou when we were talking.
He saw the showdown between you and Tsubasa\nin the finals of the Shizuoka Regionals.
Oh?
Though Tsubasa won out, he was impressed with\nhow you pulled off the Falcon Running Volley.
Ha! Well, I'm happy to hear that.
And I won't lose to Nankatsu or Tsubasa again!
Now, that's the spirit!
I hate losing...\nBut now we have a chance to redeem ourselves.
Let's beat Nankatsu and give\nCoach Shiroyama the good news after!
Tak!
Hey, you over there!
You out here by yourself?\nLooks like Japan's done practicing already.
Guess you'll have to do then. I was curious about\nyou guys since you're the other Asian team here.\nSo why don'cha show me what you got?
Who are you again?
Heh. I hope you're\nready for a beatdown.
Ah, right, sorry my bad. The name's Bunnaak.\nI'm Captain of the Thai Junior Youth team.
Heh, sure, act tough while you still can. Lookin'\nforward to crushing that confidence out of you.
Oh, right, before I forget. Name's Bunnaak,\nCaptain of the Thai Junior Youth team.\nDon't worry, you'll remember me.
My team's not takin' part in the tournament,\nbut they invited us here to be the opponents\nfor some exhibition matches.
So anyway, after seein' you play in that last\nmatch, I just had to come see what you've got\nfor myself.
Alright, let's get this started!\nRelax, I won't hurt ya. Well, not much, anyway.
Hyah! Take this!
Whoops, did I overdo it?\nHa, the Japanese are such wimps.
Still standin', huh? You've got guts, I'll give\nyou that. Well, as a fellow Asian it'd be pretty\npathetic if you couldn't handle at least that.
It's getting dark though.\nGuess it's time to call it a day.
This wasn't a bad way to kill some time.\nLater, <avatar_name>.
Hoo! Ha! Byah!
Rargh!
*pant*
What, it's just you, <avatar_name>?
So, what's up? Here for round two?
You are a soccer player...\nright?
Um... actually I'm here\nto play soccer?
Oh, you mean what I was workin' on just now?
Now, I'm just a soccer player, but until recently\nI used to do Muay Thai competitively, too.\nYou HAVE heard of Muay Thai, right?
It's a traditional Thai martial art.\nI wouldn't be in such great shape without it.
Ah, right, my bad. Soccer practice is over for\ntoday, so I'm still training my Muay Thai in my\nfree time.
You HAVE heard of Muay Thai, right?\nIt's a traditional Thai martial art.\nI used to do Muay Thai competitively, too.
Hey, since you're here, how about you try it out?\nThere's nothin' better for whipping your body\ninto shape.
Relax, we'll start with the basics.
Okay, listen up.
Put your back into it! One more time!
Okay, now you're gettin' it!\nRemember how that felt and do it again!
Alright! That was nice kick!
Anyway, not bad for your first time.\nYou've got a knack for this.
You wanna know how this helps?\nYou gotta figure that out for yourself.
But in my case...
Oh, I know, I'll just show ya.
Just try to slip past me, one on one!
And there ya go.\nSee how a body forged by Muay Thai helps yet?
Anyway, you better go get some rest after trying\nthe new conditioning. I don't want it to be my\nfault if ya can't get outta bed tomorrow.
Drop by again if ya ever got time!\nI'll take you on again or whatever!
Graaah!
Oh hey, it's you.
Hmph. Since you passed me the ball,\nI'm guessin' you're here for a showdown?
Fine. But I'm warnin' you, I'm in a bad mood,\nso don't blame me if ya get hurt!
Ready or not, here I come!
Wh-What? YOU got ME?!
Can't believe you used my own move against me...\nYou've been practicin', huh?
Sorry 'bout all that...\nToday's just been ticking me off.
We ain't part of the tournament, but comin' here\nand playing these international teams... watchin'\ntheir games live... Makes me feel so small.
And on top of that, you knockin' me around\nlike that... That hits hard. Kwai!
Like, even just in Asia there are guys like you\naround... Forget takin' on the world, I don't\neven KNOW anything 'bout the world yet.
Heh. I was undefeated in Muay Thai.\nBut soccer... that's the real challenge.
So why did you start\nsoccer then?
Why not commit to Muay Thai?
It's like... in Muay Thai everything that mattered\nwas inside those ring ropes.\nBut with soccer the field's so much larger.
Long story short, I like to go big.
The Muay Thai ring was too small for me.
The soccer field is immeasurably bigger than my\nold square ring, and I like big things better than\nsmall things.
I like to dream big, too. As champion of Muay\nThai, what's left for me there?\nIt's time for something new.
Soccer's different. The whole world's playing\nsoccer. In a sport like soccer, bein' the world's\nbest means so much more!
And someday, you're gonna be standing in my way...\nShould I crush you now?
Ha ha, I'm just messin'! If we're gonna\nhave our showdown, it's gonna on the pitch!
But I'm dead serious about that part. If we ever\nface each other on the field, I will destroy you.
To me, both soccer and Muay Thai are serious\nmartial arts. And I'll teach you that the hard\nway if necessary.
But seeing how you still have matches left in\nthe tournament, you're off the hook. For now.
But man, I can't believe Japan made it to the\nfinals... That's crazy. I've never been more\nproud of our corner of the world.
Make sure you win this, got it?\nThat'll make it all the sweeter when I defeat you.
Looks like Japan's making its way up the\ntournament ladder, and you're not doing\nhalf-bad yourself.
So, as a fellow Asian, I'll be rootin' for you\nguys. You better make it all the way to finals.\nYou better WIN the finals!
Man, we've been talkin' so long I already feel\nrefreshed. Wanna kick the ball around some more?
Ha! Ha!
Bam!
Not too shabby.
Oh hey, <avatar_name>.\nNeed something? I'm in the middle of training.
Can I train, too?
Is there anything\nI can help with?
What? You wanna do Muay Thai, too?
Hmm... I'm gonna be straight with ya,\nsparring with you would be a waste of my time.
Oh, I know!
You don't mind? Well, I won't say no.\nI was gonna finish off with some muscle training.
Normally I'd get a partner to hit me and stuff,\nbut I don't have one today.
I want you to kick that ball as hard as you can\nright at my abs.
That'll toughen me up, and you can get some\npractice controlling your shots. Everybody wins.
Okay, bring it on!
Hmph, you expect me to get anything out of\na limp-noodle shot like that?!\nOne more time with feeling!
Harder! That was pathetic!\nIs that all you've got?!
Now, before I lose all respect for you, why don't\nyou kick that ball like you're trying to hurt me!
Gah! Ugh...
That was the move I used on you before!
Dang, that was awesome!\nYou actually managed to hurt my abs of steel!
And more than that, you have\nthe eyes of a warrior! I love it!\nSoccer really is another martial art!
As long as you have the strength to crush your\nenemies, you'll always come out on top, whether\nin the ring or on the field!
Thanks, buddy!\nYou made today's training all worth it.
A kick like that last one'll take you places.\nSo you better show me it in action in your next\nmatch!
C'mon, what's the matter?! Put your back into it!\nYou call that a kick? You're hitting a heavy bag,\nso no need to hold back!
That was pathetic... You'd never beat even a\njunior division Muay Thai fighter with a limp\nkick like that!
Okay, I'll show you how it's done.\nYou steady the bag!
Gah! Grawr!
See? Bet you could feel that impact even through\nthe bag. Now, THAT'S a kick.
We need you to remember that feeling deep\nin your bones, so I'm gonna keep 'em coming!\nBetter brace yourself!
I can't believe you managed to take\nall those kicks one after another.\nPhew, that was exhausting just to watch.
So, do you think the training helped any?
Hey, Ishizaki! <avatar_name>!\nStop spacing out in practice!
C'mon, just a little can't hurt.\nWhy do you have to be so stubborn?
Feeling clever today?\nGuess it's time to whip you back into shape!
H-Hey, hold on Hyuga!
Eat this!
Uwah! Get out of the way, <avatar_name>!
What?!
A-Are you okay?
This is...\nthe value of training!
I've grown tougher.
O-Oh, really? So even a Tiger Shot doesn't\nscare you? Ha ha ha, you've beefed up, huh?
Well, it's hard to disagree after seeing it\nfirsthand...
The way you stopped that ball was incredible,\n<avatar_name>.
But you gotta stay focused in practice. Got it?
Heh, I bet it hurts seeing your beloved Tiger Shot\nso easily turned aside.
Hmph, I'd never go all out against my teammates.\nI went just hard enough to knock some sense\ninto you.
(Still, he shouldn't have been able to take my\nTiger Shot that easily...)
(Looks like <avatar_name> has built some abs\nif he can take shots like that!)
Was wonderin' what ya were so excited ta see.\nSo it's the Thai reps, huh?
Huh... Isn't the Thai team only here for\nexhibition matches? But you think there's a\nplayer we should watch out for on their team?
There's someone you'd like,\nJito.
Someone like Sano would\nget blown away.
Anybody I should see? Who d'ya reckon?
Wait, number 4? Gotta say he looks he can rumble.
Oh, I see, a martial artist.\nNow, that's a fight worth havin'.
This again...?\nCould you at least keep it on the field please?
Say what? Ha ha, yeah right.\nI wouldn't be sent packing so--
Łoł! That number 4 guys is as big as Jito.
Huh? He's a former martial artist?
Ha ha, okay Jito, I'll let you have first dibs\non him.
That's a foe worth grindin' ta dust.
Looks like defense is gettin' ready to work.
Now, let's see if that guy's got moves.
(Huh. Looks like he brought his friends this time.\nThe audience is growing.)
(Heh. Maybe I should give 'em\na little scare then.)
Okay guys, for today's Defender training we're\ngonna go hard, like it's the real thing!\nLet's teach 'em to fear the might of Thailand!
Ha!
Alright! Come at me whenever!
Wham!
Ooh...
Hmph! I'll finish you off myself!
Nice! Good work guys!
Wh-What the...? Ever since they ate that tackle,\nthe team's been scared to encroach.
Ga ha ha! Now, I get it! That's their game!
Wha...?
Those Thai guys must be thinkin' that no one would\nwanna mess with 'em after seein' a brutal tackle\nlike that.
Fight or a match, once you got 'em scared,\nthey won't step to you no more.\nYou've got 'em permanently on their back foot.
That sounds strangely convincing,\ncoming from you Jito.
And if that number 4 guy used to be a martial\nartist, then I bet he knows something about\nmakin' it hurt.
Heh, your average tough guy wouldn't stand\na chance.
Sano, <avatar_name>, that Thai guy just showed\nus a playbook that'll be easy enough to copy.
Next year, you two'll be leading the team.
So, it couldn't hurt to keep in mind how to\nuse your strength in a match, like that guy!
(Hmm... He gets kinda hard to follow when\nhe's excited like that...)
Absolutely! Isn't that right, <avatar_name>?
Ga ha ha! Can't wait to see how you guys'll do\nnext year!
Still, I'd love a chance to throw down with that\nguy, too.
Um, please don't be too violent!
(Heh. It's <avatar_name> we're talking about,\nso I bet he's already thinkin' about how to use\nthis strategy himself.)
(Besides, that big guy next to him looks like\nhe's already figured it out.)
(Well, whatever. We'll perfect this offensive\nstyle our own way, and put the fear of Muay Thai\nin 'em!)
Alright guys, one more time! And show some heart!
Bam!
Ha! You thought you stood a chance with THAT?!
Okay, okay, let's take a breather.
Hm? You got somethin' to say?
Isn't this just violence?!
Do you really have\nto hit so hard?
Ha! That's the most pathetic thing I've heard all\nday! Soccer and Muay Thai are both martial arts.\nThe ring and the field are the same thing, got it?
If the ref doesn't blow their whistle, it's not\na foul. You've taken enough hard tackles to\nknow what I mean, right?
What kinda stupid question is that? Soccer is a\nmartial art. We can hit 'em as hard as we like,\nas long as it's not a foul.
Besides, you've taken enough hard tackles.\nYou've figured out why they work, right?
Okay... I'm guessin' from that slack-jawed look on\nyour face that you don't. Man, you can be slow on\nthe uptake.
Fine, then let me ask you this. Do ya think you\ncan hop back up and start playing again like you\nalways do?
No, you can't. Because my tackles hurt.\nThey hurt your body and your mind.\nAnd that pain echoes for a while.
The purpose of this should be clear.
When people take a big enough hit, it slows them\ndown. And in their minds, they remember that pain,\ntoo, and they're less eager to engage.
And by then it's game over. All that's left is to\ncrush 'em in one go, while they're still too\nscared to fight back.
In Muay Thai that's what we call a knockout!
In Thai, we say "kill two birds with one shot."\nI think you guys throw stones, right?
Point is, you get two things done with one action.\nSounds good, right?
I mean, it's up to you if ya wanna take that\napproach, but at least you get my strategy now.
Whoops, looks like we were talkin' longer than I\nthought. You've got your strength back by now,\nright?
Good. Let's get back to it then.
Okay, now that I've had my fun try and\nhit me back! Beat me at my own game!
(I'm glad I came to watch the tournament.\nWhat a collection of talent from our generation.)
(Every last one of these countries is raising\nplayers with their own unique talents.)
Aren't you... one of the Japanese players?
Are you here to gather intel on some opponents,\ntoo?
This is just a hobby of sorts.
You?
I see. For me it's both a hobby and for practical\nreasons, but I see you love soccer, too.
Oh, excuse me, I should introduce myself.\nI'm Stefan Levin.
I'm from Sweden, but we're not participating in\nthe tournament. I came here as part of a group\nobserving the proceedings.
Please, excuse me. I'm Stefan Levin, captain of\nthe Swedish team.
That said, Sweden isn't participating in the\ntournament, so I'm just came here as part of\na group observing things.
I'm really glad I came. I never imagined I'd\nget to see so many interesting players.
Of course, I've done my research on Japan. I'm\nespecially interested in your goalie who played\nin Germany, as well as your number 10.
As for you...
Oh, excuse me.
Hello? Yes... Understood.
Sorry, that was from the leader of the group.\nLooks like I'll need to head back.
Let's chat again sometime, if there's a chance.\nHopefully, with more time to spare.
--It's even pretty at night, isn't it?
I told you, it's not a vacation, so stop\npouting... I wish I could've seen it with you,\ntoo.
Ha ha, don't worry about that. We don't even have\nany matches, so there's not much point in praying\nfor me.
Yes, of course. I bought some souvenirs,\nand I think you'll love them.
Okay, got it. You take care.\nDon't do anything reckless while I'm away.
Yup, I will. Love you too, bye.
Huh? <avatar_name>?
Were you listening?
I-I didn't mean to!
Who was that?\nYour girlfriend?!
No, no, I'm not angry or anything.\nIt's just embarrassing.
I was talking to my girlfriend just now.\nWe've known each other since way back.
Y-Yeah.
We've known each other since way back. Apparently,\nshe's been praying for me to make it back safely.
I'm not sure what she's worried about though.\nIt's perfectly safe here.
I see you've got a soccer ball...\nUp for some practice?
...
I see. Then could you come with me?
This is a practice area anyone can use.\nThey even lend out balls and jerseys.\nReally, they have everything you could want here.
Now, let's get started, shall we?
I've always thought practicing with a partner was\nmore effective than by yourself, and I have to\nadmit I'm curious about you after seeing you play.
Don't worry about revealing your secrets;\nI won't be playing you in the tournament so what\ngood would they be to me?
Huh? You're more worried about whether\nI'm tough enough to keep up?
Good point, I guess you've never seen me play\nbefore. Oh well.
Pass me the ball for a sec.
Check this out!
So? Still worried?
To be honest, after so many days of just watching,\nI've been getting the itch to play.
Now, I won't be holding back at all, so I'm\ncounting on you to take this seriously too, okay?
Alright, let's get started!
Yeah... I love watching too, but nothing\nbeats actually kicking a ball around.
Still, you really seemed to be having fun back\nthere. You've got a good feel for the ball.
I could say\nthe same about you.
You seem to be having\na lot of fun yourself.
Of course, it's your most important friend.
Right, we're the same.
So... Why is it I feel so jealous of you?
No, never mind... Forget I said that.
Now, that's enough chatting.\nWe've got some time, so let's keep playing!
Here I come, <avatar_name>!
I've got you now!
Wh-What? You got past me that easily?!
Nice feint... I can't let myself fall behind.
Oh? That's my move...\nYou managed to pick it up so quickly...
That's quite the talent you've got.
Hey there, <avatar_name>.\nDo you have time to talk?
I got to see Japan in practice today,\nand I think I see the secret to your success.
Every position has players to watch out for,\nand plenty of them require special attention.
Like I said before, I was especially interested\nin Wakabayashi, the best goalie in Germany, and\nTsubasa, the three-time Japanese national champ.
And now I'm interested in you too, <avatar_name>.
From what I've seen, you might just be the player\nwho's improved the most over the tournament.
Coming here really has been eye-opening...\nEvery last country has star players I'd never\nheard of before.
I've wanted to be the best soccer player in the\nworld ever since I was a kid, but I suppose that\nwon't be so simple.
*sigh* Why wasn't Sweden invited to play\nin the tournament?
There are all these incredible teams here that I'd\nlove play against. Of course, that includes you.
Looking forward\nto playing you, too.
Can't wait to show you\nhow it's done.
I'm honored to hear you say that. And after seeing\nhow high level the play is here, I don't expect\nI'll lack for motivation to keep improving myself.
When we do play each other in a real match,\nI'll be ready.
How confident of you. But it won't be that easy.
Coming here has been just the motivation I needed\nto take it to the next level. Next time we meet,\nI'll be a whole new player.
Sorry to take up your time. It just wouldn't feel\nright saying this over the phone or something.
Now, keep up that momentum and advance through the\nfinals. I can't wait to see you in action again.
So, Japan's next opponent is France? France is\nanother team that's improved a lot for this\ntournament, so be careful.
I can't wait to watch you make it to the finals.
Your next match is the finals with Germany. I wish\nI could say I'd be rooting for you, but to be\nhonest Germany has a special place in my heart.
Speaking as a soccer fan, I just honestly can't\nwait to see both of you clash.
So, it's finally time for the finals, huh?\nConsidering how you've done so far, I think we\ncan safely say it'll be a match for the ages.
And thanks for listening. Get some rest.\nYou need to be at your best for that match.
With any luck, I'm sure we'll meet again. Goodbye.
Huh, that team has such amazing coordination.\nWhat a shame, I wish I could've played them...
Hey there, <avatar_name>. You here to watch? There\ncertainly is a lot you can learn by watching.
By seeing other people play in person,\nyou can imagine how you'd play against them.\nIt's almost like playing yourself.
Like, take that player who's good at feints.\nHow would you deal with that?
I'd watch him closely,\nthen strike at an opening.
I'd just power through.
I agree, that's a good way to approach it. Move\nrashly and you'll be playing right into his hands.
But of course, you don't have the luxury to take\nyour time and observe him either. If you slow\ndown to do that, he'll slip right past you.
True. If you're confident you can overpower him,\nthere's always that option.
But when you're faced with skilled feints like\nthat, being able to properly apply that power is\nitself the challenge.
As for me, let's see... Remember the Aurora Feint?\nYou learned it, too. Did you know it can be used\non defense?
As for me, let's see...\nDo you remember my special dribble, the Aurora Feint?\nMaybe I could use it to turn the tables on him.
Basically, every feint has its own escape route.\nStifle that and you're golden.\nEliminate their options.
On top of that, if you can find an opening created\nby their feint, that's another chance to steal the\nball. You'll upset their rhythm.
Stopping a feint with a feint... I wonder if\nyou can find a way to put that to good use.
Whoops, sorry. Excuse me.
Hey, what's up?
(The way he moves in practice is completely\ndifferent from how he moves in matches.\nHe must be more unstable in his matches.)
Oh, <avatar_name>? When did you get here?
Just wondering what\nyou're up to.
Well, you're grinning\nat your phone, so...
What, this?
I was comparing a video of the team in a match\nwith their practice just now.
Really? That's how I looked...?
Whenever I think about soccer,\nI just can't help but smile.
Look, I was comparing a video of the team\nin a match with their practice just now.
That's what the observation group is here for:\nto gather info and do research like this.
I think it's a great chance to improve\nmy own skills, too.
Of course, I've done my research on the Japanese\nteam, both in practice and matches.\nThat includes you, obviously.
Speaking of which, I noticed something when I was\nwatching the video. You have this strange habit\nwhen taking a shot. Where'd you pick that up?
But from what I can tell from the way you move,\nyou should be able to get more speed and control\nof your shots.
Mind if I gave you a little advice?
What? Not used to getting help from someone\noutside your team?
Well, whatever. Idziemy!
Okay, let's get started!
Hmm, I think you're stepping in too deep with your\npivot leg. If you do that, the kick will end up\nbeing too deep and the ball will lose speed.
This time the kick position is too far forward.\nYou might get speed out of it, but it's not gonna\ngo where you want it to.
There. Now, you've got it!
You have to kick the ball hard toward a difficult\nplace for the goalie to reach. It's basics,\nbut also the most important part of shooting.
Now, just make sure your muscles remember\nthat feeling. And don't stop working on it!
(I also got Sweden's scientific training drilled\ninto me. We have our own high-level logic.)
(I didn't even realize how ingrained it is in me.)
(I was able to properly teach it to <avatar_name>,\nand it seems he picked it up just fine.)
Hey <avatar_name>, sorry for calling you up out of\nthe blue.
As you know, Sweden's not participating in this\ntournament.
That's why lately I've been getting a bit jealous\nwhen I see you doing your thing out there.
Maybe this is what people call envy.
But you know, the more matches I see, the more I\ncan't help but want to know how well my skills\nwould hold up in this tournament.
Which leads me to a favor I'd like to ask of you.
I have a new theory for a shot I haven't been able\nto test out in an actual game.
I want you to learn this shot and give it a trial\nrun in the tournament for me.
What? I thought you'd wanna have a match.
You sure? We might be on opposite sides one day.
Oh yeah, that did cross my mind.
But I'd rather see how well this shot does on\na global stage. I've distilled some of my best\ntechnique into it.
That's true.\nBut haven't you ever thought of it like this?
If you're aiming to be the best in the world, the\ntaller that mountain is, the more rewarding it is\nto summit.
If you learn the technique and then go on to\nbecome truly challenging competition,\nwhat more could I want?
In any case, we both have something to gain from\nthis.
So, what do you say? Will you do it?
Thank you. Well, let's get started.
We have to get this ready while the tournament's\nstill going. Clock's a-ticking.
Phew... Pretty much that, basically.
In theory, the most important aspects are speed\nand control, not unlike the shot I taught you\nbefore.
But then I took those two things, worked on them\nmeticulously, and this shot was the result.
Of course, it'll take some work,\nbut I'm sure you can master it.
Okay. Let me show you how it actually works.\nFirst—
Uh-uh. If you're gonna shoot like that,\nyou're better off using a regular shot.
Try to keep different kinds of spin in mind.
Alright... Your movement's looking better.
But the impact at the end is still a little weak.\nYou're not taking advantage of the spin with that.
Maybe it's the angle in the last kick...
...?!
That's it! The speed and control of that shot just\nnow were amazing. That's exactly how it looks when\nI do it!
Now, that you've got this shot in your tool belt,\nit's time for you to use it out there.\nI'm counting on you.
Once you've rocked the tournament... I mean, when\nyou land Japan the championship, I hope I get to\nplay you guys.
We'd win, of course. But you'd be a perfect\nchallenge for me on the road to being the\nworld's best soccer player.
(Your soccer sense knows no bounds... You're a\ntough opponent if there ever was one. That's why\nI'm looking forward to the day we square off.)
Oh, yeah. You must be beat from all the\npracticing, huh? Let me teach you a self-care\ntechnique I just learned.
I want you to be in tip top condition for the next\nmatch.
(You must really love soccer, practicing until\nyou've worked yourself to the bone like that.)
(For real...\nYou're something else, <avatar_name>.)
Hey, <avatar_name>. Eager as ever, I see. But if\nyou're here at this hour that must mean you're off\ntoday?
Me, too. It's kind of a hobby of mine to go around\nand watch the other teams.
This tournament's so fascinating. What with\ngetting to study a bunch of different teams\nwhile they practice.
It's been pretty surprising. Like how they have\nthose awesome practice grounds, even though this\nis simply for exhibition matches.
Not gonna lie, I wanted to participate in the\ntournament as a player. That said, I'm glad I\nget to watch.
This way, I take part in the matches from the\nstands, even if it's just in my head.\nThat'll have to hold me over this time.
By the way, <avatar_name>,\nwhat do you think of this team's approach?
I haven't the slightest.
What do YOU think, Levin?
Right. No, that's fine.
However, if you plan to keep playing soccer in\nthe future, you should familiarize yourself with\ntactics more.
Hey, now, are you turning the question on me?
If you plan to keep playing soccer, you might\nwant to start doing some research on team tactics.
But hey, you asked so I'll answer.
As I see it, this team's captain has excellent\noffensive and defensive capabilities.
However, it's impossible for him to both defend\nwhile putting together and executing an attack.
If it was me... Yeah, I think I'd use a strategy\nthat would make that captain a shooter.
Pulling together an offense or a defense depends\non the team's overall skill, but often the actual\nshot comes down to an individual's skill.
Still, I think a team's power can draw out\nan individual's strengths even more.
For example, a team gets their hustle on at\njust the right moment to attack as a group.
In that moment, the captain's trust in his team\ngives him the confidence to position himself where\nhe knows he can make the shot.
In fact, I'm the core of just such a strategy.\nI've been putting to work at the club team where\nI'm captain.
I mean, I'm a midfielder, but I figure I could say\nthe same thing about this team.
You were chosen to be a national representative at\na young age. It probably won't be long before you\nfind yourself leading a team of your own.
You should fill your head with team strategies\nlike these in preparation. Always best to give\nyourself a wide array of options.
I guess this is pretty obvious, but don't forget\nto keep polishing your skills. You'll need to keep\n'em sharp, so you can put plans into action.
What's that? You wanna hear more about the\nstrategy from earlier?
Sure, I don't mind.\nGetting a taste for strats now?
Okay. Well, let's cover some details.
Oh, before that... If you don't mind,\nwanna go see the next team's practice?
Let's keep talking soccer with you!
There's so much you can learn just from getting\nto watch practices from the stands like this.\nI'm really grateful for the opportunity.
But then you watch a match and it really\ndrives home that practice is just practice.
Come game time, everyone's doing their best to\nwin. They're using their best moves at full power\nevery time. Compared to that...
Also, no matter how much research you do from the\nstands, the better the player, the more of a gap\nthere is between what you can and can't see.
I wanna play a match so bad. There's no better way\nto research than to see an opponent down on the\nfield.
I was actually thinking that I hope I get the\nchance to see your level of play in person\nsomeday.
Us on the Swedish team have been watching various\ncountries' teams every day, but there's something\nunusual about your plays.
They're all so characteristic.\nYou can just see a figure emerge from them.
I've seen a lot of players,\nbut I've yet to find another quite like you.
My plays are mine alone.
I'm just doing the best\nI can out there.
To be sure, that's likely your unique style,\nof course.
You can't fool these eyes, though. I bet you've\nborrowed several different players' techniques.
Is that right? Maybe you're just not aware\nyou do it.
It couldn't have been easy learning different\nplayers' techniques, and turning them all into\none flavor, so to speak.
I've actually also tried to do the same and learn\nother players' techniques.\nIt's definitely something I focus on.
Like I was saying, matches are opportunities for\nresearch and analysis, especially in one-on-ones.\nYour opponent's skills really come through.
In those times, even if you only catch one aspect\nof a move, you can concentrate on how you can\napply it yourself.
I'm always trying to observe my opponents keenly\nwhile playing.
You'd not thought about it that way?
I figured you'd have developed more of a hunger\nfor your opponents' techniques already.
If you find it suits you,\ntry to keep in mind what I said earlier.
I'm curious to see how your game might change\nif you also got into such a habit.
I'm sure you'd become an even more impressive\nplayer.
And the stronger you become as a player,\nthe more I have to look forward to.
Let's definitely have a match someday. We'd win,\nthough, of course. Make sure you're ready.
Oh, looks like it's time to go watch the next\ncountry. I gotta go meet up with the observation\ngroup.
Catch you later.
Huh? Where's <avatar_name>?
Oh, yeah. I had the toughest time choosing\na souvenir at that stand.
Yeah, that's right. So, go on ahead.
Yeah.
Hey, <avatar_name>! We're heading back now, okay?
Ouch! Watch out!
Hey, that uniform...\nAre you one of the Japanese reps?
Who are you?
Are you with Mexico?
Me? I'm Ricardo Espadas,\nrep for the Mexican Junior Youth team.
Yep, I'm one of the Mexican Junior Youth reps.\nName's Ricardo Espadas.
I saw you in a match earlier.\nYou're... don't tell me... <avatar_name>, right?
Ha! Getting to a global tournament just to be out\nthere shopping and sightseeing.\nYou rich Japanese kids are totally different!
You better start getting ready.\nBetter believe we're comin' for ya!
Playing soccer with so little commitment... Lame!
I can't believe your weaksauce is moving ahead,\nwhile the Mexican team, we... Gah!\nI can't stand it!
Hey, we're serious\nabout soccer, too!
It's not like we're\nparticularly well-off.
Say whatever you want. We're literally playing\nfor our lives. Not that you can even begin to\nunderstand.
You mad? Then, prove me wrong.
Come to the Mexican training grounds later.\nI'll test your mettle myself.
Not well-off, he says. What you think of as\nwell-off... You haven't a clue.
Are you trying to tell me you know what it's\nlike to struggle to get by every single day?
You just come on down to the Mexican training\ngrounds. I'll show you myself just how different\nour resolve is.
Don't chicken out either, ya got it?!
*pant* *pant*
You, huh? So, you didn't just run away\nwith your tail between your legs.
Like I said before, I'm gonna see\nwhat you're really worth.
First off, let's see if you can even keep up\nin a workout with me.
We can settle things after you prove you're even\nremotely capable of keeping up.
Okay, let's get started!
Judging by your expression, this ain't much for\nyou yet, eh? Well, good because we're barely\ngetting started!
Oh, come on! If this is enough to tire you out,\nyou aren't ready for me!
We're still goin'! Last is ten dashes!
*pant* *pant*
Hmph. Not bad.
A promise is a promise.\nNow, we settle this through soccer.
And don't go saying you're too tired. I did two\nsets of what we just did before you came.
Considering circumstances, I'm already at a\ndisadvantage. So, if you lose, I don't wanna\nhear any excuses.
Let's get this over with.\nI've got training to get back to.
What even was that flimsy shot?! Is that the\nextent of your resolve? Is that all the drive\nyou've got?
Hmph. Don't underestimate me!
Is that it for your shots?\nWell, what do you think about this?!
*sigh* ...No contest.
Your dribbling's pretty\ngreat for a goalie!
Didn't think I'd have a\ndribble-off with a goalie...
This is why I can't stand stereotypes.\nEspecially about keepers.
I've got the best dribbling and the best shots out\nof my whole team.
It's not about being just good as a goalie,\nbut good enough to get out there and do everything\nthe offense can do.
Oh, is that a problem? The fact is I just showed\nyou up. If this had been a match, you would be in\ntrouble.
I've got the best dribbling and the best shots out\nof my whole team.
What I do is protect our goal one minute and then\npush up field toward the other goal the next.
In order to win, I'm gonna put everything I have\ninto every play I make, no matter what it takes.
Do you get it now? The effort and desire I'm\nbringing to the table is totally different from\nyours.
Do you have any idea what life is like for me?\nJust making ends meet is a struggle.
The only way to somehow escape that environment\nis to rise up out of it through soccer.
If you do get it then go home already.\nI've got training to do.
I don't get a chance to use all this shiny\ntraining equipment outside of this tournament.\nDon't wanna waste the opportunity.
(That guy didn't just keep up with my training,\nhe was able to react like that to my dribbling\nand shots.)
(Tch...)
*pant* *pant*
Gah... I can't believe I'm already breathing\nthis heavily.
What is it, <avatar_name>?\nYou're interrupting my training. Go home.
You can't do every kind of\ntraining on your own.
I wanna practice with you,\nEspadas.
Yeah, you've got a point.
Say what?!
(What's with this guy?)
...
Tch... Fine, suit yourself.
*pant* One more set. Idziemy!
*pant* *pant* You...\nYou kept up with me perfectly this time.
Did you really get that much more stamina in this\nshort a time?
Not bad. I'll take you on again today.\nHere, ball's yours.
(This guy! He should be as tired as I am,\nbut his shots are way stronger than last time!)
Ugh!
Crud! I can't believe I just got scored on...
Next up... Just try and stop me!
No way... Just how much training did you do after\nour last bout?
I'm going all out\nto win, too.
Losing last time was\ncrazy frustrating.
So, what you're saying is you trained as hard as\nyou could so you could beat me.
So, you used your frustration to get your focus\nback?
(Does this mean when it comes to soccer,\nour roots are the same?!)
...
Sorry. I gotta give you—
No, your soccer. I gotta give your soccer props.
I'm going to be a one-of-a-kind goalie to get out\nof my poor city. That's what I decided,\nand what I've been putting all my effort into.
I think I said it before, but my dribbling and\nshots are the best on my team. I think about\nboth goals. That's the style I want.
To be able to pull that off, though, I need the\nstamina to repeatedly run up and down the pitch\nand handle counters.
Thing is, I don't have that stamina just yet.\nThat's why I was outrun by the opponent's forward\nand we lost a point.
My keeper skills were lacking, too.\nI couldn't stop their ace's winning shot!
Make no mistake, I'm one of the reasons Mexico\ndidn't make it past the preliminaries.\nI'm painfully aware of my part in that.
That's not to say I'm about to give up.\nMy skill is gonna keep me alive.
I'm gonna train like crazy. Luckily, this place\nis packed with all sorts of training equipment.\nI can do stuff here I can't back home.
I'll show you this approach perfected some day\nwhen we have a chance to play again.
And when the time comes, we're gonna crush Japan!\nJust you wait!
You should head out. I wanna keep training so long\nas I have time.
Peace.
Here comes a juicy one!
From way over there? Don't kid yourself!
Heh. Gotcha!
Crud. Let me make it!
Phew, that was a close one.
Th-That should've been unstoppable...
Way to be, Wakashimazu.\nYou have the best reactions.
A shot that's tough for the keeper to catch?
I mean, obviously. It's a shot that changes its\ncourse the moment you think you know exactly where\nit's going.
Let me expand on that a bit.\nIt changes its course right before it's caught.
With a shot like that, even I'm not too sure\nI could react in time.
And right now, I'm working on just such a shot.
See, I'm a goalie. Who better to know what kind of\nshot gives goalies a hard time?
You wanna know what kind of shot it is?
Why don't you try figuring it out by yourself?\nEven if you beg, you won't get a peep out of me.
<avatar_name>!\nBall's coming your way! Shoot to score!
This is it!
Good call, Wakashimazu.
What?!
Urgh, what kinda shot was that?!
He bounced the shot off his own leg to change\nits course?! Did he really mean to do that?!
Well, I'll be... He's tryin' to mimic\nour combination by himself.
I'm not about to stay down!
He... He actually pulled it off.
But to have come to the same conclusion I did...\nI better watch my back.
What's up <avatar_name>? Is this what you wanted\nto show me? The Mexican team's practice?
Come to think of it, I hadn't been paying much\nattention to them. Did one of their players\ncatch your eye or something?
Secure the front of the goal! I don't care if you\ngotta draw a foul! Don't be scared to tackle!
Whoa there!
Yes! There's a good tackle! Go for the counter!
Countering off of a strong defense. They're true\nto the basics, I'll give 'em that much.
Wh-What's up with that goalie?!
Okay! Now, everyone pick up the pace!
He... That's beyond bold.\nHe's out there playing the field.
Not to mention, his call outs\nand the team coordination!
I got it!
Tak! We're getting better every time.\nYou're moving really well out there, guys.
What an awesome goalie... Even his dribbling\nand shooting are at a decent level.
And I thought I was an aggressive goalie, since\nas I sometimes join the offense. Never knew there\nwere players like this out there.
Thanks, <avatar_name>. If you hadn't brought me\nhere, I probably never would've found out about\nthis goalkeeper.
Anyway, his flashy plays may be getting attention\nin Mexican soccer, but from a goalie's\nperspective, that was an excellent counter.
Stealing the ball without fear of tackles, the way\nthe whole team picked up speed for the attack,\nand then the finishing cross to an aerial shot.
The synchronization and timing of that counter\nhe called out is something worth noting for any\nplayer.
Especially for you, since we need you and Takeshi\nleading Toho Academy next year.
And what with landing rep as a first year,\nyou'll probably end up leading a team eventually.
If you can learn that counter and add it to your\nstrats, it'll give the team more options to play\nwith.
After watching that goalie,\nthere's something I wanna try, too.
Sorry, <avatar_name>. I'm gonna go on ahead.\nYou make sure to learn that counter.
(Is that <avatar_name>?\nBet he's trying to steal our tactics.)
(Hmph. Doesn't matter.\nWe're just gonna keep getting better anyway!)
Okay! Let's go over that counter one more time!
That you, <avatar_name>? Perfect timing.\nPractice with me.
Right. Pass to me and I'll shoot.
Alright, ready!
Hmm... I'm just not getting my shots right today.
Let's switch. I'll pass and you shoot.
Dobra, idziemy!
Oh yeah, this pass feels right!
Again. This time I'm gonna send a fast one!
Nice! That's how you do it!
Let's call it a day, then.\nThat made for some pretty decent practice.
Thanks for the lesson\non passing.
Those passes had real\nsoccer sense.
Heh. I thought you might catch on to that.
Flatter me all you want.\nIt won't get you anything.
But you noticed, huh?\nYou really aren't one to take lightly.
So, when I make a pass that's gonna become a shot,\nthere's two things I keep in mind.
First, I try to make sure to place it in the most\ncomfortable place for the intended receiver to\ntake the shot.
Second, I time it so that the goalie is thrown off\nhis groove.
Pretty often, whether a shot makes it in is\ndetermined when the pass is made.
I have confidence in my shots,\nbut also in my ability to assist.
As a goalie, I'm always behind my teammates\nwatching. I know what goalies hate having done to\nthem. And that's something I can put to use.
I do it all to win. I'll win and seek my fame!
If your drive for soccer is like mine, keep a\nsharp eye on your teammates and opponents.\nThen put it to work in your plays.
Tch. Why does talking to you about this sorta\nthing throw me off so bad?
Well, see ya!
*pant* *pant*
Oh, <avatar_name>. Are you running here, too?
I don't think you've got the leg strength to\nreally take advantage of this kind of training.
Yeah, you're right.\nI need more training.
Wh-What proof do you have?
Did not expect you to have such a noble side to\nyou.
Coming to the fight with that kind of mentality\npretty much proves my point.
Anyway, the way I see it, you still have A LOT of\nwork to do as a soccer player.
For example, let's see...
Oh yeah. I saw you practicing the other day.\nYour movements after tackling and stealing the\nball are too sluggish.
The moment right after you steal the ball is\nwhen you really need to press the attack.
If you ask me, losing that opportunity with sloppy\nmovements shows your heart's not in the fight as a\nsoccer player.
Here's the thing. The moment the ball is yours,\nyour opponent hasn't gotten into a defensive\nposition physically or mentally yet.
That's why you have to use that opening to make\na mad dash into the enemy's side and get them\nscrambling.
And once you do that, you just keep that energy\ngoing, dribble within shooting range, and take\nyour shot.
Thinking of ways to counter is always at the\nforefront of my mind, whether I'm manning the goal\nor running the field.
That's why I just can't stand it when I see\nsomeone letting chances to counter slip by.
There I go wasting my breath.
I'm gonna get back to my training. See ya.
Hey, Ishizaki! Think we could start practice\na little early today?
Why? You got a hot date?
Very funny. Actually, I've been asked to join\nin on a local Bon Festival and play the drums.
Makes sense. You got the arms for it.
Hmm... A festival...
...
Okay! We'll finish up practice early,\nso we can all go together!
Eh?!
But... What about soccer?
Alright!
I get what you're saying, <avatar_name>, when the\nteam's together it feels like soccer is the only\nthing in the world.
But we all need a break once in a while,\nand if we're resting anyway, might as well hit up\na festival while we're at it, right?
You know it! I love soccer and all, but sometimes\nyou need to get away from the field for a bit and\nhave some fun.
Yeah, taking some time off to relax should help\nus stay focused on both soccer and our tests,\nso why not?
Not a bad idea. And we can go support\nTakasugi while he rocks those drums!
I wish Tsubasa could've come too though...
Yeah, me too. Just bad timing I guess.
C'mon, it's not like there won't be any\nmore festivals later this year. He can\njoin us next time.
Good point.
You're coming too, right Tsubasa?
Hmm... I've got a lesson with my Portuguese tutor\nuntil late tonight.
Then why not invite your tutor, too?
They can still teach you at the festival,\ncan't they?
Yeah... That's an interesting idea. I might be\nable to learn some words I wouldn't hear in a\nnormal lesson, too.
I guess it can't hurt to ask!
Okay, if we're gonna end practice early today,\nwe'd better make our time count! I need\nyou guys more focused than ever!
Now come on, let's do this!
Tak!
Phew... Eh, a start, I guess.
Huh? That jersey... You one of the Japanese reps?
That shot was incredible!
Um... Are you Japanese?
Thanks, man. I'm pretty proud of that one.
Well, if you think so, it's probably 'cause\nmy grandpa and my parents are Japanese.
Oh, right, haven't introduced myself.
Name's Ryoma Hino.\nBorn and raised in Uruguay, third generation.
Huh, so your name's <avatar_name>?\nEasy enough to remember.
We've got players of the same age from all over\nthe world here, so I came from Uruguay to check\n'em out, but...
Just watching's no fun, is it?\nSo I've been using the free fields to practice.
Luckily the guys here let you borrow not only\nthe fields, but uniforms and balls, too.
You want to practice with me?
You could be a rep with that shot.
Together?
You know what, it must've been fate that we met\nlike this. Sure beats practicing on my own.
I'm glad you think so, but I just never got\nthe call, y'know?
I'm over it though. It's just whatever.\nMore importantly, let's celebrate our\ncrossed paths with some practice.
Oh... They're already closing the fields\nfor the night.
Give me your contact info and we can go\nwhenever you're free.\nNot like I have anything better to do.
Thanks. Okay, here's mine.
Later, dude! Text me whenever!
Oh, <avatar_name>! Che, bo!\nThanks for reaching out!
Shall we start? Let's go mano e mano.
You're kidding me, over already? One more time!
Persistence doesn't always pay off, you know!
Huh, guess you've got some grit, after all.\nBut how about this?!
Ooh. Still at it, huh?
Good! I can do this all day!
I gotta admit, not everyone can take a beating\nlike that and keep getting up. I can respect that.
Your skills on the other hand...
Just wait til I get serious.
I'm way better in a match.
Yeah, you and every other sore loser.\nWere you even paying attention?
Someone's cocky.
Well, I get that there's a difference between\npractice and a real match.
Whatever. Next we'll work on shooting.
I know, since we're doing this together,\nhow about I teach you my trick?
From what I can tell, your legs seem strong\nenough, so if you use them better you can get way,\nway more power out of 'em.
You saw how strong my shot was earlier, right?\nWell, get shooting already!
You call that an impact?\nThat kick wasn't smooth at all.
Guess you need a demo, huh? Fine, fine.
Just copy me! And make sure not to blink!
Yo, <avatar_name>.\nYour shots have gotten pretty crazy, huh?
I told ya to copy me, but hoo boy I wasn't\nexpecting it to go THAT well. You got a sharp eye!
That reminds me, I saw your, er, Japan's match\nthe other day. Your team's better than I thought.
To be honest, I was sure that Italy or the\nNetherlands would kick your butts. And then\nyou go and sweep the prelims taking first!
I know you swept the prelims and all,\nbut I was sure Argentina would kick your butts.
You even beat France, who beat Uruguay, which\nmeans you kinda sorta beat me! Not really though.
I mean, I can't deny that your team's the real\ndeal. But... I got mixed feelings about that.
Don't get me wrong, I think it's incredible\nhow much you've done, but man,\nJapan's got some quality in their jerseys.
Especially number 10 and number 9...
If Japan's got monsters like that,\nconsider my interests piqued.
Why not play for Japan in the future?
You could always move to Japan.
I mean, I guess it's not impossible.
I was born an' raised in Uruguay, but I'm still\ntechnically Japanese through family.\nIf I wanted to I could.
Move to Japan? Honestly, I couldn't have\ncared less about Japanese soccer up until now.
Japan... Huh. I guess studying abroad\nfor high school doesn't sound so bad.
Meeting you, and seeing Japan play, makes me\nrealize just how much of this world I don't know\na thing about.
If I went to Japan for high school, I'd be playing\nagainst all the Japanese reps, right?\nSounds like fun.
Especially number 9. I just wanna go\nhead-to-head with him, no holds barred,\nand see what happens.
Your next opponent is Argentina, right?\nWatch out, they're good.\nYou'll need to be in top form to take 'em on.
Your next opponent is France, right?\nThe guys who beat Uruguay?
Beat 'em for me, alright? I'm not on the team,\nbut revenge still tastes just as sweet.
Oh right, we're already at the finals, huh?
Germany's Schneider is an ace among aces,\nyou know? I hope you're ready.
Oh right, we're already at the finals, huh?
You'll be up against Brazil, so watch out for\nCarlos Bara. He's a real monster.
Oh right, we're already at the finals, huh?
You'll be up against America.\nTo be honest, I know nothing about those guys\nexcept that they beat Germany and Brazil.
So watch out, especially for that Ryan guy.\nHe's no ordinary player.
I'll be there too, in the stands.\nYou'll hear me cheerin'.
Anyway, good luck!
Yo, <avatar_name>.\nWere you practicing with someone?
It's good to see ya gettin' fired up and all,\nbut spare some time for me, too.
How'm I supposed to become the world's number one\nstriker without practice?
(The country of my parents, huh?)
(I know I wanna be playing on the international\nstage someday, but for Uruguay or Japan?)
(Wait, isn't that Victorino?)
Gah! It's still not enough!
(At our current level, Uruguay's got a long way\nto go before we can take on the world!)
(And I'm our only ace!\nI need to pull us together!)
...
Yo, <avatar_name>? Out for a run?
Makes sense, with those scrawny legs.\nRunning on a sandy beach would be perfect for you.
That'll really toughen up those thighs and calves.\nMaybe you'll even be able to make power plays like\nmine.
Even that brutal dribble?
So I can pay you back?
You call that brutal?\nThat just shows how soft you are.
There's no place for mercy on the field.\nYou've gotta do whatever it takes to get past\nthe other guy.
I mean, you should know,\nyou've been on the other end of it.
Actually, this is perfect.\nIt's about time someone knocked you around a bit.\nLet's head to the training grounds.
Payback? So you're still holding a grudge\nabout that time I knocked you around?
I mean, I don't mind hanging out with you the rest\nof the day. We'll see if you can get your revenge.
Just try to get past me with that dribble\nI showed you!
Bring it!
No no no! You've got the power,\nbut where's the fight?!
THIS is how you show you're gonna knock the other\nguy into next week!
I'm talking about the drive to win, got it?\nThat hunger for victory!
You've still got guts, at least.\nAlright, one more time!
Stop holding back! Come at me like you're out\nfor blood!
I thought I told you to bring it!
Gah?!
Jeez, you really did it!
Now you've got it, <avatar_name>. Keep doing that.
Power's worthless without the will to use it.\nRemember on the field, you're scared of nothing.
Well, you've still got a ways to go before you\ncatch up with me, but we can work on those legs.
Whoops, looks like my home team's game is about\nto start, so we gotta wrap this up.
One last thing though...
I've been treating this as practice. In a real\nmatch, I go all out. Be ready when the time comes.
Later!
Oi, <avatar_name>. What are the odds we'd meet in a\nplace like this? You come watch this team often?
Anyway, we can watch together.
Whoa, that goalie's good. These are just practice\nshots, but it's a total shutout.
I'm a forward, so when I see stuff like this,\nI always end up thinking about how I'd go about\nscoring.
So hey, how about you? How would you take a point\noff that guy?
A careful kick at the corner.
Toy with him by curving my shot.
Not a bad plan. But that guy's pretty good\nat lateral movement.
Without enough raw force behind it,\nit might get punched or caught pretty easily.
Oh? Are you good at that sorta thing then?\nWell, nothing wrong with a little flexing.
But if he happens to read your curve,\nthen it's going right in his hands.
Me? I'd hit him straight on with the nastiest shot\nI could muster.
You're thinking that'd be easy to block, aren't\nyou? Well, even if it's deflected that's fine,\ntoo.
Because the damage is done, and even the toughest\ngoalie has to slow down after they've eaten\na solid shot.
And the moment they slip up,\nthat's when you've got your goal.\nThat's what it means to be a striker.
Besides, if your teammates are good enough,\nthey can take advantage of that weakened goalie\nright away.
Man, just imagine two of me up there...\nToo bad no one else can do what I can.
Anyway, I think I'll get going now. Watching the\nsame team for too long gets boring real quick.
Peace.
Yo, <avatar_name>. You were holdin' back\nin your team's practice match.
You may be a regular for now, but keep that up\nand they'll switch you out in a flash.
And don't say "it's just practice."\nPractice makes permanent.
What did I do wrong?
My play was perfect. What's up?
Hey, no need to grovel.
Seeing how you're such an eager student, fine,\nI'll tell you.
Perfect my foot. I know you felt something was\nwrong, but, well, maybe you don't get what.
Fine, fine, we're buds so I'll tell you.
Basically, you stopped trying when your team\nwas winning.
You can bet your butt the other team'll be putting\nall they've got into making a comeback,\nbut there you'll be, standing slack jawed.
It was just practice today so the other guys\nweren't taking it too seriously either,\nbut that's not how it goes in a match.
So listen up! When you're winning is exactly the\ntime to pull out all the stops and crush the\nother team.
Always be aiming for that next point. You can't\nbe scared of failure. It'll just slow you down.
Nothing wrong with showing your best stuff when\nit's down to the wire, but a team needs guys who\ncan secure victory, too.
Maybe I'm being too harsh...\nSeeing you dog it just ticked me off.
Whatever, I've said my piece.\nTake it or leave it. It's up to you.
Later.
Phew, that was close. Not Hyuga level, sure,\nbut that was some shot.
Wouldn't wanna take THAT one in the face, anyway.
You do realize you can block with other parts\nof your body, right?
Yo. You're getting pretty into this, huh?
What's wrong? Feeling frustrated?
...
I get it. Someone stopped your shot?\nYeah, that always sucks.
For what it's worth, your shot seems pretty darned\ngood to me.
But... wanna take it to the next level?
Alright, time for some training! Come with me.
Of course!
I'm not in the mood.
Good attitude.
I'm sure you'll get something out of this.
But this training's not gonna be easy.\nYou ready for it?
Mood? Soccer doesn't care about your mood!
You don't even know your own strengths!\nThat's what I'm here to teach you!
Strap in and follow me!
Come on! You gotta keep up the whole time!\nWe've got another ten laps!
*pant* Okay, good.
This is what I do every day, <avatar_name>.
And since you can keep up, you got some mean\nmuscles on ya.
Which means you can kick a ball just as hard\nas I do.
So I'm gonna take this shot,\nand I want you to watch real careful like.
Vroom vroom!
What I did just there was my Dragon Shot tuned up\nfrom watching some of the best strikes worldwide.
I call it the Hi-Dragon Shot.
Since I wanna play internationally someday,\nI've gotta be a world-class striker,\nso I upgraded my shot.
Now, <avatar_name>. We've just proven that anything\nI can do, you can do, too.\nSo that's your shot, too.
From here on out, I'll be teaching you\nthe techniques I've picked up.\nAnd you're gonna learn them.
Thank you so much!
But why are you teaching me?
No problem.
I wouldn't even have tried to improve this shot\nif I hadn't met you and decided to take things\nmore seriously.
So think of it as me returning the favor.
Well, why do you think?
Whatever. Doesn't matter.\nYou wanna kick harder, don't you?
Then, let's get started already!
Alright! Come on, <avatar_name>!
Wh-What the...?!
Gah, how did your shot get so much stronger\nand faster?
That was almost as good as Hyuga's Neo Tiger Shot.
When in the world did he...?
Looks like you've got a new rival for the Japan's\ntop striker spot, Hyuga.
That was a nice shot, but I'm outdone so easy.\nIf he wants to take me on, he's welcome to.
Hey, Wakabayashi. I'm next.\nI'm not holding back on this one!
Just how I like it!
(You did it, <avatar_name>.)
(But that number 9... He's almost as good as me.)
(Japan gets more and more interesting.)
Hey! You over there!
You're from Matsuyama's team, right? Furano MS?\nI think they called you <avatar_name>?
I saw you play the other day!\nI can't believe you're still a first year!
Furano almost beat Nankatsu back at Nationals\nand you're on the starting lineup!
You're from Misugi's team, right? Musashi MS?\nI think they called you <avatar_name>?
I saw you play the other day!\nI can't believe you're still a first year!
Musashi is like, elite,\nand you're on their starting lineup!
You're from Hyuga's team, right? Toho Academy?\nI think they called you <avatar_name>?
I saw you play the other day! I can't believe\nyou're still a first year and got into that\nschool's starting lineup!
You're from that team that fought Nankatsu in the\nShizuoka Regional finals, right? Otomo MS?\nI think they called you <avatar_name>?
I played against Nankatsu too,\nbut we didn't stand a chance.
I think it's pretty cool that you're already on\nthe starting lineup of a team like that as a\nfirst year.
You're from Tsubasa Ozora's team, right?!\nNankatsu MS? I think they called you <avatar_name>?
I saw you play the other day! You're incredible! I\ncan't believe a first year made it to the starting\nlineup of the undefeated champs!
Um... Who are you?
Wow, so I'm famous now?
Whoops, that totally slipped my mind.\nI should probably introduce myself, huh?
I'm Shingo Aoi. I'm a second year from the\nNakahara MS Soccer Club in Gifu.
Don't worry if you haven't heard of us.\nWe didn't make it to Nationals and obviously we\nweren't invited to the league tournament either.
Come on, as a first year starter in a tournament\nlike this, of course you're famous.
I'm jealous...
Whoops, I totally forgot to introduce myself!
I'm Shingo Aoi. A member of the Nakahara MS Soccer\nClub in Gifu and one grade above you.
Well, we're kind of a weak team that never\neven made it to Nationals, so no surprise\nif you haven't heard of us.
To be honest, I wish I could play in a tournament\nwith all these strong teams, too.
I mean, isn't going up against powerhouses the\nbest way to judge your own skill and improve?
But since I can't, I'm watching the matches very\ncarefully. Something might rub off on me,\nat least.
So anyway, that's why I'm here.\nAnd when I happened to see you walking by,\nI just had to come say hi.
By the way, are you already done with practice?\nI was thinking maybe we could kick the ball\naround together. If you don't mind, of course.
Or is it too late in the day?
Does it have to be today?
Maybe if you came back another day.
Wait, does that mean you're okay with it\nif it's not today?
For real? You don't mind?
If so, then yes, I am absolutely 100% fine with\nthat! I was going to come back to watch more games\nanyway, so I'll see you then!
I'm interested in your skill too, of course, but\nalso really want to see how the top players train.
Here's my contact info.\nCall me, text me, whatever, I'll be there!
You promised, right? I'll be waiting!
Hoo! Ha! Hoo! Ha!
Hey, <avatar_name>! Thanks for inviting me!
I'm so happy you remembered our promise!
Today, I brought a uniform so I'm ready to go!
You're juggling genius!
Are you planning to be a stunt performer\nor something?
You bet I am! Actually, in elementary I even won\nthe national juggling championship!
I mean, they only sent me there after I failed to\nmake it to the finals tournament, but... I've won\nall sorts of other juggling contests, too!
I guess that's a dream too... I mean, I've won all\nsorts of juggling contests, and it's the thing\nI'm most proud of.
But I'd rather be a real soccer player, you know?
Right now, I'm just some nobody, but someday I\nwant to hear the whole country shouting my name.
Anyway, I love compliments, but I'm not here\nto do kick-ups. This is just a warmup.
You're allowed to tell me what your team did\nat practice today, right?
Great! Please do!
Oh, I see. I see. Does that really work?\nI've gotta write this down.
Okay, so what else did you do?
Ha ha, really? Every day? Wow.
I'm starting to see why we didn't make it\nto Nationals.
Personally, I've got a friend who knows a lot\nabout soccer, and we study other teams to come up\nwith our own ways to practice and stuff.
But the older kids in my club don't take the game\nseriously. Like, they don't care if they get\nbetter or not.
I'm the only one there who even thought\nwe should try to get into Nationals.
And after that... Honestly, I felt like quitting.
Whoops, sorry, didn't mean to go so dark!\nI'm here to practice against a top player,\nnot to tell my sob story!
Anyway, I'm in line to be captain of the team\nnext year.
So I have to find out how we can improve\nwhile I'm in the driver's seat!
Alright, we still have work to do!\nNo time to rest!
Teach me more! Teach me everything!\nI'll manage no matter how hard it is!
*pants* *pant*
You're incredible.\nYou guys do more than just train harder...\nEverything you do has a specific purpose.
So you do all this every day and still practice\non your own time, too?
I see how you made the starting lineup.
Alright! I already have a little faith in my speed\nand technique.
So I'll train like this and level myself up!
Thanks for everything, seriously!\nI learned so much today!
I'm a little embarrassed to get so much help from\nsomeone younger than me without giving anything in\nreturn...
Oh, I know!\nMaybe I could teach you something I'm good at?
What, you're saying you already know\nhow to juggle?
Come on, that's not what I meant!\nI meant something you can use in a match!
Here, just watch.
And there. What do you think?\nThat's my special move.
I'll teach you the trick as thanks for everything.\nSomeone like you ought to be able to master it in\nno time.
So, first of all...
Hmm... Try again?
Whoa, look at the time! It's gettin' late!
Thanks again, <avatar_name>!\nPracticing with you was incredible!
Catch you later!
A-Amazing! You got it down pat already!
I have to make sure you don't end up better\nat my trick than me!
Which is why we can't waste any time! Let's get\nstarted on that training routine you taught me!
*pant* Just as tough as I remember...\nI can still barely keep up.
Can... can we take a little break?
Watching other people play is great and all,\nbut nothing beats playing yourself.\nI'm so glad I didn't quit.
I... didn't tell you this last time, but what made\nme think about quitting was losing to Nankatsu at\nthis spring's Tokai Soccer Festival.
I know what you're thinking,\nand no, it wasn't because of how badly we lost.\nI knew they'd be better than us.
Actually, it got me even more pumped up\nto keep facing strong teams.
But like I told you before,\nthe other kids just didn't care.
We were down five points by halftime, but they\ndidn't even feel frustrated. They were happy just\nto get a chance to play Nankatsu.
I couldn't stand their attitude, so in the second\nhalf, I stole the ball on my own and tried to take\non Nankatsu solo.
And with that dribble move I taught you, I made it\npast Kisugi, Taki, Takasugi... even Ishizaki.
But at the very last moment, right in front of\nthe goal, there was Tsubasa. And I lost.\nI couldn't score.
After that, the coach and the other guys got real\nmad at me. Said I wasn't a team player,\nand that that's not how we do things.
They made me sit out the rest of the match\nto "think about what I did."
In the end, we lost 11-0. And after the match the\nrest of the team was out there sucking up to\nNankatsu. All smiles and everything.
I just thought if that's the kind of nonsense\nwe'd be doing instead of playing soccer,\nI might as well quit.
But right at that moment, as if he could hear\nwhat I was thinking, Tsubasa called out to me.
"If you love soccer, then don't quit."
I doubt he even remembers me,\nbut those words saved me.
Ever since then, I've taken that frustration\nand used it as motivation to get better.\nAnd I'm still going.
But after practicing with someone from Nankatsu\nlike you, I realized how much I still could be\ndoing.
Even someone as good as Tsubasa is practicing this\nhard, every day. Maybe he'll always be out of\nreach.
But after practicing with you like this,\nI finally understand where I really stand.
Jeez, what have I been doing all this time,\nwhen the best teams are practicing this hard?
Thanks. Seriously, I'm glad I met you.
I wrote down everything I told you, so when I get\nback home I'll tell Tamotsu, and we can come up\nwith a training program!
Oh, Tamotsu is that friend I mentioned before.\nThe one who knows a lot about soccer.
He's not too good at actually playing, though.
Anyway, you've really been doing incredible\nin this tournament, huh <avatar_name>?
At this rate, you might even get picked as a rep.\nMan, I'm jealous.
I'm just some nobody who's not even playing in the\ntournament. If only I had something, anything,\nthat could make me stand out.
Weren't you the best with that one skill\nin Japan?
You're better than anyone at something.
Eh?
Oh, you mean at juggling?\nBut how's that going to help me in a real match?
Better than anyone? Oh, you mean juggling?
I mean, I guess I won a lot of contests when I was\nyounger, but how's that going to help me in a real\nmatch?
No, wait, maybe I've just never tried to use it\nproperly.
You're right! Since I'm so good at it,\nthere has to be a way to take make use of it!
Alright! I'm gonna talk to Tamotsu about it,\nand we'll come up with something!
I can't thank you enough, <avatar_name>!\nI can finally see a way forward!
When I master my new move,\nyou'll be the first to see it!
In return, you'd better keep working hard\nand make it onto the All-Japan team!
I'll be cheering for you, so win for me, alright?
Ngh, figures...
Dangit! And I was so confident that time!
You've got a ways to go.
You were so close.
H-Hey! You don't get to say that!
Okay, let's do this again!\nThis time I'll use my trump card!
Hmm, yeah... It's time I stopped messing around.\nIt sucks to keep losing.
Okay, let's do this again!\nThis time I'm holding nothing back!
Here I come!
Now!
I did it! I really did it!
How about that?!\nI moved pretty well there, didn't I?
You got me good...
Please, teach me what you did!
Actually, that was my new dribble move I finally\nput together! Want to try it out?
Eh? Uh, sure, why not?
You really are a sponge when it comes to soccer.\nI need to develop the same habit.
You've already mastered my special move,\nso you shouldn't have any trouble.
Come to think of it, you didn't have any trouble\nwith flips when I was teaching you my special\nmove.
So maybe you'll pick this one up quick, too.
Okay, here we go. Watch what I do,\nand try to copy me.
No way!
Already? That easily?!\nBut that was the ace up my sleeve!
Dangit, I'm already being outdone!
Next time, I'll come up with a special move\nthat no one else can copy!
I'll surprise you with it if we ever end up facing\neach other on the field!
Anyway, make sure you use that dribble\nI just taught you in your next match, okay?
Hey! Over here!
Come on, pick up the pace!
Non-Stop Shingo Aoi does not stop!
I've been feeling pretty good today,\nlike I could keep running forever.
I was surprised you kept speeding up.
I thought I had good legs, too...
I did? I can't really tell myself,\nbut people say it's a bad habit of mine.
Well, you're not the only one. Whenever I get in\nthe groove, I can't help but shift into high gear.
Like, doesn't it feel great when you're dribbling\npast someone?
When I ride that high,\nI feel like I can always go even faster.
There's a sense of freedom, like you've opened\na gate into a wide open field.
And cutting deep into enemy territory gets you\na chance to score, right?
If you can run faster, there's no reason\nnot to speed up, is there?
Anyway, that's where the whole "non-stop" thing\ncomes in. Can't have one without the other!
Hyah!
Whoa, check out that dribbling!
Good, keep it up! Over here!
On it!
I can't believe I'm playing with guys from\nFurano MS! I really appreciate it!
No problem, it was fun.
I was wondering what kinda person you'd be when\n<avatar_name> said someone wanted to practice with\nus.
Never thought you'd be this good.\nThe captain and Oda are gonna regret missing out\non this to go scouting.
So anyway... Aoi, was it?\nThe way you play is just so... cheerful!
Seriously. How do I put this?\nI feel so encouraged with you on the field.
Thanks, I try!\nThat's exactly the feeling I want to get across.
Have you thought about trying to inspire others\nlike that too, <avatar_name>?
It's hard being younger...
I'm not a good speaker...
You're way overthinking this.
Age doesn't matter when it comes to helping out\nyour team.
Someone who's all talk wouldn't be able\nto embolden their team anyway.
You've been pushed by someone without words\nbefore, haven't you?
Like, say, someone is always pushing themselves\nharder or running around enjoying the game.
Just have fun when it's fun, be frustrated when\nit's frustrating, and celebrate when you're happy.
If you can show your sincerity in every play\nyou make, the people around you will respond.
I think that's probably the best way to\nhype up your team.
Makes sense.
In the end, the key is to just enjoy soccer\nwith every fiber of your being!
When you're the sun, everyone else brightens up!\nWell, that's how I think.
Ha!
Whoa, check out that dribbling!
Good, keep at it! This way!
On it!
I can't believe I'm playing with guys from\nMusashi MS! I really appreciate it!
No problem, it was fun.
I was wondering what kinda person you'd be when\n<avatar_name> said someone wanted to practice with\nus.
Never thought you'd be this good though.\nI wish the captain and Honma could've seen this.
So anyway... Aoi, was it?\nYour play style is just so... cheerful!
Seriously. How do I put this?\nI feel so encouraged with you on the field.
Thanks, I try!\nThat's exactly the feeling I want to get across.
Have you thought about trying to inspire others\nlike that too, <avatar_name>?

Hyah!
Whoa, check out that dribbling!
Okay, <avatar_name>! Let's charge in together!
I can't believe I'm playing with guys from\nToho Academy! I really appreciate it!
No problem, it was fun.
Anyway, I was wondering what kinda person you'd be\nwhen <avatar_name> said someone wanted to practice\nwith us.
Even compared to us,\nthe way you play is something special.
Thank you so much!\nThat's a huge confidence booster shot!
It's too bad though. I'm guessing you were really\nhoping to practice with the captain, right?\nBut he's got special training today.
Sure, I would've loved that...
But you're no slouch either. Training with anyone\nfrom Toho Academy is so helpful!
So anyway... Aoi, was it?\nThe way you play is just so... cheerful!
How do I put this? It's like the players around\nyou start playing harder, too.
Thanks, I try!\nThat's exactly what I try to encourage.
Have you thought about trying to inspire others\nlike that too, <avatar_name>?
It's hard being younger...
I'm not a good speaker...

Hyah!
Whoa, check out that dribbling!
Okay, <avatar_name>! Let's charge in together!
Bring it on!
I can't believe I'm playing with guys from\nOtomo MS! I really appreciate it!
No problem, it was fun.
Anyway, I was wondering what kinda person you'd be\nwhen <avatar_name> said someone wanted to practice\nwith us.
I can't believe there are still more people\nthis good out there.
Too bad Nitta and Urabe had to go check out\nour opponents today, though.
You're a second year like us, right Aoi?\nHeck, maybe you'll be our rival next year!
I sure hope so!
The way you play is just so... bright.
How do I put this? It's like the players around\nyou start playing harder, too.
Thanks, I try!\nThat's exactly what I try to encourage.
Have you thought about trying to inspire others\nlike that too, <avatar_name>?

Hyah!
Wow, check out that dribbling!
Okay, <avatar_name>! Let's charge in together!
I can't believe you guys from Nankatsu really\nagreed to play with me! Thank you so much.
No problem, we had a lot of fun, too. I think\nit'll really motivate the first and second years.
By the way Aoi, have we played each other before?
Tak! It was in the Tokai Soccer Festival!
I knew it! Seeing that dribble of yours reminded\nme. Um... Nakahara MS, right?
Wow, I can't believe you remembered.
But I'm guessing you were hoping to see Tsubasa,\nhuh? He's gotten even better since then.
Um, well, I can't deny that...
Hmm. Sorry, your timing was just bad. All the\nthird year regulars went back to Shizuoka first.
But you're no slouch either. Training with anyone\nfrom Nankatsu is going to be so helpful!
Still, the way you play...\nIt's like you bring a brightness to the field.
Thanks, I try!\nThat's exactly the feeling I want to get across.
Have you thought about learning from his attitude,\n<avatar_name>?
It's hard being younger...
I'm not a good speaker...
You're way overthinking this.

In the end, the key is to just enjoy soccer\nwith every fiber of your being!
When you're the sun, everyone else brightens up!\nWell, that's how I think.
Hey <avatar_name>! I made sure to watch all of\nJapan's games! You did great out there!
Seeing you beat Italy even though they were\nfavored to win blew me away!
Not just Italy, but the Netherlands, too?\nMan, I so wish I could've been there too!
You advanced to the finals tournament in first\nplace! The Japanese reps are amazing!\nIf only I could've been one...
So after Argentina is the semifinals, right?\nI thought it was just a dream, but you guys might\nactually win this whole thing!
Next up is the finals? I'm getting kinda nervous.\nI might actually get to see Japan win the whole\nthing!
Of course, I'm looking forward to seeing you in\naction the most! Seriously, win for me out there!
Anyway, I really did want to cheer you on,\nbut there's something else I have to tell you.
Actually, since we talked I've thought about what\nyou told me. Like, if I could come up with my own\nway to play using what I'm best at.
So I've been thinking and practicing,\nand thinking and practicing, and I finally got it!\nMy very own special move!
I know you're busy with the tournament, so maybe\nthe timing's bad, but maybe it'll help you out?
I'm sending over a video, so watch it when\nyou're taking a breather or something.\nThis is the fruit of my labor!
Are we recording, Tamotsu?
Okay, good.
Let's get started then! Presenting my new move!\nWatch closely, <avatar_name>!
Here goes nothing! I call it... the Juggle Circus!
Awesome! Nailed it!
How'd you like it? I took your advice\nand came up with my own original shot!
This never would've been possible without you.\nSo... how about showing it off on the world stage\nfor me?
I want to know just how far my move will go!\nI have a lot of faith in it!
I've also included an explanation of the trick and\nsome training methods in this video, so good luck!
Trying out something new, <avatar_name>?\nI've never seen you move like that before.
Oh, so that's it. Well, now I'm even more curious.
But the reason I have such high expectations is\nbecause you're a rep. You understand, right?
By the way, can you show me the video, too?
Oh ho. That's quite an imaginative shot.
It's not all flash either. It'll take a lot of\ntechnique, trying to pull that off in the middle\nof a game.
Very well then, keep practicing it. But if you run\ninto any problems, you can come to me for advice.
No need to be shy. I'm your coach, after all.
Hmm. It looks like the course of the ball when\nyou loft it is unstable.\nYou should work on that first.
Alright, looking good. Next you need to\ntake care with the finish.\nMiss that and the whole thing falls apart.
That was great! Remember how that felt\nand keep practicing.
With enough polish, I'm sure it'll work against\nthe best opponents. It'll be a wonderful trick\nto have.
Good work, <avatar_name>.\nYou should probably let your friend know.
Hey, <avatar_name>! Did you watch my video?
What? You already mastered it?!
Heh, that was nothing.
The coach helped me.
Y-You're kidding!
I mean, I'm the one who told you to,\nbut it's a bit irritating...
Oh, I see.\nYeah, it'd be way easier with someone helping.
Gah! If I'd been a rep,\nI'd have so many people to learn from!
I put all my skill into that shot.\nI already said this in the video,\nbut go and show it to the world!
I'm counting on you, <avatar_name>! Do it for me!
(There's nothing that warms my heart more than\nseeing youngsters help each other improve.)
(The boy from that video is pretty dedicated.\nThat footwork wasn't bad at all.)
(Maybe, just maybe... I can look forward\nto seeing more of him in the future.)














You're from the high-flying Tachibana brothers'\nteam, right? Hanawa MS?\nI think they called you <avatar_name>?
I saw you play the other day! I can't believe a\nfirst year got into the starting lineup of a team\nthat played at Nationals.
























Woohoo!
Gah! Check out that dribbling!
Good, more of that! This way!
Heck yeah!
I can't believe I'm playing with guys\nfrom Hanawa MS! I really appreciate it!
Same to you! This was really fun!
I was wondering what kinda person you'd be when\n<avatar_name> said someone wanted to practice\nwith us.
Never thought you'd be this good though.\nI wish Kazuo and Masao could've seen this.
Aoi, the way you play is just so cheerful.
Yeah. It's like you cheer up everyone around you.
Thanks, I try!\nThat's exactly the feeling I want to get across.
Have you thought about trying to inspire others\nlike that too, <avatar_name>?
It's hard being younger...
I'm not a good speaker...
You're way overthinking this.
Age doesn't matter when it comes to helping out\nyour team.

I think that's probably the best way to\nhype up your team.
Makes sense.
In the end, the key is to just enjoy soccer\nwith every fiber of your being!
When you're the sun, everyone else brightens up!\nWell, that's how I think.

You're from Jito's team, right? Hirado MS?\nI think they called you <avatar_name>?
I saw you play the other day! I can't believe a\nfirst year got into the legendary starting lineup\nat Hirado MS.


















Ha!
The heck?! Check out that dribbling!
Okay, <avatar_name>! Let's charge in together!
Bring it on!
I can't believe I got to play with guys from\nHirado MS! I really appreciate it!
Nah, it was a good time! Thanks for dropping by!
Anyway, I'd been wondering what kinda person you'd\nbe since <avatar_name> said someone wanted to\npractice with us.
I can't believe there are still more people\nthis good out there.
I'm sure if Jito and the others were here\nthey'd be super curious about your skills.
Hey, wait, you're a second-year, right?
Maybe you'll be Sano and <avatar_name>'s rival\nat Nationals next year!
Yep! That's what I'm hoping!
The way you play is just so... bright.
How do I put this? It's like the players around\nyou play harder because you're there.
Thanks, I try!\nThat's exactly the vibe I hope give off.
Have you thought about trying to inspire others\nlike that, <avatar_name>?










Makes sense.


Is that <avatar_name>?
What's wrong, <avatar_name>?\nYou stopped all of a sudden.
I feel like I'm being watched.
Never mind, it's nothing.
Really?
Well, you've been playing well.\nMaybe some team's doing recon from the stands.
Ya think? Well, okay then.
But if you're not feeling good, speak up, alright?
Take a break before it gets bad,\nand you'll recover quicker.
(Japan... My greatest rival in Asia.)
Were you watching us practice?
So you play for Saudi Arabia?
Wha...?
You noticed me in the middle of practice?\nAnd I thought I was being sneaky.
Huh? How did you know?
Oh, right. The jersey. It's written right there.
And here I thought I was being sneaky.\nThis is kinda embarrassing, actually...
Wait, so I should introduce myself.
Name's Mark Owairan, captain of the Saudi Arabian\nteam. It's a pleasure, <avatar_name>.
Wonder how I know your name?
I was watching Japan earlier, and you stood out,\nso I remembered your name.
Unfortunately, Saudi Arabia didn't make it past\nthe prelims.
So I figured I'd look into the other Asian team\nthat did.
I do ponder the difference between.\nTo know that would be useful.
If it's not too presumptuous would you visit\nour practice? I want to hear your opinions.
We might end up seeing you in the finals,\nand no way are we losing to another Asian team.
If that seems unfair, how about you come watch us\npractice? It's not against the rules.
It doesn't trouble me. It'll give us a reason\nto strive harder.
Prince Mark! Please don't run off by yourself!\nHow many times must I tell you?
Sorry, Al Zico. I'll be heading back for today.
Apologies, seems like I can't stay and chat.
Later, <avatar_name>.\nI hope I'll see you at our practice soon.
Hey, <avatar_name>.
I hate to tell you this after you came to see us,\nbut we've finished for the day.
There's no one else here,\nso how about we head down to the field?
I told my bodyguards I was expecting a friend.
You didn't get to see us practice,\nso shall we have a few kicks instead?
What's wrong?\nThat's the look of someone with questions.
That guy called you a prince?
What do you mean bodyguards?
Oh, that. Well, I am.\nI wasn't trying to hide anything.
Oh, I see. Most people wouldn't have them,\nwould they?
Born into the Owairan family, royal blood\nflows in my veins. So, I'm a prince.
Don't worry about formality. We're both soccer\nplayers. My status off the field is irrelevant.
We're a pair of guys who love soccer.\nThat's what matters.
I've been raised a prince my whole life\nwith everything I could want.\nBut something was missing.
One day, when I was riding my camel, I snuck into\ntown by myself, while everyone was distracted.
And there I found my heart. People of all ages\nand social strata were enjoying soccer together.
Compared to my daily life as a prince,\nit was a whole new world.
A world with a single ball, where race and class\ndidn't matter, where the game was its own reward.
They invited me to play too, and I kicked a ball\nfor the first time in my life. It was... fun.
For the first time I made friends with people\nwho didn't care I was a prince.\nThat was my first encounter with soccer.
I was hoping we could share that relationship,\ntoo...
That's enough talk.\nWe should get to know each other on the field.\nYou'd prefer that, wouldn't you?
Now, let's get started!
Ugh... My eyes didn't deceive me. You're good!
But don't think I'll sit still!\nI'm done observing!
See? I'm no pushover!
Thank you, friend.\nTime always flies when you're having fun.
You're just what I'd expect from a regular on a\nfinals team. You're not easily deceived.
You're just what I'd expect from a regular on a\nsemfinals team. You're not easily deceived.
You're just what I'd expect from a regular on a\nteam undefeated in prelims.\nYou're not easily deceived.
You're just what I'd expect from a regular on\nthe dark horse Japanese team.\nGlad to see you're not easily deceived.
I feel like you've gotten even better than\nyou were when I went to watch you practice.
I'm sure being surrounded by such great players\nhas helped you grow.
Oh, you're interested in that dribble I used\nearlier?
I see. So that's your secret:\na greed to soak up technique.
How is it done?
Alright, I'll teach you. Think of it as a sign\nof our burgeoning friendship.
I've certainly received adequate schooling\nfrom watching you play.
But it grows late, so we'll have to do it\nsome other time. Stop by whenever you like.
I'll walk you back to your dormitory.
Of course, my bodyguards will come too,\nbut don't mind them.
Defenders! You're far too slow cornering\nan opponent! Don't give them a free shot!
And forwards! Those shots were pathetic!\nNo skilled goalie would let those through!
Yes, Captain!
Alright! Keep a tight defensive line this time!\nDon't forget to sync up!
Offense keep talking and find a way to break\nthe defense.
We need more offensive plays to score\non these international teams!
Yes, Captain!
Hey, you came <avatar_name>!\nI've been waiting for you.
You watched us practice this afternoon, right?\nSo, thoughts?
I'm curious about what our Saudi Arabian soccer\nlooks like through your eyes.
I think you'd be a tough opponent.
Hmm...
Thank you.
But spare me your flattery.\nMy eyes see well enough.
Japan was magnificent in your game the other day.\nAs we are now, we'd be no match for you.
Say no more. Your silence speaks volumes.
It's an unfortunate reality we didn't have what\nit takes to make it through prelims.\nAs much as it frustrates me, you're right.
In this tournament, I've seen where I stand\nwith the best in the world.\nI feel more confident actually.
But I can't say the same for the team as a whole.\nWe still fall far short of the international\nstage.
Not to say that they aren't fine players on their\nown. What we lack are strategies, coordination,\nand balance.
In particular, our defense was ineffective.\nWe simply weren't prepared for the individual\ntalent at the top of the world.
But in return, it's shined a spotlight on our\nweaknesses. It's been an incredible experience.
And more than that... I met you.\nWhat a stroke of luck.
Every time you practiced, every game you played,\nyou became better and better.
I'm sure part of it was your instincts\nand your hunger for new techniques...
But most important was your love of the game.\nFrom what I can tell, that's why your mind\nand feet move so fast.
But I know for a fact that everyone on the\nSaudi Arabian team loves soccer just as much.
I don't believe for a second that we aren't\ncapable of what I saw out there from you.
Which is why we'll catch up with you someday.\nWe'll be nipping at your heels.
One day we'll face each other, and Saudi Arabia\nwill ride in on a brilliant sandstorm!
Anyway, since you came all this way, want to kick\nthe ball around? I would treasure one more such\nconversation.
Now, are you coming or not?
Hey there, <avatar_name>. Practicing your shots?
You've got quite the knack. I can hardly believe\nyou're years don't match my own.
But it seems to me you're having a hard time\nbalancing power and control.
In particular, when focusing on controlling\nyour shots you step off the gas on power.
Unity is power. I could give you some pointers\nif you like.
Don't you play defense, Owairan?
Is that even your area?
True, but I'm quite confident in my shooting...\nfor a defender.
Perhaps not. I am a defender,\nso I understand your skepticism.
Pass me the ball and I'll demonstrate.
Here I go!
Haha!
My mental image when shooting is so clear that\nthe densest sandstorm could blur it.
So? Still doubting my skills?
Thank you. I'll try to teach you what I can then.
Good, you've stabilized your shot. All that's left\nis to add the power you already have.
I knew you had the knack for this.\nRemember, the weapon first, the fight second.
Great! That was perfect! Try to remember exactly\nhow that felt!
Hmm? How can you pay me back?
I don't need anything. The feeling of working hard\nalongside other enthusiasts is all I need.
Actually, I've been observing other top class\nplayers for reference myself.
Who knows? Maybe I'll master these techniques\nand reveal them in a match against you someday.
As fellow Asians, I certainly don't intend\nto fall behind Japan.
Seeing you improve has been a great motivator.\nLet's meet again when fortune permits.
Hey there, <avatar_name>.\nHeading off to watch someone else practice?
Oh? You're here for me?
Unfortunate timing then. Actually, there's\na charity event soon that I need to attend.
Oh, I know. Would you accompany me?
Don't worry, it's nothing too fancy, we're just\ngoing to be spreading the joy of soccer.
Being able to make friends around the world\nthrough soccer is a blessed thing.
That's why I signed up for this event as soon as\nI heard of it.
Wait, you've done this before?
So you're proactive about this stuff, too.\nThat's splendid.
Then we should absolutely go together!
Charity events are very important, and I think\nthey're a good way to learn about the world.
Not to mention how relaxing it is to just enjoy\nsoccer for its own sake amid all these fierce\nmatches.
Okay, let's go together then.
Wow, this is a bigger event than I thought.\nLooks like there're attendees from the world over.
If it isn't <avatar_name>.\nI didn't know you would be here.
An acquaintance of yours?\nI'll just be over there for a moment.
Wasn't that Mark Owairan, captain of the\nSaudi Arabian team?
I never imagined you two would know each other.
Oh, I see. He must have invited you here.
I'd heard he was the prince of his country.\nHe certainly seems a decent fellow.\nYou could learn a lot from him.
I see...\nSo we were both taken in by the charms of soccer.
Exactly. In soccer, region, status, and wealth\nare all meaningless.\nI'm glad that opinion isn't unique to me.
I was thinking the same thing. It was worth\ncoming here today, if only to meet you.
Quite right. Shall we start spreading the charms\nof soccer to as many people as possible?
Yes. Let's make the event one to remember!
Next, the players will demonstrate dribbling!
Just try and stop me, <avatar_name>!
The trick behind that is to make it look like\nyou've lost your balance and take advantage of\nthe opponent's shock.
This sort of outside-the-box thinking is one of\nsoccer's many charms.
That went well, don't you think?\nEveryone seemed to enjoy it.
What's wrong, <avatar_name>?\nYou seem very serious all of a sudden.
I need that dribble!
Did you use me to show off?!
Oh, that?
Hmm. Well, you did come with me to the charity\nevent on short notice...
Alright then, I'll teach you.\nStinginess devalues man and all.
Huh? No no no, that's not how I meant it.
But you're right. I'm sorry for pushing that\nrole on you after inviting you on short notice.
By way of apology, how about I teach you\nhow to do that move yourself?
Okay, that settles it. Shall we head back to the\nfield? We should still have time to work on it.
Those movements make it obvious that you're\nlofting the ball.
To confuse the opponent, you must make it look\nlike you've lost your balance.\nIt'll put your acting chops to the test!
You kicked the ball too high.\nControl exactly where it'll land so you can\nstart dribbling right out of the roll.
In order to do that, you need to keep perfect\nbalance while looking like you've lost it.
Alright, one more time!
That was marvelous! I thought I'd only be\nintroducing you, but you've already mastered it!
At today's event, we made a lot of people's eyes\nshine at the joys of soccer.
But you might have been the person\nwho's been having the most fun all along.
Enjoyment unlocks the door to improvement...\nI still have a lot to learn.
Alright, split up into teams for a practice match!
Yes, Captain!
Hello, <avatar_name>. I saw you arrive.
Mind if we observe together?
Saudi Arabia... They seem to be having a tough\ntime in the tournament, but they appear fairly\ncoordinated.
Saudi Arabia... Unfortunately they couldn't make\nit through the prelims, but now they don't seem\nlike a bad team.
And their captain is the Prince of the Desert,\nMark Owairan.\nLooks like he's keeping the team together.
Like I told you earlier, I want you to learn\nfrom him and not just on the field.
As I indicated, I want you to keep on eye on how\nhe acts off the field.
Hmm, looks like they're starting. Let's watch.
Gotcha! It's too obvious where you're passing!
Now, let's start the counterattack!
Yes, Captain!
Now's my chance!
Okay, that went well.\nNow let's get right back to it!
Just as I thought.\nOwairan controls the game from beginning to end.
So? Any thoughts?\nHow did you feel about Owairan just now?
He's wasted on defense.
Does he trust his teammates?
Hmm...
True, with his speed, technique, and tactics\nhe'd be good at controlling midfield.
This is just my speculation, but I feel he\nprobably chooses to play defense out of a sense\nof duty.
You doubt it?\nI see a boy devoting everything to his team.
In my estimation, I feel he's taking on the burden\nof both offense and defense out of a sense of\nduty.
In a way, the captain is the "king" of his team.\nSo he put himself in the back,\nwhere he can oversee the battle.
No doubt he thinks that's the most reliable way\nto help them win.
On defense, he both leads and is a last line of\ndefense, and on offense he leads the charge,\nso to speak.
Of course, this is still just me speculating.
I'm sorry, this must all be a bit confusing at\npresent. But you'll understand soon enough.
For a libero to play both offense and defense at a\nhigh level, you need to know exactly when to rest,\nand when to run.
It's fine to just follow the example of others\nat first.
But someday, I hope you'll be a king like him,\nleading your country.
Hey there, <avatar_name>.
Are you here to watch Saudi Arabia practice, too?
Personally, I'm interested in their playstyle.\nI mean, did you see the match between them\nand Brazil?
Even if Brazil were playing worse than usual,\nSaudi Arabia's tactics kept them in the game for\nthe first half. And is worth looking into.
Oh, looks like they're starting.\nLet's watch together.
Okay, we're starting! First we'll be practicing\nbuilding pressure fast on an opponent!\nOur formation is the key!
Yes, Captain!
No, not like that! You need to corner them faster!\nDon't give them an inch!
At this rate they'd just break through our net\nlike what happened with Argentina or Brazil!
Yes, Captain!
I'm sure you've already noticed this,\n<avatar_name>.
But what Saudi Arabia is going for\nis group defense tactics.
The goal is to quickly surround the opponent with\nmultiple defenders in order to keep up pressure\nand steal the ball.
It's one of the basics of soccer, but to actually\napply it at a high level takes a lot of skill.
That's because the player giving the order needs\nto be able to judge the perfect timing to begin\nthe approach.
And if you don't want the opponent to just pass\nor slip their way through, each of the defenders\nneeds a lot of skill, too.
Since Saudi Arabia is another Asian country, I'm\nsure we'll be seeing a lot of them in the future.\nTake careful notes.
(Looks like <avatar_name> stopped by again.\nBut that's unusual, he has company this time.)
(I wonder what they think of our\nAntlion Defense...)
(No, I shouldn't be worrying about that right now.\nWhat does it even matter if we still haven't\nperfected it?)
(We'll polish this to a shine before we show it\noff to the world! And on that day, they'll see\nsome legendary Saudi Arabian soccer!)
Alright guys, break time's over! Let's practice so\nhard we forget our humiliation in the tournament!
Yes, Captain!
Aw, man! It's cats and dogs out!
The weather report mentioned evening showers,\nbut this is a monsoon.
So, are we doing a practice match or what?
Are you serious?\nWe could drown trying to play in this!
It could be fun!
They don't cancel matches for rain.
That's so like you, <avatar_name>.
Figured you'd say something like that.
I suppose you're right, but I mean...
See? <avatar_name> gets it!
A rain game, huh? I remember gettin' good\nand muddy a few times in elementary school.
One moment it seems like a drizzle,\nbut the next it turns into a downpour.
Of course, once you get wet,\nno reason not to keep going.
Yeah, I remember that.
My mom used to chew me out so much for coming home\ncaked in mud...
But it's no big once you get movin'.\nThe game is all that matters then.
Come to think of it, being in the rain\nends up being a plus.
Definitely. Even if the pitch is wet,\nthat doesn't affect our air game.
We may not end up having matches in the rain,\nbut it can't hurt to practice for them anyway!
Well, let's give it a shot!\nDon't twist any ankles.
Let's ready some towels, so we can dry off\nin the locker room when we finish.\nCan't go catching a cold.
And don't overdo it if you're not feeling well! No\nneed to dive hard if you aren't feeling top notch.
The other clubs are gonna think we're nuts\ngetting on the pitch in this weather.
Let 'em! Soccer doesn't give a spit about rain!
Hey, the rain's letting up!
Alright, everyone! Time for a mud bath!\nLet's get out there!
Woohoo!
Everyone ended up coming out to the pitch,\ndidn't they?
Love of the game!
I guess that makes us soccer freaks. Good stuff!
Well, let's get back at it!
Hey, got a minute?
You're that <avatar_name> from Furano MS,\nain'tcha?
You're that <avatar_name> from Musashi MS,\nain'tcha?
You're that <avatar_name> from Toho Academy,\nain'tcha?
You're that <avatar_name> from Otomo MS,\nain'tcha?
You're that <avatar_name> from Nankatsu MS,\nain'tcha?
You're that <avatar_name> from Hanawa MS,\nain'tcha?
Huh? Who are you?
Y-You're a giant!
Oh, my bad, I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Taichi Nakanishi, goalie for Naniwa MS\nin Osaka.
I s'pose I do make a pretty big impression.\nAin't that many middle schoolers bigger'n me.
I'm Taichi Nakanishi, goalie for Naniwa MS\nin Osaka.
Anywho, 'nuff about me.
I saw ya in a match the other day.\nThought ya were pretty dang good.
I was mad impressed with ya pullin' off plays\nthat big in one of the country's top teams,\nand as an underclassman to boot.
I'd love to face ya, but Furano MS schooled us\ngood, so it ain't happenin'. Sucks.
I was mad impressed with the way ya were playin'\nlike Musashi MS veterans, even though you just\nstarted.
I'd love to face ya, but Musashi MS schooled us\ngood, so it ain't happenin'. Sucks.
A freshman throwin' out plays on the same level as\nthe starting lineup of those big time schools...\nYou're hardcore.
I'd love to go up against ya, to be honest,\nbut Toho Academy ended up bein' in a different league\nfrom us, so it ain't happenin'. Sucks.
Ya were givin' your upperclassmen a run for their\nmoney with some fierce plays, and as a first year,\ntoo. I was mad impressed.
I'd love to go up against ya, to be honest,\nbut Otomo MS ended up bein' in a different league\nfrom us, so it ain't happenin'. Sucks.
A freshman throwin' out plays on the same level\nas Nankatsu's starting lineup... You're hardcore.
I'd love to go up against ya, to be honest,\nbut y'guys ended up bein' in a different league\nfrom us, so it ain't happenin'. Sucks.
You blew me away with the way ya played\nin a Nationals-level school like Hanawa MS,\nand as a first year, too.
I'd love to go up against ya, to be honest,\nbut y'guys ended up bein' in a different league\nfrom us, so it ain't happenin'. Sucks.
Then let's go a round. You and me!
I'd like to see what you're made of.
A one-on-one match? That ain't a bad idea.
Schedules bein' what they are, we probably can't\nget our teams together, but if it's just us,\nwe can do that.
Okay then! You're on!
Dang, okay. I 'preciate you sayin' that.
I kinda wanted to see what you could do myself.
Let's have a one-on-one, then. What do ya say?
It'd probably be pretty tough getting our teams'\nschedules to line up, but if it's just us,\nwe're good, right?
Lemme give ya my contact info. Let me whenever\nya want to throw down. I'll be waitin'.
Peace.
No matter what I do it doesn't work.
Oh, <avatar_name>! 'Sup? Thanks for gettin' back\nto me.
Sorry, though.\nI don't have it in me to play today.
You do look a little under the weather.
Are you chickening out?
Yeah, sorry my dude.
Naniwa's been havin' a heck of a time in this\ntournament. We keep losin'. Not in the mood for\na match right now.
I suppose that is the case.
Thing is, this tournament's been real tough.\nNaniwa keeps losin' and, well, it's done a\nnumber on my confidence.
Were you off your game?
Are you guys just plain bad?
Eh, somethin' like that.
The team, myself included, we couldn't really\nbring our A game to the tournament.
Say what?!
...You're probably right, though.\nWe just weren't good enough.
We lost to Azumaichi MS at the Osaka Regional\nfinals this past summer, and didn't go on to\nNationals.
So, yeah, we were gonna go all out against the\nbig time schools from Nationals this time.
Unfortunately, most of the schools I wanted to go\nup against ended up outta our league.
So I was like, okay, I can play hard\nand come out a rep.
But, all those teams that played around the\ncountry and in Nationals, they were way better\nthan I imagined.
When we went up against Minamiuwa, Ishida\nstraight up ruled the midfield with his technique,\nand Takei's headers did me in.
Against Meiwa Higashi, what got us was that\nSliding Squad and the ruckus they raised right\nin front of the goal.
When we played Hanawa MS, the Tachibana Bros combo\nliterally made circles around us.
In the match with Otomo MS, I couldn't block\nthat Nitta guy's direct shots.
Then with Hirado MS, Jito wrecked our ace,\njust like during the Osaka Regionals!
And then there was Soda from Azumaichi\nand what he did in the Osaka Regionals.
When we went up against Minamiuwa, Ishida\nstraight up ruled the midfield with his technique,\nand Takei's headers did me in.
Against Meiwa Higashi, what got us was that\nSliding Squad and the ruckus they raised right\nin front of the goal.
Against Musashi MS, Misugi saw through every last\none of my plays, and their three forwards threw us\nfor a loop and a half.
When we played Hanawa MS, the Tachibana Bros combo\nliterally made circles around us.
Then with Hirado MS, Jito wrecked our ace,\njust like during the Osaka Regionals!

Against Meiwa Higashi, what got us was that\nSliding Squad and the ruckus they raised right\nin front of the goal.
With Furano MS, they were super unified around\nMatsuyama, and that persistence won 'em the game.

Then with Hirado MS, Jito wrecked our ace,\njust like during the Osaka Regionals!
And then there was Soda from Azumaichi\nand what he did in the Osaka Regionals.
Things just aren't going my way. It feels like\nsomeone took a huge chunk outta my heart.
I know I'm no good like this but, ya know...
So, you'll quit soccer in middle school?
Sounds like you're wimpin' out.
Oh, heck no! I'm still gonna play when I go\nto high school, and one day I'm goin' pro.
Ah!
I get it now!
Nothin's gonna come from feeling sorry for myself\nwhen things ain't going my way.
If I've got time for that, I should be looking for\nhow to be better in the future and work hard.
Say that again, punk!
Wait!
...I think I get what you're tryin' to say.
I guess I can despair a little easily at times.\nMaybe that's why I lost?
...
Yeah, it won't do any good to get down\nin the dumps when things don't go well.
This rotten situation is a perfect chance to be\ntougher. Future me is countin' on it!
Thanks, <avatar_name>.\nYa helped me snap out of it.
I'll only get left behind if I'm wallowing while\neveryone else is getting whipped into shape.
I'm gonna keep my chin up! There's still so much\nI can do movin' forward!
I'll need some more time before I'm ready\nto really take ya on, though.
I'll practice hard to toughen up my body and mind!
When I get my strength back I'll bring it 100%!
Now that that's settled, it's time to practice!\nTrain with me, man!
Here goes, Nakanishi!
I'm ready! Sock it to me, Matsuyama!
Agh! So, this is that champ shooting power!
Thanks for agreein' to a match with me.
No problem. I had fun squaring up against\none of the best goalies around.
Still, I'm surprised you knew Nakanishi,\n<avatar_name>. Seriously, is there anyone\nyou don't know?
Well, ya got me today, but ya better believe\nI'll stop that shot of yours next time!
Not happening. See, I'm gonna be way better\nby the time we have another match!
Captain! Try some shots on me, too! I...\nI can't go losing to Nakanishi!
Sure thing!
Well, see ya later, Nakanishi!
Yep! See ya on the pitch in high school!
Thanks a bunch for goin' out of your way\nto meet up with me today, <avatar_name>.
Ya were right. Mopin' around wasn't gonna do me\nany good in the long run.
So, I figured I oughta do what I could to up my\ngame for high school.
And I had this idea to go around to other schools'\ntrainin' grounds and have all sortsa players shoot\nat me.
I gotta say, though. I was blown away by\nMatsuyama's shot. The way it hugs the ground\nwhile bein' so powerful...!
It really drove home how much more I gotta improve\nif I wanna be the number one goalie in the\ncountry.
So, let's do this. I promised you a match\nand I'm ready to deliver!
I'm as strong as I was before. Actually, no,\nI'm even stronger, and I'm gonna prove it!
Hope you're ready, Nakanishi!
Ready and waiting, Misugi!
Ngh. That shot was pretty as heck.\nNo wonder they call you a prodigy!
Thanks for today, man.
My pleasure. I enjoyed getting to go up against\none of the top goalies out there.
That said, you guys know each other?\nYou're quite the people person, <avatar_name>.
Well, ya got me today, but ya better believe\nI'll stop that shot of yours next time!
I'm going to keep training. Gotta keep up with\nyou! I look forward to seeing where we go!
Captain! Mukai wants to talk to you.\nSomething about the defense.
Sure, be there in a minute.
See you on the field next time, Nakanishi.
Yep! See ya in high school!
Thanks a bunch for goin' out of your way\nto meet up with me today, <avatar_name>.
Ya were right. Mopin' around wasn't gonna do me\nany good in the long run.
So, I figured I oughta do what I could to up my\ngame for high school.
And I had this idea to go around to other schools'\ntrainin' grounds and have all sortsa players shoot\nat me.
And boy, Misugi's shot... The way the ball curved\nas if it was tryin' to sneak by me and headed for\nthe corner... Insane.
It really drove home how much more I gotta improve\nif I wanna be the number one goalie in the\ncountry.
So, let's do this. I promised you a match\nand I'm ready to deliver!
I'm as strong as I was before. Actually, no,\nI'm even stronger, and I'm gonna prove it!
Ready or not, Nakanishi!
Bring it on, Hyuga!
Whoa. That was some intense power. The hand I\ntried to stop it with is still shakin' and kinda\nnumb.
Thanks for today, Hyuga. I owe ya one.
Don't mention it.\nI was curious if you could handle my kicks.
What gets me is that you two know each other.\nMan, <avatar_name>, it's like you know everyone.
I lost today, but next time,\nI'm stoppin' your Tiger Shot no matter what!
Doubt it. I'm winning next time, too.
Hey, Captain! Use your Tiger Shot on me, too!
You asked for it. I'm comin'!
See you on the field next time, Nakanishi.
Yep! Catch ya when we play in high school!
Thanks a bunch for goin' out of your way\nto meet up with me today, <avatar_name>.
Ya were right. Mopin' around wasn't gonna do me\nany good in the long run.
So, I figured I oughta do what I could to up my\ngame for high school.
And I had this idea to go around to other schools'\ntrainin' grounds and have all sortsa players shoot\nat me.
Hyuga's Tiger Shot, though... If that's not our\ngeneration's ace striker's strongest shot,\nI don't even know.
It really drove home how much more I gotta improve\nif I wanna be the number one goalie in the\ncountry.
So, let's do this. I promised you a match\nand I'm ready to deliver!
I'm as strong as I was before. Actually, no,\nI'm even stronger, and I'm gonna prove it!
Here I go, Nakanishi!
Yep! Show me what you got, Nitta!
Dang. I thought speed was your thing,\nbut the power you put into that was intense!
Thanks for doin' this for me, Nitta.
No, thank YOU! When Urabe told me about you,\nI knew I had to try taking you on.
But the fact that you guys knew each other?\nJeez, <avatar_name>, who don't you know?
Well, ya got me this time, but don't think I won't\nbe able to stop your Falcon Shot next time!
We'll see. I'm only getting better!
Nitta! Train with me next!
Sure. Be right there.
See ya in a match sometime, Nakanishi!
Yep! See ya on the pitch in high school!
Thanks a bunch for goin' out of your way\nto meet up with me today, <avatar_name>.
Ya were right. Mopin' around wasn't gonna do me\nany good in the long run.
So, I figured I oughta do what I could to up my\ngame for high school.
And I had this idea to go around to other schools'\ntrainin' grounds and have all sortsa players shoot\nat me.
Still, Nitta's Falcon Shot was crazy fast.\nAnd don't get me started on him hitting it\nfrom a volley.
It really drove home how much more I gotta improve\nif I wanna be the number one goalie in the\ncountry.
So, let's do this. I promised you a match\nand I'm ready to deliver!
I'm as strong as I was before. Actually, no,\nI'm even stronger, and I'm gonna prove it!
Sup, <avatar_name>. Sorry to bug ya.
I've got a huge favor to ask ya.
Here's the deal...
Hey <avatar_name>. And, oh wow, Nakanishi!
Been a while, Tsubasa.
Huh. So, you guys knew each other?\nYou're just friends with everyone, <avatar_name>.
Anyway, what brings you here?
Well, I had <avatar_name> bring me here since\nI got a favor to ask ya.
What can I help you with?
I know this is gonna seem really random,\nbut I want ya to use your Drive Shot on me!
Oh?
I'd made it my goal to do like Wakabayashi and win\nNationals with a total shutout in elementary\nschool. But you brought an end to that.
...
That loss was so frustrating that I got bent on\nbeating ya. It's what's helped me work so hard up\ntil now.
And I was thinking this would be the year, but\nthen we lost at the Osaka Regionals and that was\nthat.
What's worse, ya guys got put in a different group\nin the Junior Hero League.
...
And you're goin' to Brazil after graduatin'\nfrom middle school to become a pro, right?
That means we won't get to play against each other\nfor a good while.
So, can we have a match before you go? Just one!
I wanna know how much the work I've done over\nthe past three years is worth!
Nakanishi...
...
Let's do this.
For real?!
Yeah.
Here we go, Nakanishi!
Ready, Tsubasa!
Łoł!
...
...
That was definitely the shot that won Nationals.\nWish we coulda had a proper match.
Thanks, Tsubasa.
I know what level I'm at now, and the gap\nI need to cross. That's super clear.
It's gonna be real hard bridging it,\nbut it's good to have a goal.
Nakanishi...
Tsubasa, you go to Brazil and bust your butt\nto go pro.
You can bet I'll be bustin' mine here in\nhigh school soccer to do the same, for sure.
Then we'll have ourselves a real match!\nBe ready to lose come that day!
We'll see about that! But I'll be looking forward\nto facing off with you!
Thanks a lot for today, <avatar_name>.
I got to have some closure on the last three years\nof hard work through that match with Tsubasa.
And starting tomorrow,\nI got a new future to chase!
I'm just glad I got to help.
So it goes, I guess?
We won't get to play this time around, but when we\ndo, I guarantee I'll have something to show ya!\nSomethin' to look forward to, eh?
So it does. You'll see what I mean someday.
Anyway, you've been killin' it. The way you're\ngoin', you're gonna nab rep, no questions asked.
As for me, I hate to admit it,\nbut my chances of getting rep are slim to none.
Still, doesn't mean I've given up on the future.\nIf I keep workin' hard, I'll get my shot\neventually.
And I kinda owe it to ya, since ya turned me\ninto some kinda optimist. Seriously, thanks.
Also, I'm rootin' for ya. You gotta work real hard\nand aim to be the best player in Japan!
Here we go, Nakanishi!
Ready as I'll ever be!
It's on! You're about to see what we can do!
Ack... What a shot! The ball looked like\nit was swingin' all over the place.\nIt threw me for a loop.
Thank you guys for agreein' to a lil match with\nme.
Sure thing. We'd been wanting to take you on.
Also, <avatar_name>, I didn't know you knew\nNakanishi. You're a regular social butterfly.
Ya guys did me in today, but I'll stop your\nTwin Shot next time, you'll see!
That's what you think!
Yeah. Our combo is always getting better!
Masao, Kazuo, coach is looking for you guys!
Okay. We'll be there in a sec!
Hey, Nakanishi, let's meet again at a match!
Yep! See ya on the pitch in high school!
Thanks a bunch for goin' out of your way\nto meet up with me today, <avatar_name>.
Ya were right. Mopin' around wasn't gonna do me\nany good in the long run.
So, I figured I oughta do what I could to up my\ngame for high school.
And I had this idea to go around to other schools'\ntrainin' grounds and have all sortsa players shoot\nat me.
The Tachibana Bros hit me with the Twin Shot\ntoday, and they've still got the Skylab Hurricane.\nThose two are somethin' else.
It really drove home how much more I gotta improve\nif I wanna be the number one goalie in the\ncountry.
So, let's do this. I promised you a match\nand I'm ready to deliver!
I'm as strong as I was before. Actually, no,\nI'm even stronger, and I'm gonna prove it!
Aight, hit me with your best shot!
You may be big, but I'll power through!
Your size must make it hard\nto cover the whole goal!
Ya may be confident in your strength but there's\nstill no way you're gettin' my body to budge!
Oh, ya think 'cause I'm built like a brick wall\nI move like one?
Bad call, bro. I've got the moves to cover\nevery inch of this goal!
Hey, don't let it get to ya.
You know what? I've got time today.\nLet's do this right!
Come on. Shoot away!
That was a pretty good bout today,\nand I owe ya a thanks for that.
Anyway, you've been killin' it. The way you're\ngoin', you're gonna nab rep, no questions asked.
As for me, I hate to admit it,\nbut my chances of getting rep are slim to none.
Still, doesn't mean I've given up on the future.\nIf I keep workin' hard, I'll get my shot\neventually.
And I kinda owe it to ya, since ya turned me\ninto some kinda optimist. Seriously, thanks.
Also, I'm rootin' for ya. You gotta work real hard\nand aim to be the best player in Japan!
Oof, that was like a perfect counter right there.\nHe took the pass from his team and nailed the\ndirect shot.
When trapping before shooting, there's a lull in\nthe attack, givin' the defendin' opponent a chance\nto feel the rhythm.
Guess ya gotta give props to the passer\nand whoever took the direct shot, too.
Here's the rub, <avatar_name>, how a counter goes\ndepends on how fast you can make the attack\nhappen.
So, don't forget that it ain't just the shot.\nThe pass is also super important!
Come on, <avatar_name>!
Was that really all you could dish out?\nSeemed kinda halfhearted.
What's eatin' ya? You're givin' me sad vibes.
The way you beat me one-on-one...
Sad? What? Where?
Well, that's exactly what I was goin' for.
Say what ya will, it's written all over your face.
I make an effort to body block those shots where\nmy opponent is sure they got me beat.\nTotally shut 'em down.
When they see their full power get blocked so\nperfectly, it sends a shock to their system,\njust like it did for you.
And this ain't something only goalies can do,\neither.
I'm pretty sure players on the field can send\na similar shock by blockin' shots.
Such decisive shutdowns are a sure fire way\nto dampen the other team's spirit.
Come to think of it, didn't you pull off a pretty\nawesome block in a recent match?
Why don'tcha give it a try? Next time you play\na match, try and block in a way that leaves\nno doubts.
Remember, you're trying to throw 'em off their\ngame. It'll make you a much more terrifying\nopponent.
Hmm...
Sup, <avatar_name>?
Oh? Ya wanna know what I was watchin'?
I was just goin' over a recording of the first\nmatch in the Junior Hero League. Seein' how I did.
When we're winnin', my moves are slick and I'm\ndishing out calls to my teammates, no problem.
But if I mess up or they turn the tables on us,\nI have a tough time gettin' back in the groove.
It's somethin' I've struggled with\nsince elementary school.
Against Nankatsu SC in the elementary school\nNationals I was doin' awesome when we had the\nlead, but then Tsubasa flipped the script.
I got in my head and it did a number on my ability\nto make calls and on my plays in general.
I know I can't be like this, but I just can't seem\nto, I dunno, train my brain.
Never stop winning and you're golden!
You could swap out if you start losing.
Only play when you're winning?
I wish I could be so hopeful...
I mean, that'd be nice, but it doesn't always\ngo that way, does it?
I s'pose if I was a coach I'd switch myself out.
Wha...?
Oh, I get it. Step in when we're winnin'\nand hold the lead.
That's pretty temptin' from a coach's standpoint,\nbut as a player, it's kind of a downer.
Oh, shoot, look at the time.\nShould be gettin' back to the dorms.
Peace out.
Argh, what's that goalie doin' just spacin' out?!
He has to steer the defenders.\nThe field is wide open for a shot!
You see?! The defenders couldn't block on time\nand he got scored on.
Are the defenders missing a step?
Helps to see the whole field, right?
I guess that's part of it, but the goalie sees the\nmatch from the very back. He can see how the other\nteam's movin' better than anyone.
If he'd called out to the defenders, they could've\nclosed up that opening a couple moments earlier\nand blocked that shot.
I've been a goalie for a pretty long time. I have\na good idea of what the game would look like from\nthe pitch.
If the goalie had called out to the defenders,\nthey coulda closed up that openin' a couple\nmoments earlier and blocked the shot.
I know you're not a goalie,\nbut you've played some defense.
If you spot an openin' for a shot, don't wait for\nthe goalie to make a call. Sometimes ya gotta give\nyour teammates instructions yourself.
Age doesn't matter when you're on the pitch.\nDon't be scared to shout, even if your teammates\nhave a few years on you.
Stoppage time: Second Half\nNaniwa MS leads 1-0
Just a little more to go! I don't care what it\ntakes, I'm holding the line!
I'm not letting anything through!
Yeah, boy! We won! We did it, you guys!
The score was one to zero,\nbut that was a total win for Naniwa MS.
They'd been struggling during the tournament,\nbut they saw this win through.
They got their point from that long pass from\nNakanishi. He can really put the ball in the air.
He had some serious control over it, too.\nIt went right where his teammate needed it.
And the defense after that, especially his calls\nto block shots, were on point. Lots to learn from\ntoday.
<avatar_name>, soccer isn't just about moving the\nball up and attacking. Playmaking like Nakanishi\ndid today is also key.
Even if you're not a goalie, you'd do well to\nstudy the way Naniwa MS played today.
Today's match ended at one to zero, but let's be\nreal. Naniwa MS were never in trouble.
They'd been going through it during the\ntournament, but they finally pulled through\nthis time.
How they scored from Nakanishi's long pass was\nincredible. The distance was nuts, sure, but the\ncontrol let the play develop it perfectly.
The defense afterwards was the cherry on top.\nHe guided his teammates and helped them maneuver\nexpertly.
<avatar_name>, in soccer, you don't always have\nto move the ball up and attack.\nYou can make plays the way Nakanishi did today.
Even if you're not a goalie, it's probably a good\nidea to study the way Naniwa MS played today.
The score was one to nothing, but that was a win\nfor Naniwa MS, hands down.
Nakanishi was having a pretty tough time this\ntournament, but he was amazing out there today.
They got their point from that long pass from\nNakanishi. He can really put the ball in the air.
It made it very clear how important the set up all\nthe way from the keeper is. Good to remember that.
And his defensive calls after that were perfect.\nTrying to shoot when the defense is on you like\nthat can't be easy.
<avatar_name>, there's all kinda of ways to play\nsoccer. Nakanishi showed us some serious\nplaymaking today.
Naniwa MS's approach was definitely one\nto remember and worthy of study.
The score was one to zip,\nbut Naniwa MS had it in the bag.
They hadn't been doing too hot during the\ntournament, but they finally pulled through\nthis time.
And the point they scored started with that crazy\nlong pass by Nakanishi. That thing got some\nserious air.
It was controlled really well, too. He made it\nreal easy for the receiver, letting him play it\nexactly how he wanted.
And then he made sure the defense blocked any\nand all openings by yelling out calls.
<avatar_name>, we at Otomo play the Otomo way, but\nplaymaking like Nakanishi did today is good stuff.
I know you're not a goalie, but you should study\nthe way Naniwa MS played today.\nIt's bound to come in handy in the future.
It was one to nil, but from start to finish,\nNaniwa MS owned that field.\nThey were going to win from the first whistle.
Nakanishi had been sort of struggling throughout\nthe tournament, but he was back to his usual self\nfor today's game.
And the point they scored started with his\namazing long pass. He made that ball soar!
It was controlled so well, too. It was set up\nperfectly for the player down the field.
And his calls to the defense were excellent.\nHe effectively predicted the opponents' moves\nand had the defense close off any openings.
<avatar_name>, you hear a lot about playmaking,\nbut there's a lot of ways to do that.
I'm sure it'll pay off someday if you learn\nthe way Nakanishi played today.
They won one to nothing, but Naniwa MS had it\nin the bag. They were never in a pinch.
This tournament had been giving Nakanishi a tough\ntime, but he did great in that match today.\nThat felt like the real Nakanishi.
Their point came from his long pass. That was\nan impressive pass. It flew as well as mine.
And he controlled it really well. Getting a pass\nlike that, you can easily turn that into a play.
And his defensive calls were something else.\nHe moved around the defense to close down openings\nwith no hesitation.
You can't make calls like that if you can't\npredict your opponents' attacks.
<avatar_name>, that's a playstyle that uses\neveryone in the team, not unlike ours at Hanawa.
You should probably learn it.\nI'm sure it'd come in handy someday.

You're that <avatar_name> from Hirado MS,\nain'tcha?








I was mad impressed with ya pullin' off plays\nthat big with that rough-and-tumble team,\nand as a first-year to boot.
I'd love to face ya, but Hirado MS schooled us\ngood, so it ain't happenin'. Sucks.


































Then I lost to Soda from Azumaichi again after the\nOsaka Regionals!
With Furano MS, they were super unified around\nMatsuyama, and that persistence won 'em the game.
Against Musashi MS, Misugi saw through every last\none of my plays, and their three forwards threw us\nfor a loop and a half.























Here we go, Nakanishi!
Oh, yeah? Bring it on, Jito!
Argh, to think I could get overpowered like that!\nIncredible!
Thanks for today, Jito. I owe ya one.
Not at all. Ain't nothin' I like better than\nfacin' off against someone who's known for his\nstrength.
What gets me is that you two know each other.\nMan, <avatar_name>, it's like you know everyone.
Ya guys did me in today, but I'll stop your\nPower Shot next time, you'll see!
Ha! I'll be waitin'!
Hey, Jito! Coach wants to see you!
Okay, be there in a sec!
See ya on the field next time, Nakanishi.





I gotta say, the force Jito puts into his kicks...\nI'm not quite that strong yet.







The score was one to nil but the match didn't feel\nlike that whatsoever.
Yeah. Naniwa MS had it in the bag.
I'd heard Nakanishi was kind of in a funk during\nthe tournament, but I reckon today he's at his\nfinest.
And the point they scored started with his\namazing long kick.\nHe made that ball soar the way you do, Jito!
It wasn't just far, either. His control was\nperfect. With that precision, the receivin' player\ncan easily turn that pass into a play.
His callouts to defense were spot on, too.\nThe opponent's shots are super easy to read when\nyou can route the attack like that.
Sano, <avatar_name>, tactics are a major part\nof a match.
Bein' able to use different setups gives ya way\nmore of an advantage than fallin' into a pattern.
Commit the way Naniwa MS played today to memory,\nya hear?
You got it!
Hey! Yeah, you!
Sorry, mind if I ask for directions?
I was gonna meet up with someone, but I was\nchecking out the training grounds around here,\nand now I'm not sure where I'm supposed to be.
I'm not sure I can help.
Why not try checking on your phone?
Oh, if I could just check on your phone that'd\nwork. Mine died.
Totally my fault for not checking my charge.
I would, but my phone died. Of course, I forget to\ncheck how much battery I have when I need it the\nmost.
I know we don't really know each other,\nbut please?
Thanks! I owe you one!
Okay, so we're here... Then turn at this store...\nGo down that street, then there...
Got it! Thanks so much.\nDidn't know what I was gonna do.
You must really like soccer. I noticed your\njersey's a replica of the Japan one, right?
What? It's a real Japan Representative jersey?!\nSo, you're one of their players?!
...<avatar_name>, is it?
Well, thank you. I'll be sure to remember you.
Oh yeah, I should introduce myself, too.
I'm Xiao Junguang, from China. Nice to meet you.
But man this island rules.\nNo matter where you go, there's soccer everywhere.
To tell the truth, I play soccer, too.\nI've been going around checking out other\ncountries' practices.
Anyway, I gotta get going.
I'll check out a Japan game soon.\nGotta see how the fellow Asians are doing!
Later!
Hey there, <avatar_name>. I was watching you\nduring your match the other day.
You're pretty good. You didn't back down,\neven against some of the world's best.
Seeing as how you've got moves like that, I have\na favor to ask you. If it's alright with you.
Sorry to bug you right after practice,\nbut I wanted to kick the ball around a bit.\nYou got time?
It's been pretty nice getting to see all the\nsoccer I want since coming to this island,\nbut just watching just doesn't cut it.
You know how when you watch fun matches or skilled\nplayers practicing and you just wanna play so bad?
You could really help me shake the rust off.\nAll this spectating makes me wonder if I've lost\na step.
Sure you can keep up?
Should we get some others?
Hey, you have yet to see what I can do.
You will, soon enough.\nI'm pretty sure I'm better than you think.
Oh, no thanks. I just wanna play with you.
Now, let's hit the pitch!
Okay, ready when you're ready.\nCome at me whenever!
What happened? Is that all you can do?\nI haven't been practicing lately,\nbut I could still stop you pretty easily.
Do I sense frustration?\nWell, take it out through the game!
Come on, was the match the other day just a fluke?\nYou're practically feeding me the ball.\nShow me what you can really do!
There! It's mine!
(Ngh. How could I mess up the timing?!)
Hmm?
(Wh-What?! My leg's tingling from the shock\nof the shot!)
(This guy, could he...)
Sorry about that. Are you hurt?
Why don't we move on from one-on-one practice.\nLet's try shooting.\nI'll teach you the trick to long shots.
I'm pretty good at those, if I do say so myself.
Please do!
Gimme a second. My leg's still numb.
Oh, uh, okay. You're certainly enthusiastic.
But you know, I can't hate on that thirst\nfor knowledge.
Oh, sure. Go ahead.
(I knew it. You're feeling it, too!)
(That shock to the leg earlier... Maybe this guy's\ngot something cool to show me yet.)
(We'll see what you're really made of!)
Okay, well, let's get some water and then\nwe'll start!
Nicely done. I'm surprised you picked it up so\nfast!
(If he's got the legs to do my shot, and he can\nlearn to do it, then maybe it's almost time.)
Alright! Let's try going one-on-one again!
You've gotten better! Still can't dribble past me,\nthough!
(Come on, do it!)
If I can't dribble through...
Under those long legs it is!
(Here it comes! I've been waiting for this!)
(I won't miss this time!)
(Th-This is amazing! This dragon is ready to\nroar!)
(So, <avatar_name>, you were hiding this power all\nalong!)
Looks like I won this one, <avatar_name>.
What... What was that just now?!
Is this why you taught me that shot?
My ultimate move, the Superspeed Kickback\nCannon. I bounce back the opponent's shot while\nadding my power to it.
You guessed it.
That was my ultimate move, the Superspeed Kickback\nCannon. I bounce back the opponent's shot,\nwhile adding my power to it.
I used your heightened power while pinning down\njust how much of it you have. I wanted to see how\npowerful I could make the move.
Anyway, you learned a powerful shot,\nand I did what I wanted to do. It's a win-win!
Even though I play soccer, I'm kind of bad at\nplaying in a group, to be honest. Let's put it\nthis way: teamwork is not my forte.
I make up for it with the ability to bounce back\nother players' shots.
When I utilize an opponent's power and kick back\ntheir shot, a dragon takes shape in its wake.
And the stronger the opponent's shot,\nthe more stunning it is.
More than anything else, I play soccer so I can\nsee that art in the air.
So, I'm always on the lookout for skilled players\nwith powerful shots.
And there was no shortage of those in this\ntournament.
Schneider's High Fire Shot, Carlos's Sagittarius\nShot, Hyuga's Neo Tiger Shot,
Schneider's Fire Shot, Carlos and Alberto's Double\nForce Shot, Hyuga's Neo Tiger Shot,
Schneider's Fire Shot, Carlos's Sagittarius Shot,\nHyuga's Neo Tiger Shot,
Kluivoort's High Stinger, Napoleon's Cannon Shot,\nBlake's Blake Shot,
...and Tsubasa Ozora's Drive Shot.
Kluivoort's High Stinger, Pierre's Slider Shot,\nNapoleon's Cannon Shot,
...and Tsubasa Ozora's Neo Drive Shot.
It's a plethora of amazing shots. I can only\nimagine what my dragon might look like when\nI return those shots...
It's driving me nuts thinking about it.
Whoops, I almost forgot about you, <avatar_name>.
Make no mistake, your abilities give any of those\nplayers a run for their money.
Naw, my shot's not that great.
Heh, so you see my potential.
It's true they've got you beat in terms of power,\nspeed, and spin.
That said, the dragon the Superspeed Kickback\nCannon produced earlier was something to behold.
You've got some shine in you, I can tell.
You've got confidence in spades, but your current\nskills aren't quite at their level.
That said, if the Superspeed Kickback Cannon's\ndragon just now was any indication, you're going\nplaces.
I'm certain you can show me a dragon more\nbeautiful than any I've ever seen.
A shame I couldn't join the tournament.\nI hadn't had this much excitement in a while.\nYou can't get that just from watching.
I'm really grateful to my grandpa for bringing me\nto America.\nI'll have to make it up to him somehow.
You know this, but I'm saying it anyway,\n<avatar_name>. Keep practicing. Don't ever stop.
I want you to show me the ultimate dragon someday!
Hmm? You look like you've got something to say.
I'll make the ultimate dragon!
Teach me the Superspeed Kickback Cannon!
I thought you might say that! So, you're gonna\nlearn the Superspeed Kickback Cannon?
Oh? You wanna see the dragon, too?
Sorry, buddy. No can do.
If there's one thing I can say, it's that there's\na couple things you gotta take into account to\npull it off.
Figure it out yourself and practice. You might\nbe able to do it if you've got what it takes.
See you! Maybe fate will bring us together again!
Oh, come on! That defender's barely marking\nat all!
He's not sticking to the opponent, but more\nimportantly, he's letting him out of his sight\nway too much.
Aces are highly skilled. They put a little space\nbetween you like that, then one missed glance\nand they've passed right by you.
You gotta be watching them at all times.\nYou can't let them more than one step away\nfrom your field of vision.
You must have some pretty big steps.
You've got a lot to say about marking.
I suppose. I don't think anyone can dash right\ninto their mark's business faster than me.
I mean, in a sense, marking aces is one of my\nfavorite things to do.
Not to mention, my technique is a bit more nuanced\nthan average, and...uh, never mind.
Basically, I do it all to use the\nSuperspeed Kickback Cannon.
Remember this, <avatar_name>. Don't lose sight of\nyour mark, and stay one step from him at all\ntimes.
You do that and you'll avoid mistakes,\nlike the one that defender made.
Also, if your technique's on par with mine,\nyou'll enjoy yourself in other ways, too.
Oh, don't mind me. That doesn't much apply\nto you yet.
See, jumping in the instant the opponent shoots\nis an essential skill for pulling off a\nSuperspeed Kickback Cannon.
I bet you're dying to try it for yourself.\nDragons floating through your mind already?
In that case, next game you play, find a target\nand give it a shot.
Take it seriously. Get your head out of the\nclouds!
Hey, <avatar_name>. Props for training this late,\nbut you should know better than to lose focus\nlike that.
I know it's not an actual game, but you need to\nget the proper mental image when you train.
Otherwise, how could you react to surprise attacks\nlike that one, right?
Real matches don't have surprises\nlike that.
Tell me about these surprise attacks,\nactually.
Are you serious? Matches are chock full of\nunexpected attacks like those.
Tackles like that are made to exploit openings\nlike the one you left earlier.
So, you wanna know how to do it? Knowing how the\ndefense thinks and what techniques they use should\nmake it easier to plan around them.
Oh? Alright, then.
You're thinking if you know how to spring surprise\nattacks, you can come up with plans against them?\nThat's a good idea.
Sure. I'll show you.
Listen up. This tackle's all about a quick dash on\nan unsuspecting opponent, and how you make that\ndash work with a slide.
You put those together, and the moment your\nopponent gives you an in, the ball is yours.
It's easy enough to explain,\nbut it's quicker just to try it.
See? It's not that easy to react to,\neven if you know it's coming.
Okay, this time I'll dribble and you tackle.
Hmm, you're not putting your whole heart into it.\nYou gotta slam into it like you don't care if they\ngo flying.
Well, well, that's more like it.\nNow, remember that feeling.
All that's left is trying it in a match.\nYou'll see what a fatal flaw it is to give your\nopponent an opening, even for an instant.
Well then, good luck training!
What are you up to?
Are you honestly studying right now?!
Wha...?
Oh, hey, <avatar_name>.
Grandpa gave me a bit of a talking to.\nSaid just because we came to America doesn't\nmean I should slack off on my studies.
Wha...?
Oh, it's you, <avatar_name>.
And what do you mean "honestly"? I still go to\nschool, you know. I study...
Also, my grandpa told me not to slack off on\nmy studies just because we came to America.
Speaking of studies, I was going over world\nhistory. It's pretty cool learning the history\nof the different countries playing here.
They've all got great people, and they have one\nthing in common. They had a sense for where the\ntimes were headed.
History's got tons of people who had plenty of\npower, but were washed away with the zeitgeist.
<avatar_name>, you don't strike me as someone\nwho loves studying.
Well, let's put it in terms of soccer.\nThe same thing applies, you know.
Just like history, the situation in soccer\nchanges in a flash. One second you're attacking,\nthen you're defending.
And sometimes people who are really skilled can't\nread the flow of a match well and don't get to do\nmuch.
Does that make sense? If you wanna be the kind of\nplayer that affects a match, you have to be aware\nof its flow.
For example, think of the flow around the score.\nYou'll be able to change matches if you can figure\nout the plays the team has to make in the moment.
The best players are probably the ones who can\nrise above the hectic changes in a match.
Say, Katagiri, what do you think of how\n<avatar_name>'s been playing lately?
You can tell he's gotten better. It looks as\nthough he's got a better grasp of where the match\nis going, and when to attack or defend.
You thought so too, huh?
It always amazes me how he manages to get better\nout of the blue.
It would really be something to see him become\na hero and transform Japanese soccer.
He does always seem to be hunting for the next\nopportunity. That may be his future.
Huh. I guess he must've gotten something\nout of the conversation we once had.
What an interesting guy. To think he'd change up\nhis style so much just from one conversation.
Well, he won't leave me in the dust. Second I get\nback home, I'm training harder than ever!
Hope we get to play each other someday!
Heads up, Tsubasa!
Nice pass, Misaki!
Okay, I can make it from here! Drive Shot!
Whoa, are you okay, <avatar_name>?!
(<avatar_name>'s timing for blocks has been\nso strange lately.)
(Could he be...)
All yours, Hyuga!
Leave it to me!
Here I go. Tiger Shot!
<avatar_name>, you okay?!\nDon't go getting hurt during practice!
(Lately <avatar_name>'s been jumping\nin at the weirdest times.)
(No way. Is he...)
Hyuga, can I talk to you for a second?
Just as I thought. The way <avatar_name>'s been\nplaying... You sensed it, too, didn't you?
Yeah. If I didn't know any better I'd say he's\ntrying to bounce our shots back.
It's like when our shots clashed during the\nRegional finals.
Except <avatar_name>'s trying to do it at nearly\npoint-blank range.
Getting the timing wrong on that risks injuring\nnot only the person taking the shot,\nbut <avatar_name>, too.
For certain.
I want you to be careful and keep an eye on him.\nI'm thinking I'll talk to him if it becomes a bit\nmuch.
Sounds good. If it reaches that point,\nI'll tell him off, too.
(...The way he's going at it isn't safe.)
Hey, <avatar_name>. I checked out your last match\nand afternoon practice.
It looks like you figured out the necessary\ncomponents to pull off a Superspeed Kickback\nCannon.
The agility to lunge right into your opponent's\nspace, a knack for matching the timing of their\nleg swing speed,
and lower body strength powerful enough\nto overturn the force of their shot.
However, you still don't know how to make\nthe parts work together.
Which is why no matter how much you practice,\nyou're never going to master the move.
Teach me how to make them work, then!
I... I'm not giving up!
You don't beat around the bush, huh?
I suppose that's why I'm here anyway.
You're a stubborn one.
(Although...\nI can't help but to see myself in you.)
...
...Oh, alright. I'll show you how it's done.
You might be able to pick it up since you're\nso set on it.
Okay, listen up.
During practice today you were getting right\nin Tsubasa and Hyuga's faces.\nNow, you've got the right idea.
The best timing for the Superspeed Kickback Cannon\nis the very moment after the opponent shoots.
Granted, that's not the case against headers,\nof course.
But getting back to the point, like I said,\nin order to execute the move, you have to lunge\nat the opponent immediately after they shoot.
However, the timing you hit it back with bears\na sizable risk.
You mess up any one part of the timing, and you\nand your going bang shins with the other guy,\nand that is not pretty.
Judging from your performance today,\nI can guarantee you're gonna crack some bones.
I won't be able to play some of the opponents\nI've been eyeing if you wreck them beforehand.
And I'd hate to go on knowing you might be out\nthere hurting your teammates in matches,\nlet alone during practice.
So, for the sake of the fun I very much intend\nto have in the future, let me help you out.
Now, let's get right to it!
Time for the boom!
No, no, no! You're freaking yourself out and\nswinging too late! That was just the ball hitting\nyour leg!
Let's go again! Here we go!
Too slow! The farther you are from the opponent's\nleg, the harder it is to bounce the shot back\naccurately!
Get as close to your opponent as you can, then\nin one short burst, jump right in their face!\nDon't forget, it's all or nothing!
Not quite. You'll barely make out the\ndragon's tail with a shot like that!
You lack concentration! You don't get that many\nchances to use this during a match, you know!
You have to be determined to pour all of the\nattention needed into nailing that one shot\nduring the game!
Practice won't mean a thing if it's halfhearted.\nLet's do one last shot.
I want you to give it everything you've got!
Here it comes!
I'm gonna see that dragon!
It's all on the table!
Wha...?!
Wha...?!
Hyuga!
Yep, I got this!
Watch out! <avatar_name>!
Bwuh?!
Wh-What the heck?!
What... just happened?!
Did you just perfectly bounce my shot back?!
That was one heck of a surprise back there,\n<avatar_name>.
I gotta say, even though you caught me unawares,\nthat was an incredibly powerful shot to score on\nme from outside the box.
I'll say. That shot was amazing!
I gathered that you'd been trying to do that move\nrecently, and actually, I almost told you to cut\nit out since it's so dangerous.
But after seeing that, I changed my mind.
Well, you may've bounced my shot back this time,\nbut next time I'll make it so strong you won't\neven be able to try!
And I would've definitely caught it if I'd been on\nmy toes, so bring it on anytime!
In any case, that's an amazing move.\nI'm gonna have to try it out one day.
(What a magnificent dragon. It seems you've\nmastered the Superspeed Kickback Cannon.)
(To think there would be someone else in the world\ncapable of using my technique.)
(Just wait. One day I'll be out on the world\nstage, bouncing back the best players' shots.)
(I'll unveil a world of dragons!)
Oh, hey there, <avatar_name>.\nDidn't know you were here, too.
You must really love soccer, though, to be coming\nto see matches in your free time.
Just seeing what I can learn.
If I've got soccer, I'm happy.
I admire how studious you are.
I see.
It gets harder to just enjoy it once you've made\nit your job, like I have.
Still, I know how you feel.\nThat's a feeling you never wanna forget.
This match is between Brazilian and American\nclub teams in the Junior Youth category.
They came to the island being some of the\ncountries Mr. Cardinal invited for his event\npromoting soccer.
Though not at the level of rep matches, naturally,\nthey're all playing really hard.\nBut in a stadium this nice, who wouldn't?
Hmm, who's that one player?
Ahh, no wonder. It's one of the Brazilian players.\nHe's a bit rough around the edges,\nbut you can tell he has a knack for this.
Seeing play like this makes you realize Japanese\nsoccer has to up the ante.
Oops, look at the time. Hate to go,\nbut I've got somewhere to be. See you around.
Who are you? You weren't one of the kids\non the other team.
I want you to teach me your technique.
You've awesome dribbling and shooting!
Huh? You wanna learn my technique?
...Sorry, but I don't have the time for that.
Well, I mean, that was pretty standard for me.
Wait, you want me to show you how I played\nearlier, don't you?
Sorry, but I just don't have that kinda time right\nnow.
This fancy stadium, the training grounds we'll be\nusing later, the brand-spanking new balls and\ncleats...
I don't get to use stuff like this normally, so I\nhave to practice my butt off while I'm in America.
Then let's practice together!
You get better if you have someone\nto play off of!
How many times will you make me say it?! I don't\nhave time to waste on anyone else right now!
I gotta worry about my game right now.\nI don't have time to mess with others!
By the way, I see that jersey.\nYou're one of the Japanese reps, aren't you?
You rich kids have no idea how hard it is for me!
If you get what I'm saying then go away already!\nI'm wasting my precious time talking to you!
(What was the deal with that guy, anyway?)
...
(Whatever, I have more important things to do.\nPractice! I've no time to waste!)
Alright, <avatar_name>. We're going on ahead.
Don't work yourself to the bone, eh?
Hey. I saw you practice today.
You're not half bad.\nMakes sense you were chosen as a rep.
Wait, uh, do you remember me?
You're that Brazil club player!
I do, but I didn't catch your name.
Yep, I'm in the Brazilian club team.
Oh yeah, I hadn't told you my name.
Oh, sorry about that. Come to think of it,\nI never did tell you my name back then.
I'm Pepe. Nice to meet you.
You're <avatar_name>, right?
I caught one of Japan's games the other day.\nYou had some pretty slick moves,\nso I definitely remember you.
And, um... I'm really sorry about the other day.\nI was a bit mean.
I had a bit of a change of heart since then,\nso I really wanted to meet up with you again.
I've got some things going on in my life,\nand I probably have to go pro next year.
But recently I felt like I wasn't getting any\nbetter and it was making me kinda desperate.
It was around then that I remembered what you told\nme.
You said to practice together, right?
When I stopped to really think about it,\nit hit me how obvious it is that you improve more\nwhen you practice with others.
So, I went all over the place talking to different\nplayers and practicing with them.
You said you get better if you have someone\nto play off of, right?
When I chilled out and really thought about it, I\nrealized you were right. I got better by learning\nfrom pros and from the other kids in the club.
So, I went around watching other teams looking for\nplaystyles that fit me and studying them closely.
Since then, recently I feel like I got over\nmy wall!
In order to become a pro, I tried recklessly\nto outdo everyone around me all by myself.
But what I ended up doing was picking up this\nweird doesn't-care attitude, and actually cutting\nback on my potential.
You didn't care that I was some nobody. You still\ntalked to me. I think that's pretty amazing.
It's so simple: If it's good, it's good. If you\nwanna integrate it, do it. But I have a hard time\nbeing that honest with myself.
So, thanks. I owe you for expanding my horizons\na bit!
I know this isn't much, but let's practice\ntogether today. You were still gonna practice\nsome more, weren't you?
Of course, I have every intention of baiting\nyour moves, so you should do the same to me.
And I won't be stingy about it,\nso I hope you aren't either!
Let's hop on it, then! Clock's a' tickin'!
Man, you're next level!
I know I told you to bite my moves, but I didn't\nthink you could do it that easily!
And I thought I had improved since coming here.\nMeanwhile, you've been zooming ahead.
Dang it, I can't get left behind! I gotta get\nbetter than everyone and go pro, no matter what\nit takes!
That's it, <avatar_name>.\nWe're gonna train like crazy today!
Why are you so hung up on going pro?
You don't have to go pro\nif you love soccer.
I, Um... I have my reasons.
I wish I could say the same.
I'm from a small country town called Campo Grande.\nWe don't really have a lot of means...\nalmost any really.
It's actually pretty tough out there.\nI can't play soccer just because I like it.
But if I went pro, that's a whole 'nother story.
I'd be able to give my mom and my siblings\na better life AND play my favorite sport.
I mean, going pro's a dream of mine,\nbut I'm also doing it for my family.
Anyone would get pretty desperate,\ndon't you think?
I've also got my heart set on the team\nI wanna take the entrance tryouts for.
Sao Paulo. It's one of, if not the top team in\nBrazil. I'm thinking of getting into it next year.
It's been my dream team since I was little.\nBut more importantly, I could make life easier\nfor my family being a pro on a major team.
Actually, Sao Paulo was called to an event\nwe were in, and I got to see them practice.
All the players were incredible.\nThat's first rate training for you.\nI mean, the coach is an ex-Brazil rep!
After that, I felt I wanted to play for them\neven more.
And I know because it's a top-tier team the\ncompetition would be fierce inside and out.
But I'll get in there, come out on top,\nand become a pro! You'll see!
...I just realized I haven't shut up for a hot\nminute. How about you?
I imagine you're all about winning the tournament\nright now, but what about the future?\nWhat do you have in mind?
I wanna make my school the best.
I wanna go pro in Japan.
I wanna go pro in Europe.
I wanna go pro in Brazil.
School, huh? That's pretty important.
I want to have my siblings go to a proper school\nwith good facilities.\nYet another reason to keep working hard.
Sorry, there I go again.\nThat's a good goal, though.\nUse those skills of yours and make it happen!
A national league, eh?\nMakes sense to aim for that.
Speaking of the Japanese league,\nI heard a lot of Brazilian players go there.
Hey, maybe one day I'll get an offer from the\nJapanese club and we end up playing together!
Wow, that's a pretty lofty goal right there.
They've got teams and players famous around the\nglobe. I imagine it's also really tough with how\nhigh the level of play is.
But hey, if you're gonna dream, dream big, right?\nI wanna get to the point where I get a huge offer\nfor a transfer like that myself.
And then we'd be rivals!
WHAT?! PRO?! IN BRAZIL?!
If you think you can do that easily,\nyou've got another thing coming!
Uh, sorry for yelling.\nI don't mean to dash your dreams or anything.
But believe you me, if we wind up competing on\nthe same team, you better not expect any special\ntreatment!
Oh jeez, maybe we're talking too much.
Discussing our dreams is all well and good, but\nwe're not gonna get any better if we don't\npractice. Come on, let's do it while we can!
For now, you focus on winning this tournament,\nand I'll focus on getting into Sao Paulo.
Let's work hard and not waste a second!
What? You want me to teach you\nSouth American-style dribbling?
I guess I don't mind teaching you.
But wait, wasn't there someone in the Japanese\nteam who could do it? Why not learn it from him?
I'd rather learn it from the source.
It's same style but different.
Ah, okay.
Well, if you're gonna talk me up that much then\nI guess I'm gonna have to!
Huh.
I suppose I have developed my own style.
And if you're gonna talk it up like that,\nI can't go letting you down, now can I?!
Let's get on it, then!\nCan't use these grounds forever!
First up, a little hands-on practice.\nHere it goes!
...ball mastery kinda like this.
The important thing about this dribble is getting\npast an opponent into a position that makes it\neasy to shoot from.
See, I'm a forward, so if I can't turn it into a\nshot, what good is it, right?
Okay. Your turn. See if you can do it!
Let's see what you got!
Hmm, your ball mastery's still really stiff.
You gotta get looser kinda like...\nAck, how can I explain it?
I developed it off of how it felt and how\nI imagined it. Not really through words.
Alright! I say we just take turns dribbling!
Try to figure it out by doing what I do!\nYou've got this!
No, that's not it! Your ankle's still stiff as a\nrobot! Ball mastery in South American style's all\nabout finesse!
Okay, take another look at how I do it!
Yes! You're on the right track now!\nReally watch the tail end of the dribble!
You've almost got it! Keep trying!
Oh?! That was a good one right there!
Dude, you've got a real knack for this if you can\npick it up that way!
Next, I want you to do it when you practice with\nyour team. Give your teammates a little surprise!
Also, I'd appreciate it if you used it during\na match, if you can.
Knowing the technique I developed works on the\nworld stage would be a huge confidence boost.\nYou'd do that for me, right <avatar_name>?!
Okay, I'll lift it, so go for a direct shot!
Go!
Hmm, this has been on my mind for a bit, but your\nheaders are kinda lacking in the power department.
I wanna see you really slam the ball into the\ngoal.
Are headers your thing?
I can get by without resorting\nto my head.
Oh, absolutely!
You can't be serious.
When points are on the line, you gotta think\nabout getting goals in every way, shape or form.\nYou can't afford to be picky.
Alright! I'll show you how it's done.\nSet me up in front of the goal.
That's it, <avatar_name>! Now hit me!
Okay! Watch this!
Well? How's that for a header?
If you ask me, the trick is to hit the ball\nlike stupid hard.
Opponents get really frantic in front of the goal\ntrying not to let you score, so you have to exceed\nthat energy to win.
You with me? If nothing else, don't be afraid\nof the ball. Jump into it with all your might!
Okay, you're up! Lose the hesitation and just do\nit! I assure you it'll come in handy!
Okay, <avatar_name>. Do it!
Łoł! Dude... Since when are your headers\nso souped up?!
(I can't believe it. That was as sharp as...\nNo, even sharper than my Diving Header.)
(I had absolute confidence in my headers,\nbut it looks like I just got myself a rival.\nGotta up my game!)
(That guy was barely trying and yet he managed\nto make the move all his own.)
(But wow, that really was a good header.\nI'll have to keep polishing mine.)
Alright, time to get this show on the road!
Phew. Let's take a bit of a break. I mean,\nI'm good, but you've got a match coming up.
Speaking of which, I was watching you play\nrecently. You really do have some nice technique.
But...I noticed something you're lacking.
It's true you're skilled, but you can be a little\nindifferent.
What jumped out at me in particular was the way\nyou played after messing up. I couldn't sense an\nurgency to make up for those mistakes.
Wait. Don't tell me you feel like you don't have\nto impress the coach just 'cause you're a starter\namong the reps!
If that's the case, you couldn't be more wrong.
The battle to be a starter is real.\nIt doesn't matter that you're in the same team,\neveryone's gunning to be one.
If you give up on consistently standing out,\nyou'll lose the spot before you know it.
Obviously, all players make mistakes.\nThere's nothing you can do about that.
But you can't mess up and think it's just meant\nto happen.
You mess up? You work extra hard to make up for\nit!
You've got technique, a good sense for soccer,\nand a real desire to work on your game.\nI've gotta give you that.
But that's exactly why you have to show\nit off during matches!\nDon't let anybody doubt how bad you wanna win!
...Hmm.
Hey, <avatar_name>, come here for a second.
You were moving really well out there today.\nI noticed you worked really hard to make up for\nthat miss.
I take it you're confident in your technique.\nBut maybe because of that, when you messed up,\nyou kind of used to let it drag you down.
Every player makes mistakes. There's no two ways\nabout that.\nWhat matters is what you do afterwards.
And I couldn't ask for more than the attitude you\nhad today. I hope you don't forget it. Keep it up.
Alright boys, that's it for practice today!\nGo home and rest up!
Thanks, Captain!
Oh? Are you guys wrapping up?
Yeah, just finished.
You're too late!
What's the reason you're showing up now?
Hey, come on. We weren't trying to be late.
We just got back from an open school at the\nhigh school we're trying to get into.
Yep, we were at an open school deal for a\nhigh school we're hoping to get into.\nWe were there since this morning.
Welcome back. How was it?
Checking out the school was pretty cool.\nThey recently revamped a bunch of the facilities,\nso everything felt shiny and new.
I'd seen photos on their site, but seeing the\nplace in person definitely leaves a clearer\nimpression. Got a good feel for it, I think.
Ya could say something similar 'bout soccer.
Ha! Yeah, for sure.
Aren't you guys going to Kunimi Institute?
Not sure just yet. You know, there's a lot of\nthings we're thinking about in terms of the\nfuture.
Going from elementary to middle school isn't that\ndifferent, but it's a whole new world stepping\ninto high school.
Right... Everybody graduating will probably end up\nat a bunch of different schools.
Well, what can ya do?\nEverybody has to make their own way.
But how come you're in jerseys? You went to\nthe open school in school uniforms, right?
Oh, these?
We knew we'd miss team practice,\nso we figured we'd get some training in after.\nWe changed and hurried over as fast as we could!
You're gonna practice NOW?!
Yeah. We've been on a roll.\nCan't let that go to waste!
I want in on this practice!
I'm with you every step of the way!
Let me tag along. The more the merrier, right?\nPractice will be better if we do it together!
Sounds good, <avatar_name>.
I mean, the Junior Hero League is the last time\nwe'll be able to play as a team!\nCan't waste the opportunity!
I wanna give it all I've got!
Hatakeyama, Morisue, count us in, too!
And how would it make your upperclassmen look\nif we turned in after you guys said all that?
Am I right?!
Tak!
You guys are great...
Y'all are a bunch o' nuts, and I love it!
That's what makes us special.
Well, you asked for it! Hatakeyama, Morisue!\nGet them legs movin'!
The menu is drills, drills, and more drills\ntil the sun sets!
Tak!







Haaah!
Now!
There!
I see you!
Comin'!
Here it goes!
Tak!























Captain!
Don't let me down!
Make it happen!
Go!
I won't miss!
We can do this!
You and me!
Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Wakabayashi!
Misaki!
Matsuyama!
Misugi!

Victorino!
Senghor!
Diallo!
Blake!
Azwan!
What'd you expect?!
There's no way I can lose.
You'll never beat me.
How disappointing. You came so close.
Nothing is impossible for me.
I win.
I'll lead us to victory!
Alright, one more push!
Don't doubt the outcome, if you got me.
Don't worry! No one's unbeatable!
Calm down! We'll get the lead back!
We can't give up any more points!
In tough times, count on me!
Very good!
Tremendous!
More of that!
This is bad...
What now...?!
Stop 'em!
I like that!
Alright.
That's right! I got this!
Stampede!
Here!
This way!
I'll handle it!
Pass!
Time to take control.
Finish this! Now!
Take back the rhythm!
My eyes see clearly!
I see through everything!
I can read you like a book!
Now!
This is your weakness!
We're going with this play!
Time to check my answers.
Are you getting it now?
Heh... I'm in the mood now!
Witness the Rabona Illusion!
Do you think you can stop me?!
I'll show you the supreme technique!
Hmph. You've no self-awareness.
Useless!
Now go!
You don't have permission to fail!
Here I come.
Now to just sneak in here...
Now.
You're not gettin' by me, buddy.
Let me show you your flaws.
Witness my power!
This is our strength!
See that? That's our strength!
I win, Tsubasa!
Ugh... Nice one, Tsubasa!
You've been weighed and measured, Hyuga.
A real tiger! I couldn't have imagined!
This isn't an art contest, Misaki.
Challenging to convert art into data...
This is the power of never giving up!
So you chip away at them... Rational.
I think I enjoy polishing talent...
It's amazing how you dive in!
Not giving you an inch, Takeshi!
You might be top notch, too, Takeshi.
You dare call yourself an emperor!
I need to respect an emperor's strength.
Don't take that attitude with me, Heine!
That was my mistake, not your talent.
Beauty and victory are separate, Pierre!
Is this your elegance of soccer?
You're too slow, Napoleon.
You're surprisingly skilled, Napoleon.
That won't work, Jean.
Your pride... It gives you strength!
You're a total waste of time, Kluivoort.
Much sharper than expected, Kluivoort!
So that's the limit of your imagination!
So this is a fantasista!
A machine could never beat me!
Carlos... the Ace of the future.
You're not half bad, Alberto.
Your pride in Brazil gives you strength!
If you're a prodigy, then so am I!
You have undeniable talent, Diaz.
Still leaving openings, Victorino!
Ugh, I underestimated you!
You've got a ways to go, Senghor!
I know quality when I see it!
Haha! Brute force is pointless!
Never knew you were this strong, Blake!
I'll bring out your best!
You'll never lose with me on your side!
Trust me, and I'll lead us to victory!
Give me a hand here, guys!







Tak!
Ooh!
Slick!
There we go!
Comin' in hot!
Engines to full!
Get in there!























Captain!
Now it's up to you!
Trusting you with this!
Heading your way!
Works every time!
I did it, didn't I?!
Never fails!
Makes me feel like dancin'!
Knew it all along!
In she goes!
What did you think?
We tied it!
Prepare to get buried!
Loss is an impossibility to my mind!

And the ball flies ahead with fresh fury!
A diving header for the ages!
The Skylab... No! There's another player!
And he's up! A midair header straight to... Łoł! They snuck a shot in!
Is this how they do it in South America?!
A graceful dodger for sure!
A high speed collision like trains meeting on a track!
His spring transitions to a fearsome slide!
Fantastic! He's facing the opponent's shot with his own!
Ah! And the shot fires back!
Łoł! Nakanishi's stopped the ball with those broad shoulders!
Nakanishi stops the ball with his belly! An unrivaled wall!
He's closing in on his prey! Goal!
Without a moment's hesitation he's got another one!
G-Goal! What a terrifying counter-shot!
I-I can't believe what I'm seeing! This defies...
The ferocity of that shot could not be denied! Goal!
What a shot! Such heart and drive!
You can't help but feel the tenacity in that shot!
Such a tricky header! But it pays off!
A designer shot of highest caliber! What a sight!
They're the three musketeers! Beautiful acrobatics!
Łoł! And he catches it! He made that look easy!
Nakanishi makes a solid catch!
He plucked it from there like it was being handed to him!
An easy save!
Nakanishi shows us how it's done!
Wow, what a clean catch!
What a jump! What an impressive catch!
And Nakanishi makes an enormous sideways leap!
That shot was no match for such raw agility!
He's got the ball safe in his hands!
Nakanishi has the ball locked down tight!
He's got it! That's our bigshot goalie!
We're in for a heated battle here on the Hirado\nMS pitch!
Which side is the real powerhouse?\nWe will find out on Hirado MS's pitch!
It's finally here folks, the match you've all been waiting for!\nWhich of these players will clear the path to victory?!
What we're about to see is sure to delight and\nastound! That's the sort of soccer we're in for\ntoday!
The match of the future is about to happen,\nright here in the Victory Road Space!
We can only expect the unexpected! It's all new\nhere, right down to the player's expressions!
Anything could happen here! And the players know\nthat too, as they spread out across the field!
The players are taking their positions!\nTheir efforts today will demonstrate the\npotential for the future of soccer!
Now, the moment we've all been waiting for!\nWhat new sort of soccer will we see in this\ncutting-edge stadium?!
We're about to begin a match with special rules!\nWhich team will have luck on their side?
It's almost time for the kickoff! The time draws\nnear for new territory to be explored!
Here in the Victory Road Space, the players\neagerly look forward to playing an unfamiliar\nsoccer!
Both teams' players are entering a brand-new\nbattleground for a new kind of battle!
Both teams' players are burning with fighting\nspirit as they enter the arena!
New experiences await them as the players take the\nfield!
The teams are staring each other down!\nIt seems they can't wait another moment to clash!
A new liberty never before seen in soccer awaits!\nThe players seem uplifted by the possibilities!
Look at the nervousness on their faces!\nA battle the likes of which has never been\nseen before beckons!
It's hard to tell at a glance, but there's all of\nthis is truly novel! Expectations are high for the\nskill that will be on display in the stadium!
Though they have a great deal in common,\nthey each also have their own aura about them!\nIt's impossible to predict how they'll play!



What's this? They won through not only goals\nbut medal stats, too!
What a victory! In both the goals scored and\nsportsmanship, this is truly the beautiful game!
What a defeat! Their opponents overpowered them in\nboth goals and the plays themselves!
A bitter defeat! They couldn't compete in either\ngoals or medal stats!
A victory in overall results! They earned the\nmedals to win by piling up astounding plays!
A win from overall results! There were plenty of\nbrilliant plays, and they paved a path to victory!
A loss through overall results! As painful as it\nis to see, the medal rules kept them from victory.
A loss from overall results! Was it just too hard to pull off highly-rated plays?
Victory! They may have gained the lead through the\nmedal stats, but they won through their own ability!
Victory! They've snatched a win by finding the\nback of the net time and time again!
Defeat! They took advantage of the rules,\nbut couldn't quite pull it off!
Defeat! They were gaining ground with the medal\nstats, but couldn't quite seal the deal!
A tie! What a game! Neither side gave an inch!
I can't believe it! Both sides gave it everything\nthey had, and the result is a draw!








The players have started to really hustle! What amazing speed!
Look at them run! Will they press straight for the goal?!


They blew right past everyone!
The players have been downed by a hidden trap!
You can see the anticipation in their feet! We're in for some superb shooting for sure!
What a powerful sprint! All eyes are on the goal!
They're attacking from the outside! The other team can't handle it!
The attack's flying in all directions! How can they hope to counteract that?!
The attack's pushing forward! They're clearing a path as they go!
All opponents in front are downed! What an intense frontal assault!




The team seems to really be coming together!
They're gathering their strength!
What an opportunity! Three points for one savage shot!
It's three points for one goal now! The best shots will determine the outcome!


Ah! The time has come! An unavoidable down from a penalty!
They couldn't keep up the attack! They lost the ball due to a penalty!


It's in! They're toying with their opponents! They can't keep up!
Goal! What a shot! That offensive play was unstoppable!
What a goal! A well-timed assault using the might in their legs!
And they pierced the goal with an even more powerful shot!
What a beautiful shot! And this goal earns them three points!
That net has to be getting worn out! Three points!


What an opportunity! Three points for one savage shot!
It's three points for one goal now! The best shots will determine the outcome!


They've set a trap!
The trap activates! The players are down!
They've received a warning! They blew past those players!
They couldn't seal the deal! An unavoidable down!
Now then, it's time to finally begin the National\nMiddle School Soccer tournament!
Yesterday, it seems Okinawa was ravaged by a\ntyphoon, but here today the weather is just\nperfect for the opening ceremony!
The scorching August sun\nblazes down on the field
as each of the 47 elite teams chosen to represent\ntheir regions aim to take that red championship\nbanner! This'll be a fierce competition, folks!
Representing Akita: Hanawa MS\nMasao and Kazuo Tachibana
This year,\nthat banner is ours!
You got that right!
Representing Osaka: Azumaichi MS\nMakoto Soda
Hmph.
Representing Nagasaki: Hirado MS\nHiroshi Jito
I ain't worried. That's ours for the takin'.
Representing Hokkaido: Furano MS\nHikaru Matsuyama
This is the year Hokkaido's\ntaking home the banner!
Right, team?!
On it!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Right beside ya!
(I'm not handing that banner over to anyone.\nOn the last day, I'll be the one holding it,\nonce again.)
Hey, look at Toho's lineup.\nHyuga isn't there.
Huh?
(Hyuga...)
(...)
Still, we've got some awful luck with this\ntournament bracket, right?
It's like we're up against all the strongest\nteams, right up 'til the finals with Toho. If all\ngoes well, anyway.
But it's single elimination.\nSo we can't afford even one loss.
Yeah.\nThe only way to be the champs is to\ntake down every team we come up against.
If you think of it like that, it doesn't matter\nwhere they seeded us in the bracket.
Yeah, I guess...\nBut guys, aren't your hearts just pounding?
Of course!
We're third years, and this is our last\ntournament. You think I want our record stained\nwith even a single loss?
That's the spirit!
Azumaichi MS got through the Osaka Regionals\nwithout giving up a single point.
The core of their defense is Makoto Soda,\nknown in Kansai as "Ace Killer Soda."
He always marks the opposing ace and shuts\nhim down, cutting him off and\nmaking clear shots impossible.
I hear he even injured the leg of\nNaniwa MS's center forward.
This guy sounds like bad news...
In this match, Soda's definitely going after\nTsubasa, so watch out.
Yes, Coach!
Alright! Let's get off to a strong start.
Time to win another championship!
Tak! Triple victory!
Listen up.\nWhen it comes down to it,\nTsubasa Ozora is Nankatsu.
As long as we can keep him in check,\nthe rest will take care of itself.
In other words, with me here to stop him,\nwe've got this in the bag!
We're gonna take Nankatsu down\nright in front of this huge audience!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Alright, with the opening ceremony over,\nlet's move right on to the first match.
The match between Shizuoka's Nankatsu MS, the\nformer champions, and Osaka's Azumaichi MS, making\ntheir Nationals debut, is about to commence!
Looks like most of the teams from the opening\nceremony are sticking around to watch, too!
That's just how high profile Nankatsu is, now\nthat they're so near to the crowning achievement\nof becoming the champs three years in a row.
Heeey! Ishizaki!
Hmmm?
We're here to cheer you on, like we promised!
Hey, it's Urabe and the rest of his team!
You absolutely cannot lose!\nIf you don't win the championship,\nI'll never let you live it down!
Just leave it to us!
Hey, jerk wads!\nThis ain't no picnic!
What are you on about?
Bet you were all kickin' back, takin' it easy\ncuz you've been the champs the last two times.
Let's hurry up and get ready for the match.
So you're Tsubasa Ozora, huh?
...
Seeing you up close, you don't look so tough.
I'll be marking you, so you're gonna see\na whole lotta me in this game.
Tsubasa, this is the guy who stole the\ngame-winning goal from THE Nakanishi.\nSoda's the real deal.
Yes.
Alright, here we go!\nRemember, all in for the\ntriple-victory!
Idiots! You're not getting \nthat third victory!
I'll stop both Nankatsu and \nTsubasa Ozora myself!
Yeah right, like Tsubasa'd \never lose to a guy like you!
Hmph. You'll see soon enough.
Well, then now's the time!\nI won't hold back!
You won't be showing off THIS match!
He vanished!
Razor Tackle!
What?!
Agh!
And there's Soda's special technique! Not quite a foul, but it's close!
Guh, what was that tackle!
Try this on for size! Razor\nShot!
Even if it takes a foul, \nno team's ace gets by me.
And that's the first half!
It must be said,\nNankatsu is off to a great start on winning their\nthird consecutive Nationals title!
And that's the first half!
Nankatsu came today looking for a third Nationals\nvictory, but find themselves deadlocked with\nAzumaichi!
And that's the first half!
What an upset! In their Nationals debut,\nAzumaichi has already taken a lead\nover the three-time-champion hopefuls, Nankatsu.
That Soda guy's got some flash.
It's crazy he can keep up with Tsubasa,\nup and down the pitch.
Yeah, well we're still the ones in the lead.
Yeah, up against a defensive team, we're\nstill developing plays really well.
Yeah, everything's just the way we like it.
Okay guys, in the second half Azumaichi's\nprobably going to switch it up and push the\noffensive. Especially, right at the start.
Also, watch out for counter attacks,\nwhile developing the ball up field.
Okay!
That Soda guy's not bad.
Yeah,\nhe's actually keeping up with Tsubasa.
Plus, he's been putting the brakes on\nTsubasa's dribble.
We've gotta push even harder in the second half!
Don't worry! We'll crush 'em\nin the second half!
That's a fact.
Okay guys, keep your cool.\nThat's playing right into their hands.
Stick to the game plan,\nand you'll come out on top.
Yes!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
The fight isn't over yet!
Hey, Tsubasa.\nI know the other team's on your tail,\nbut I'm counting on you.
Okay, Coach.
(With everyone's morale up,\nI can't afford to let them know I'm hurt.)
Hey, Manabu.
Huh?
Oh, Okawa.
Nakazawa, get over here quick!
Huh?
Tsu-Tsubasa! Your leg!
Yeah, my injury from elementary school\npicked the perfect time to flare up again.
Can you tape it for me,\nso it doesn't get any worse?\nWe don't have a lotta time.
I will.
Manabu...\nDon't tell anybody, okay?
Okay.
Okay, I'm done.
Thanks.
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'll be fine.\nThere's winning to be done.
...Uh-huh.
They aren't the champs for nothin'.\nThey're managing to get past\nour defenders.
We won't fold that easily!\nCome on. Time to leave it all on the field.
Alright! That was a solid first half.
This works perfectly with our\ndefensive strategy.
I've got some good news.
That guy... Tsubasa Ozora's leg is hurt.\nI'm sure of it.
Wh-What?!
R-Really?!
Wh-What?!
Wh-What?!
And with Tsubasa injured, the only ones we need\nto worry about are Kisugi, Taki, and Izawa.
Keep marking your targets and keep them\naway from the goal.
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Alright,\nlet's keep it up in the second half!
Today, we eclipse Nankatsu!
We're about to begin the second half!
Will Nankatsu MS show us a dignified match\nbefitting the champions?
Or will Azumaichi MS cement their place\non the stage of history with an epic win?
We're about to begin the second half!
Who will break this deadlock?!\nOur champions from Nankatsu?\nOr will we see Azumaichi take over the field?
And there's the whistle!
We're about to begin the second half!
I'm sure Nankatsu would love to even out the\nscore, but if Azumaichi keeps the pressure on,\nthen Nankatsu may find themselves out in the cold.
And there's the whistle!
Tsubasa! You couldn't shake me \nbefore. What're you gonna do \non that bum leg?
(He knows about my leg...?!)
(This is it... fly or die!)
(Here I go, Roberto!)
Aw, man...
(I'm sorry, Roberto.\nI still can't get the hang of this shot.)
(Plus, this Drive Shot puts way more strain on\nmy pivot leg than I expected.)
(I won't be able to try that again this match.)
(Well, that was a shocker.)
(I've also thought about a drive shot that rises\nand sinks, but it's too hard to get the spin.)
(So I gave up on it, and went for the sharp\nhorizontal spin of the Razor Shot instead.)
(Tsubasa.\nI don't care how good you are,\nno one our age is pulling off a Drive Shot.)
(But with Tsubasa's injury, that last shot\nshould've hurt him a little more.)
(It's over, Tsubasa.\nYou're never getting away from me now.)
Tsubasa, is your leg okay?
Huh?
Us defenders are like keepers. We can see the\nwhole field and how everyone's moving.
Takasugi...
I'm fine.\nDon't worry about it.
Heh. Good.
Oh no, they got past us!
But, never fear.\nMy Razor Shot will even things out!
And this Razor Shot's got an extra blade!
Time to take care of business!\nEat this!
Time to take care of business!
Take this!
Morisaki, it's coming the other way this time!\nDive the other way!
What?!
Łoł!
Nice catch, Morisaki!
And there's the last whistle!\nThat's the game, folks!
Reigning champs Nankatsu MS win the match!\nThey're advancing to the second round!
Woohoo! We won!
We did it!
How could you know about my\nReverse Razor shot?!
I never let slip I had it\neven once in the qualifiers!
Yeah, I mean...\nIf Tsubasa hadn't told me which way to dive,\nthat shot would've probably gone in.
Call it a gut feeling, but I just kinda knew from\nthe angle of your pivot leg and the speed of your\nkick.
So I just shouted it out.
I see... The angle of my leg, huh?
Well, I've been working on my\nspin a lot, too.
Tsubasa...\nYour shot...That was a Drive Shot, wasn't it?
Good eye. It's not ready yet though.
That's a really challenging kick.\nI tried it myself, but couldn't make it work.
Master the Drive Shot, Tsubasa.
If any of us can, it's you.
Yeah.
By the way, how's your leg?
Yeah, it's fine.\nIt's a little wonky, but no big deal.
Okay, then.
Well, you beat us.\nNow ya gotta win the whole shebang.
I will.
Catch ya later, Tsubasa.\nWe'll meet again.
I can't believe we lost!
Quit your sobbing!\nWe're going home with our heads held high!
(Makoto Soda...\nMaybe he's not such a bad guy.)
And there's the last whistle!\nThat's the game, folks!
This epic showdown between reigning champ\nand rising star will all come down\nto a penalty shootout!
I never thought this game\nwould be such a struggle...
The match isn't over yet, boys!
We're in it to win it!
Not what I was hoping for, but this can work.
Alright!\nIt's do or die time!\nTime to win a shootout!
And that's game!
After a grueling match,\nNankatsu MS is one step closer to that coveted\nthird consecutive championship title!
Azumaichi MS couldn't quite make it happen\nout on the field, but they still put on an\nimpressive display!
And that's game!
And what an upset!\nThis tournament has been thrown into chaos!\nAll expectations are out the window!
Nankatsu MS lost their bid for this year's\nNationals to newcomers Azumaichi MS\nin a penalty shootout!
And there's the last whistle!\nThat's the game, folks!
And what an upset!\nThis tournament has been thrown into chaos\nwith the outcome of the very first match!
Nankatsu MS loses their bid for a third victory\nat Nationals to newcomers Azumaichi MS!
It's almost time for the match.\nMake sure to keep your bodies loose.
Gotcha, Coach!
Absolutely!
Roger!
For sure.
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
...
C-Captain!
Hyuga!
...!
Sorry, Coach, I just got back from Okinawa.
Hyuga!\nYou're the captain! What the heck do you think\nyou're doing at a crucial time like this?
Sorry isn't going to cut it this time!
What...?
You're benched for the entire tournament.
What?!
C-Coach!
The Second Day of the Tournament
Only one more match for today, huh?
It's not gonna get any easier from here on in.\nWe need to stay sharp.
A text message?
What?!
What is it? Who's it from?
How've you been, Tsubasa?\nI've been training every day to make the pros.
So Nationals musta already started in Japan.\nAnd of course, you're winning.
Always the victor... I don't need any details.\nJust text me if you lose, okay? I want to hear\nabout anyone who beats you.
By the way, I ran into a familiar face\nin Germany. Can you guess who?
Taro Misaki.
Apparently he's living in Paris now, with his\nartist father. So he came to visit me in Germany.
Guess my name came up in\nsome French soccer magazine.
We played some soccer for old time's sake,\nand his ball handling was as good as ever.\nI'd count on him turning pro in the future.
Good luck getting your third Nationals victory,\nTsubasa. We should play again sometime.\nBut until then... Auf Wiedersehen!
Welp, that's enough for today.\n—Genzo Wakabayashi
Misaki was in France?!
That certainly explains why we never saw him\nat any Japanese tournaments.
Thank goodness...\nHe's healthy and still playing soccer.
Should've figured!\nWakabayashi's still out there training hard.
Alright, let's win this thing,\nso we have good news to share with\nMisaki and Wakabayashi!
Yeah, for sure!
Alright, guys!\nLet's make today's practice count!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Oh man, I am just stuffed to the max.
That's fine, though, right?\nNot like we have practice or classes tonight.
Hey, are you doing anything after this?
I was gonna do some studying.
I was gonna go practice.
You're pulling my leg, right?
Although you are hardcore like that.
Maybe I'll tag along, then.
Hey boys, sorry for bugging you on your off time.
Oh, hey Mr. Katagiri.
I'd been looking for you guys.\nThere's something I wanted to talk about.
What's that?
See...
Mr. Cardinal's company has a game development\nstudio under its purview, and they're working\non a new soccer-based game.
And since you're square in the target demographic,\nthe developers want you all to playtest it.
Um, by "soccer-based game," does that mean\nit's not actually a soccer game?
From what they told me, it's essentially soccer,\nbut with a couple changes.
Like, the ball can't go out of bounds, and you can\nlay down traps on the pitch to steal the ball.
It also seems they want you to play very\naggressively, so you get penalized for extended\npossession. Quite different from regular soccer.
Huh. That sounds like quite a game.
Kinda neat to see people come up with something\nlike that. Their brains must work in an\ninteresting way.
Hahaha. To tell the truth, the person behind the\ngame is someone I've been friends with since\nelementary school.
He used to play soccer, too. But it's true...\nHe had some funny ideas, even in those days.
He always talked about wanting to try playing\ndifferently. Like with the cleats on the wrong\nfeet, with laces untied, using a rugby ball...
I played along, but it was so different from what\nI was used to that even trapping the ball became a\nchallenge.
Was there even a point to doing all that?
I didn't think so at first, but when we tried it\nI realized I couldn't play regularly.\nAnd I decided I couldn't let myself lose.
So, I tried to find a way to make it work, and\nbefore I knew it, we were having a blast playing\nin odd ways like that.
Ha! I think I kinda get it.
Bit of a different angle, but we've also given\nourselves challenges that we try really hard to\ncomplete.
I guess that's a sort of creativity when it comes\nto soccer, even if it's a little different from\nours.
Okay. Well, maybe it will be fun then.\nWon't know until we try!
What the...?! Was that my voice just now?
Oh, right. As a special treat, they referenced\nyour data for the game. They were really proud\nof how well they emulated it.
Hey, you wanna play with me? Might as well, right?
Let's do it. Should be fun!
I think I prefer regular soccer.
Sweet! Let's get started!
Aw, don't be like that.
Listen, I've read a lot of soccer comics and\nthe plays in those can be really exciting.\nThey can even make playing soccer more fun.
Maybe trying this game will have a similar effect\non you.
My friend said he wanted you to just have fun with\nit and not take it too seriously.
So, don't feel like you have to get super into it.\nGive it a go when you feel like it.

What a match! The teams engage in a tense\nback and forth, but it breaks in the second\nhalf as Meiwa Higashi takes the first goal!
With the ball loose right in front of Toho's\ngoal, Meiwa Higashi's Sliding Squad went into\naction, stealing away a point with a sliding shot!
This marks the very first point lost for Toho's\nWakashimazu and their defensive lineup in the\nentire tournament!
This small lead could very well advance Meiwa\nHigashi to the finals!
On the other side of the field, Toho's midfielder\nSawada may have led his team to the semi-finals,\nbut they're in poor form today.
Maybe it has something to do with playing their\nformer teammates from Meiwa Higashi, but their\nstrategies are being shut down consistently.
What a painful development for Toho Academy.\nThey made it to the finals the past two years,\nbut it looks like their streak is over.
(What a time for the Captain to be benched...)
(If only Hyuga were playing...)
Grah!
Hold it right there, Hyuga!
...!
Your cleats aren't touching that field!
Get back on the bench! NOW!
...
Order, orders, orders...
Who died and made you king?! You think you're\nalways absolutely right about everything?
D-Don't talk back to me!
Why?! Why won't you let me help my team?
Hyuga...
Don't lose, you guys! It's just one\npoint! I know you can still do this!
This is the last game you have to win without me!\nDo it for me!
Captain...
There's no way I'm sitting out the finals.
...
Alright guys, you heard the Captain! We just need\nto recover one point! That'll be a cinch!
That's right! If it's taken, take it back!\nThat's what soccer is!
Tak! We can make due without the Captain. We can\nwin this!
Alright!
Got it!
Tak!
Okay!
Tak!
Tak!
You guys are the greatest...
Whoa, and there's the final whistle!
The score is two to one!
Toho Academy turned it around in the final\nmoments!
The deciding play was Sawada's pass to Sorimachi.\nAnd who could believe it when Wakashimazu\noverlapped towards Meiwa's goal and scored?!
With this, Toho Academy is headed for its third\nconsecutive shot at taking home the championship!
Can you believe it? We did it! We did it, Captain!
Hyuga!
Great job! Real great work out there, guys!
(Right before the tournament, Hyuga abandoned his\nduties as captain, and left his team to train on\ntheir own.)
(Nevertheless, his teammates have never\nlost their faith in their beloved leader...)
...
Aw, man, and I was so sure we\ncould win with Hyuga sidelined.
Nah, Hyuga's strength extends beyond just himself.
Even from the bench, his encouragement won the \nday. If he weren't here altogether, maybe we \ncould've held on.
In the end, Toho is Hyuga's team.
Takeshi. Win the finals for us, alright?
Good luck. I still think of you as my teammate \nfrom Meiwa FC.
Th-Thank you!
And Wakashimazu... Secure that net against all\nattacks tomorrow.
Cuz I want to go down as the only man to score on\nyou!
Heh. You got it!
(So that's Meiwa Higashi. They've been drilled by\nCoach Kira ever since they were tykes.)
(Toho's made it this far without Hyuga.\nThey've compensated in his absence.)
(In order to do that, every player is bringing\ntheir A-game. Each game has polished their\nteamwork even more.)
(If Hyuga had been there from the first match,\nI'm sure they would've relied on him.)
(But he wasn't...and because he wasn't, that gave\nbirth to the feeling that they had to do this\nthemselves.)
(Now, every last player on the team is a\nterrifying force to be reckoned with.)
(And if you throw Hyuga on top of that...)
Today's opponents are Furano MS. They've turned\ntheir tenacious teamwork into a powerful weapon\non both sides of the ball.
They're led by Captain Matsuyama, whose skill can\ndominate the field.
In other words, pin him down, take control of the\nmidfield, and the rest will take care of itself.
Looks good!
Our teamwork is just as solid. But\nthe tougher the other team the\ntougher we need to be! Got it?
Racja!
That's right!
Yes, Coach!
Yessir!
Yessir!
Yessir!
You okay, Tsubasa? How are you healing?
Yeah. Both my leg and my shoulder\nare as good as new.
Even if they weren't, I wouldn't miss these next\ntwo games for any reason!
Well, if you're that ready to go,\nthen the rest of the team just\nhasta get fired up as well!
It's hot today, but we can't let that slow us\ndown.
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Today's opponents are likely the best team we'll\nplay in the entire tournament.
Don't worry about saving anything for tomorrow,\nleave it all out on the field today!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Even if he's injured, the biggest threat from\nNankatsu is definitely Tsubasa Ozora.
But that means that if we can pin him\ndown, we can win this game.
So I want you marking him, Matsuyama.
You can count on me, Coach!
Alright, so grab a stamina drink\nbefore the match, and get to it.
Fujisawa!
...
What's the matter, Fujisawa?
What's that you're holding?
U-Um, actually... I made headbands\nfor everyone on the team.
Headbands?
I mean, I guess none of the other teams wear\nheadbands, but...
Let me see those.
Ah!
Łoł! You made these for the whole team? That's a\nlotta work.
Hey, isn't Fujisawa moving to America next\nsemester?
I see...
...
Alright! Yoshiko went through a lot of trouble\nmaking these for us, so we're wearing them!
We're adding a little flash to the uniform, today!
Tak! I agree!
Tak! Awesome!
Tak! I agree!
Tak! I agree!
Tak! I agree!
Tak! I agree!
Dude, this makes me feel like I could run a\nhundred miles!
Yeah, it stands out a bit, but it's pretty cool.
Matsuyama...
Actually, I embroidered each\nplayer's number on to them.
Whoa, that's really cool!
Thanks, Yoshiko!
Glad you like it.
Alright folks, the second match of the\nsemi-finals is just about to commence!
Hokkaido's Furano MS vs Shizuoka's Nankatsu MS!
The team captains are facing off in the center of\nthe field, each playing midfield and sporting the\nnumber ten on his back.
No doubt control of the\nmidfield will be key to this match.
Now, let's find out which of these teams will go\non to face Toho in the finals tomorrow!
We're already hearing thunderous cheers from the\nstands on either side!
And to raucous applause, the players are taking\nthe field!
Oh, what is this? The players of Furano MS all\nappear to be sporting headbands!
It's a true show of unity in how much they're\ncommitted to taking that finals spot from Nankatsu\nthis year!
Tsubasa, our hard work will win the day against\nyou and Nankatsu. We're about to prove it.
I'm not losing, Matsuyama.
(Just two more to go. No way I'm losing.)
(I can't lose, not in Japan.)
(The favorites to make finals are Nankatsu and\nToho.)
(Where Furano falls behind is in goals.)
(We're definitely just as good in terms of\ndefense and teamwork, so if we can just score\nsome goals, I know we can be the champs.)
(But I'm not a prodigy born with\ntalent like Tsubasa or Hyuga.)
(And that's why training has been everything!\nHard work can trump talent and overtake it!)
(I'll show you just how mighty my hard work has\nmade me!)
(Please win, Matsuyama.)
(Please don't injure yourself any further,\nTsubasa...)
Let's go, Tsubasa!
I'm not taking it easy on you just\nbecause you got a little\nboo-boo!
I won't lose, Matsuyama!
Follow the captain's lead,\neveryone!
Our team has more players \nthan just Tsubasa!
Time to show 'em how we work\nas a team!
Whoever controls the midfield...
Controls the universe!
I'm not letting you have the\nmidfield!
You're not taking this midfield from us!
I'm not letting you have the midfield!
Move up, guys! Time for \nan Avalanche Attack!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
What could this be? Furano's entire team is pressing forward!
Time for you to learn the strength of the frozen\nnorth!
Here it is, folks! Matsuyama's soil-scattering,\nhigh-powered Northern Country Shot!
A shot only made possible by legs steeled through\nintense training on the ever-shifting, snowy\nground of the Furano home field!
Tak! We pulled it off, guys!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
He...He got us.
No ordinary goalie could stop that!
The Captain's longshot is unstoppable!
It's just as powerful as your Drive Shot,\nTsubasa.
(I can only imagine how much training it took to\nperfect that shot, Matsuyama.)
Oh, thank goodness!
Agh!
Hey, what's wrong?
That shot just now shook my shoulder...!
Tsubasa!
Matsuyama...
You alright, Tsubasa?
Thanks, Matsuyama.
I don't need your thanks.
If I'm going to mop you up, I want it to be fair\nand square.
So they caught up, huh?
We're only tied! It's like the game just started.
Yeah, that's right!
Okay, let's get 'em!
(You trust your teammates, Matsuyama.\nAnd so they trust you right back.)
Tsubasa! We believe in you, too!\nWe know you won't let us down.
Tak!
Fight to the finish, Tsubasa!
You guys...
Okay, let's turn this around\nwith the time we have left!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Alright! We caught up!
We've not crossed the finish line yet, Captain.\nWe're still only tied.
Now it's time for us to get in the lead!
Yup. Alright, let's get 'em!
Nice one, Matsuyama.
We're still tied.\nThe match is just beginning, Tsubasa!
Yeah, just one more in the net and we're ahead!
Yup! So don't lose focus!
I don't know what to say...
Okay, let's turn this around\nwith the time we have left!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
I'll be taking this goal!
Not if I have anything to do\nwith it!
And it's already halftime!
With Nankatsu coming in with the lead,\nthey're that much closer to the finals!
And it's already halftime!
As you'd expect from the semi-finals, the\ncompetition is evenly matched, and the score\nthus far tied!
This game will have to be settled in the second\nhalf!
And it's already halftime!
Furano really showed us what makes them special\nand what got them here! Are they headed to\ntheir first finals?
Or can Nankatsu mount a comeback?
Alright everyone, good hustle out there.\nKeep it up.
I won't let you down, Sir!
Yes, Coach!
Roger that!
Yes, Coach!
Tak!
Roger that!
You still good to go, Tsubasa?
Yeah, I'm good.
(I can't lose. Definitely not here in Japan.)
(I have to live up to everyone's trust in me too.\nI'll decide this in the second half with my\nnewly perfected Drive Shot.)
(You can't fool me, Tsubasa! You're\ntrying to hide your injuries.)
(But that just means it's up to the rest of the\nteam to make up the difference.)
Alright guys,\nlet's stay focused in the second half too.
If we lose here today, then there is no tomorrow.
So don't hold anything back\nand beat Furano!
With you all the way!
When have we ever held back?
Didn't even cross our minds!
There was never any doubt!
We're gonna be the first team\nto ever score three National victories!
Tak!
Tak!
Woohoo!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
(Nankatsu's been called a one-man team made up of\njust Tsubasa.)
(But it's never been that.)
(Tsubasa's injuries are holding him back at the\nmoment, but the team still made it this far by\nworking together.)
(Plus, as the captain he's trying to keep morale\nup by masking his pain and playing through it.)
(I feel comfortable saying that Nankatsu is the\nbest team in Japan.)
(Even as champions for the past two years, as a\ncoach, I've never been prouder than I am right\nnow.)
(My place is on the sidelines.)
(C'mon guys, just one last push. That's all you\nneed.)
Alright everyone, time to fight like you mean it.\nDon't lose to the heat!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Let's go guys! Focus on today and not tomorrow!
It's full steam ahead into the second half!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
(I know you can do it.)
(People talk an awful lot. They say things like,\nwe can't handle heat, we burn out before the\nsecond half, or that we're no match for Nankatsu.)
(But consider this: it's been hot every single\nday, yet you've still won. You made it this far in\nunfavorable conditions.)
(Matsuyama is our only stand out player, but you\nall contribute to every win.)
(You are the Furano team. And no team trains\nharder than Furano.)
(I just want you to have the opportunity to win.)
(Matsuyama, I'm counting on you to be the\nheart of this team and lead it to victory.)
(No matter how bad you're hurt, you always push\nyourself as far as you can, Tsubasa.)
(And all I can do is pray.)
(Pray that you won't get hurt any worse.)
(If Furano loses, I'll be leaving for America in\nthe morning...)
(But that aside, right now, I just want them to\nwin.)
(Matsuyama and the others have worked so hard for\nthis. I wish I could just give them the win.)
We're witnessing explosive action today, folks!\nBoth captains are clashing in stupendous fashion!\nJust what can we expect in the second half?
If everyone on their team is working\ntogether on offense, then we'll do the same!
Everyone from forward to defense, we're\npooling all of Nankatsu's skill together!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Heh. Well, we're not going down without a fight\neither!
Whether on offense or defense, Furano stands\nunited!
Each and every one of us battles together!\nRight, guys?
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
(We won't lose, Tsubasa!)
(I'm not losing to you, Matsuyama...!)
And the second half is finally here!
Will the champions Nankatsu hold onto their lead?\nOr can the tenacious Furano turn it around?
And the second half is finally here!
Nankatsu or Furano? Which of these two teams will\ngo on to face Toho in the finals?!
And the second half is finally here!
Can Furano from the north stay in control of this\nblazing hot match? Or will the reigning\nchampions mount a comeback?!
Nankatsu didn't win two years in a row for no\nreason.
They've really come together as a team.
Are we gonna be outpaced in teamwork, too?
What's wrong, you guys? Don't talk like we've\nalready lost! There's still plenty of time on the\nclock!
Captain!
Now, let's do this! This is just the beginning!
Y-Yes!
Y-Yes, Coach!
R-Right!
Y-Yes!
Y-Yes!
Y-Yes!
(C'mon, Nankatsu! I got something to show you.)
We can't just rely on the\nCaptain!
Time for us to score a goal on\nour own!
Captain...
Not much time left...\nGuess we can't beat Nankatsu after all...
Ugh... This is on me. I'm our main striker! If I'd\npulled it together we could've made it...
...
Oda, you're going to high school in Asahikawa,\nright?
Huh?
And Yamamuro... I think you're headed to an\nagricultural school?
And Wakamatsu's always loved tinkering with\nmachines, so he's going to an engineering school.
Kondo is going to be helping out on the family\nfarm right after graduating middle school.
Captain...
Y'know, this has been on my mind since before the\ntournament.
Ever since elementary school, we've all been able\nto play soccer together.
But after this summer break, after this\ntournament, that's all coming to an end.
If we lose, then this is the last game we'll ever\nplay together. That's what keeps going through my\nhead, anyway.
So...
So I want us to give this everything we've got,\neverything we've built together leading up to\ntoday!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
When I beat you, Tsubasa, this match \nwill be ours for the\ntaking.
When I shut you down Matsuyama, \nwe'll be well on our way\nto finals.
This is it!
I won't lose!
It's on!
It's on!
It's on!
Trust in the Captain! Head for\nthe goal!
It's our turn to help Tsubasa out! \nSupport his moves on the\nfield!
The match isn't over yet...
Kisugi, Taki. As soon as the match restarts,\npass it to me.
What are you thinking, Tsubasa? What can you do\nwhile you're all banged up?
I agree. It doesn't matter how good you are,\nyou're just being reckless now.
Just pass to Tsubasa, you two.
Huh?
Tsubasa's our captain.
So we follow him to the end of the world. That's\nthe first and last word on that.
Ishizaki!
We're counting on you, Captain Tsubasa.
Thank you, Ishizaki.
(After you graduate middle school, you're leaving\nus for Brazil.)
(But I'm happy for you. Honest.)
(Even if we lose this match, I'll have no regrets\nabout how we played and the time we had.)
(I mean, we've been able to play soccer together\nthis whole time, haven't we...?)
Thank you, everyone!
I'm betting everything on this!
My Drive Shot...
Take to the heavens!
Like a phoenix taking flight...!
What?!
What is...? It's a miracle!
The ball hit the goalpost, but it's\nremaining spin took it into the net!
Just like a phoenix, Tsubasa's Drive Shot comes\nback to life!
And there's the final whistle!\nThat's the game, folks!
Nankatsu is heading to the finals!
They're one step closer to a legendary third\nchampionship win!
W-We... did... it.
What's up with you? Well, I guess you won, so\nyou've earned a little rest.
Matsuyama...
But y'know, a fellow like you...
A fellow like you never calls it quits. Not until\nit's really, truly over.
I think your Drive Shot tells that same story.
The way it flies towards the goal, unwavering,\neven after hitting a post... I think that's just\nlike you, Tsubasa.
Anyway, get some rest. You've got finals tomorrow.
Thanks, Matsuyama.
...
You really are something else, y'know? You put so\nmuch strength into your shots, even when you've\nbeen kicked around more than a practice ball.
Matsuyama...
Take pride in it.
Just make sure you also win the finals, got it?
Alright, on your feet guys!
We've gotta bid adieu to our fans in the stands!
C-Captain...
Line up!
Thank you for your support, everyone!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
You were great, Furano!
Win or lose, your teamwork is the fiercest in\nJapan!
Even after a devastating loss, Furano's players\nremember to thank their supporters!
But they really did fight the good fight, these\nwarriors from the land of ice and snow!
(Hikaru Matsuyama... You lost, but...)
(You have nothing to be ashamed of.)
(And with that...)
(Our soccer ends.)
And there's the final whistle!
Even after sixty minutes of sublime soccer from\nboth sides, we're no closer to a conclusion!
Now, which team will win the penalty shootout\nthat will decide who goes to finals?
(Guh...\nC'mon, body, don't break on now...\nJust a little longer!)
Tsubasa.
Izawa...
Even if I told you to leave the rest to us...
You wouldn't listen, would you?
...
I believe in you, Captain!
Thank you...
Listen up guys, we fought with everything we had\nfor the full sixty minutes, and we haven't lost\nyet.
What I want to say is, we took control of this\ngame. And now, we've got 'em right where we want\n'em.
So believe in yourselves. We can do this!
Yessir!
We're gonna win this for sure, Captain!
After this shootout, we've got one last game of\nsoccer to enjoy together!
The tremendous struggle is finally at an end!
The champions from Nankatsu dominated\nthe shootout and are advancing to the finals!
It's been a long road, but now there remains just\none more step on the road to a legendary third\nchampionship win!
The tremendous struggle is finally at an end!
The boys from the north, Furano, have beaten the\nreigning champions from Nankatsu in a tense\npenalty shootout!
Nankatsu was so close to a third finals win, so\nclose it seemed inevitable, but now they're\nheaded home without achieving that dream.
And there's the final whistle!
Putting their amazing teamwork on display,\nFurano shoves Nankatsu aside and advances to the\nfinals!
Nankatsu's dream of a third championship win has\ndried up in the summer heat!
(Yoshiko...)
(I'm sorry we didn't win. Even after you made\nthese headbands to get us psyched up...)
(Wait, what's this?)
(Right on the edge of the headband, in small,\nunobtrusive lettering... Written in white thread\non white cloth...)
What's wrong, Captain?
...!
Captain?
Coach, where's Yoshiko?!
Oh, her mom came to pick her up.\nThey already left.
Wha--?
I got the impression they were headed to America\nto live with her dad.
You guys really owe her a lot, so I was\nhoping you could all say goodbye after the\ngame, but I guess they were in a hurry.
What?!
Hey! Matsuyama!
(Her car must still be around here somewhere...)
Could that be it?
Fujisawa!
Fuji--!
D-Darn it!
(She sewed that message into my headband.)
"I love you. -Yoshiko"
(Matsuyama...)
(Of course, it ends like this...)
(I'll never get to tell you...)
Fujisawa!
Huh...?
I...I made it in time!
H-How did you get here?
After you left, a man from the Soccer Association\ngave me a lift in his car.
I got here as fast as I could.
Matsuyama...
Oh no! Your leg's bleeding!
What is it?
Hold still.
Don't do that! It'll get your handkerchief dirty.
Shush. Look at how much you're bleeding.
I guess, this is the last time you'll look after\nme like this.
It's because you push yourself too hard. You're\nalways getting yourself hurt.
Hah!\nWell, when ya put it like that...\nI'd rather you say I played my heart out.
There, done.\nThat should staunch it.
Thank you, Fujisawa.
Is something the matter?
I mean, you just suddenly showed up, and--
C'mon, you hafta know...
I chased after your taxi when I saw you leaving,\nand tried to call out to you... Because you left\nwithout telling me...
Heh, I got this scrape trying to catch you.
Hey, don't cry.
But--
If you cry...
How will you dry your tears?\nYour handkerchief is wrapped around my knee.
Matsuyama!
Wha--!
If I have to watch you leave, I want to remember\nyou smiling.
I'll try.
I'll always keep this headband to remember you\nby. I'll keep it somewhere safe. I owe you a lot.
It makes me so happy to hear that.
Where'd the captain go? It's getting late.
Don't tell me he chased her all the way to the\nairport...
In a taxi? C'mon, where would he get that kind of\ndough?
Hmmm? Hold on, I don't recognize this number...
Hello?
Coach.
Matsuyama?
Sorry, Coach. I'm at the airport.
So you really did chase Yoshiko all the way there.
I'm getting a ride from someone with the\nSoccer Association, so you can head to the hotel\nwithout me.
All right, I'll do just that.
So the Captain really went to the airport?
Well, if there's one thing you can say about him,\nit's that he sees things through.
I mean, we all kinda knew how Fujisawa felt about\nthe Captain, but...
How do you think he felt about her?
We'll just have to grill him when he gets back.
Just keep the torture to a minimum.
Ha!
*laughter*
*laughter*
*laughter*
*laughter*
*laughter*
Even after everything I said you still went ahead\nand pushed yourself.
Don't blame me if you end up having to sit out\ntomorrow.
If I hadn't, we wouldn't have won today.
I needed to win. I needed to be in the finals\ntomorrow.
Sheesh, what am I going to do with you?
But you had everything to do with my success,\nDoctor. Both your treatment and the message of\n"Always a Winner" you wrote on my bandage.
Wait, did you seriously write that, Doc?
...Yeah. I guess I did.
Doctor, do you think you could write\n"Always a Winner" right here?
"Always a Winner"?
Because I have to win today's match, no matter\nwhat.
I'll win, and then face Hyuga in the finals.
But Hyuga's been kept on the bench in every match\nso far.
Yeah, but there's no way he won't be playing\ntomorrow.
(Kojiro Hyuga is my greatest rival in Japan.)
(And this will be my final match\nwith him, here in Japan.)
Doctor.
Yeah?
You can tell me it's reckless, but you can't keep\nme from playing in the finals tomorrow.
...
Guess I'll need to make sure to bring my full kit\nto the stadium tomorrow, then.
But as for tonight, stay here at the hospital.
Indeed.
(As expected, the finals will be between Nankatsu\nand Toho. This final battle between Tsubasa Ozora\nand Kojiro Hyuga shall be momentous.)
(What worries me though is Hyuga. Will he be on\nthe field tomorrow?)
(And even if he is, how much will he have grown,\ncompared to Tsubasa? Will he offer a challenge?)
(To be frank, Hyuga's done little to live up\nto my expectations in the past two years.)
(In elementary school, he was a raging tiger\nwhose fiery spirit kept Tsubasa, Misaki, and\nWakabayashi on their toes.)
(But ever since entering middle school, he's lost\nsome of that hunger, and his play reflects it.)
(For the sake of Japanese soccer, I deeply hope\nand pray to bear witness to the rebirth of the\nFierce Tiger, Kojiro Hyuga.)
(Tsubasa is moving to Brazil.)
(So without him in the country, the only one I can\ncount on to keep up the level of Japanese soccer\nis...)
(You, Hyuga!)
A letter? For me?
This is from...!
(Dear Mr. Makoto Kitazumé, coach of Toho Academy:)
(I write to you concerning a request.)
(Please, find it in your heart to forgive Kojiro\nHyuga, and allow him to take the field alongside\nhis team in the finals.)
(I was the one who invited him to come to Okinawa\nto rekindle his warrior spirit under my guidance.)
(I completely understand how irresponsible it was\nfor him to abandon his duties as captain without\nconsulting you first at such a critical time.)
(But his heart was in the right place. All he\nwanted was to better prepare himself, and to\nstrengthen his team in so doing.)
(Please, consider his error in light of how it\nshows his passion for the sport, and forgive the\nmistake. I think he's earned it.)
...
Coach, I would like to talk to you.
What is it?
I discussed this with everyone on the team, and we\nall agree.
So please understand that I'm here speaking for\neveryone when I say this.
...
Please, let Hyuga play in the finals tomorrow!
If you still can't let him join us on the pitch...
We'll all boycott the match!
...
Captain!
Hyuga!
Coach.
...
You know me, I'd rather die than beg for handouts.
But... This is for the team.
Captain?
You don't need to do this!
Please! I could live a hundred years, but if I\ndon't play in the finals tomorrow...\nThere'd be no point.
(I didn't realize I'd gone soft until Coach Kira\nspoke up.)
(So I went to Okinawa and trained under him. Now\nthe old hunger dwells within me again. I feel\nit with every breath, in every bone of my body.)
(And I need to prove that it was all worth it!)
(But if I don't play in the finals, this'll have\nall been a waste.)
We're begging you, too, Coach!\nPlease let Hyuga play!
Sure, it was stupid of him to go off on his own\nlike that.
But he did it for the team! He did it so we could\nfinally beat Nankatsu! He put himself through the\ntoughest training he could find to help the team.
We're begging you, Coach!
Let the captain play!
Let our Captain play!
Let the captain play!
Let the captain play!
Let the captain play!
Let the captain play!
Y-You all...
...
...
Everyone, we're heading to the field. Now.
Huh?
Hyuga, as we are now, Toho can win the Nationals\nwith or without you.
...
But Coach!
Our forward, Sorimachi, our midfielder, Sawada,\nand our goalie, Wakashimazu... Every one of these\nboys has that same drive.
Hyuga.
If you can score a goal on these three, I'll let\nyou join them on the field tomorrow.
I'll hold you to that.
But if any of you three hold back because you\nwant him to play, then the deal is off.
You won't fool me.
You got that?
R-Roger that.
R-Roger that.
Y-Yessir!
Y-Yes.
You ready?
I am.
Blow the whistle!
(He's right, we can't trick him, and just let\nHyuga prove himself.)
I'm coming at you with everything I've got, Hyuga!
Nothing will stand in my way!
Huh?!
My Tiger Shot will bring Tsubasa to his knees!
Wha--!
Wh-What the--?!
What the...?!
After winning their first match, Nankatsu MS's\nnext opponent was the representative\nfrom Kanagawa: Nishikigaoka MS.
To let Tsubasa recover from his injury in\nthe first game, the rest of the team rose to the\noccasion and went above and beyond.
In the end, they won with a remarkable 6 to 0\nfinal score, and advanced in the tournament.
And now, their third opponent will be\nthe representative team from Akita: Hanawa MS.
Here they face the Tachibana brothers, Masao and\nKazuo, who may've lost to Tsubasa in the past,\nbut now have a secret plan to take down Nankatsu.
The Tachibana brothers of Hanawa MS\nspecialize in an acrobatic style of soccer.
Don't get dazzled by their flashy moves.\nThat's just what they want.
Make sure you set the pace, and find some of that\nmomentum from yesterday's match with Nishigaoka.\nNow go get 'em!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Let's do this, Masao.
Ready when you are.
At Nationals for elementary school, we may've\nbeen beaten by the Nankatsu Golden Duo\nof Tsubasa and Misaki.
But Misaki's not here now.
That means now we're the most\ndangerous duo around!
You've never seen anything\nlike our aerial soccer!
Well folks, Nankatsu vs Hanawa is about to begin\nand we're already hearing cheers from both\nschools' stands!
It sounds like Hanawa's fans have doubled\nfrom yesterday! This crowd came all the way from\ntheir hometown of Akita to make some noise.
That's just how fired up they are to beat the\nreigning champions, Nankatsu!
Heh... Been a while, Tsubasa.
Yeah, not since elementary school.
Leave it all on the field today, guys!
Sorry, but we're breaking Nankatsu's win streak.
Gah! Not happening! We're ready for\nyour little aerial soccer gimmicks.
Well, you're chipper. We're counting\non you to score on your own goal again!
What?!
Hope you're ready, Tsubasa!
Without Misaki, you're all alone.
And we're unstoppable!
And we're unstoppable!
And we're unstoppable!
You're right, Misaki isn't here.
But I'm not alone...
Didn't you notice?\nMy whole team came, too!
Taste our Triangle Shot!
Whoa there!\nKazuo Tachibana is jumping toward the goal post!
This is the Tachibana brothers' specialty!\nThey kick off the goal post to shoot from high in\nthe sky!
The Triangle Shot!
Not so fast!
What in the--?!
Ishizaki demonstrates some quick thinking!\nBy rattling the post,\nKazuo can't jump off of it!
And Morisaki easily catches the ball!
See that?\nYour aerial soccer is a joke!
Nice, Ishizaki!
Even a broken clock's right twice\na day.
Oh, is the monkey trying to play soccer? Cute.
Hah!\nWell, there was that one time\nI scored an own goal back in the day.
Agh!
Guess they've left us no\nchoice.
Yeah, Masao.
Kazuo!
Now!
Woohoo!
What?!
Here it goes!
Our new midair technique!
Here it goes!
Our new midair technique!
Here it goes! Our new midair technique!
Skylab Hurricane!
Skylab Hurricane!
Skylab Hurricane!
What just...?
Remember this!\nThis is the true heart\nof acrobatic soccer!
That is the majesty of the Tachibanas'\nmidair techniques! My eyes don't\neven know what they've just seen!
Heh. Did you catch that, Nankatsu?\nThat's our Skylab Hurricane!
We were just warming up!
And that's the whistle for halftime!
Despite the Tachibana brothers' fearsome play,\nNankatsu maintains the lead!
And that's the whistle for halftime!
Despite the Tachibana brothers' amazing play,\nNankatsu held their own, and\nboth teams are looking for any advantage!
And that's the whistle for halftime!
The Tachibana brothers' aerial soccer has\nexploded onto the scene! Hanawa MS usurps the\nlead from Nankatsu!
Skylab Hurricane...\nThat smells like trouble.
But there's no way that trick didn't\nwear out their legs a bit.
There's no way they can keep\nthose shots coming forever.
Tak! That makes sense.\nI think you're right.
Anyway, they'll play their game,\nbut we gotta play ours.
Don't let them get in your head.\nFocus on our soccer!
Alright, well, we got a\nsecond half to win.
Kazuo, how are your legs holding up?
Yeah, I'm still good.
Just making sure. You know we need to be careful\nabout the strain that shot puts on us.
Yeah, special occasions only.\nWe only get so many of those a game.
But we can handle another thirty minutes,\nright Masao?
You know it!
The Skylab Hurricane represents a lotta\nblood, sweat, and tears.\nAnd now it's gonna win us this match!
Daimaru, right at the start of the second half,\ngot it? Counting on you!
Heh... Yeah, I gotcha!
That Skylab Hurricane...\nHow are we ever gonna stop that?
I dunno if I can pull it off,\nbut I have an inkling.
For real?
You better believe it.\nNext time they come at us,\nI'll see if I can make some magic happen.
Plus, there's no way their legs can\nkeep up under that kinda strain\nforever.
Tak! That makes sense.\nI think you're right.
Anyway, they'll play their game,\nbut we gotta play ours.
Don't let them get in your head.\nFocus on our soccer!
Yeah.\nLet's win this second half!
We did it, Masao!
It's too soon to celebrate.\nThere's still the second half.
Yeah, you're right. We are taking on Tsubasa,\nafter all.
Make sure you're looking after your legs.\nWe can't use our technique indiscriminately.\nWatch your limits.
But we should be able to make it another thirty\nminutes.
That you can.
The Skylab Hurricane represents a lotta\nblood, sweat, and tears.\nAnd now it's gonna win us this match!
Daimaru, right at the start of the second half,\ngot it? Counting on you!
Heh... Yeah, I gotcha!
Now for the second half!
Can the Tachibana brothers' acrobatic soccer\nturn the tables on the champions,\nNankatsu MS?!
The whistle's about to blow!
Now for the second half!
Which of these aces will control the match,\nNankatsu's Tsubasa or Hanawa's\nTachibana brothers?
The whistle's about to blow!
Now for the second half!
In the first half, the Tachibana brothers'\nacrobatic soccer made a mockery of the\nNankatsu defense! Can they mount a comeback?
The whistle's about to blow!
Heh, here it goes!
Here we go, Kazuo!
Time to bring it!
No way!
Even if I'm on my own now... I can still fly!
Aaah!
Masao!
(He's gonna crack his skull open,\nunless I do something!)
Are you okay, Masao?!
Tsubasa... He took the fall for me.
Huh?!
Tsubasa!
M-My shoulder...
Tsubasa!
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. It's just a scratch.
I can still fl--ugh!
Tsubasa!\nSomeone get the first aid kit!\nGet the medical team!
Yeah, on it!\nRef! Tsubasa's swapping out!
Uaaah!
Both teams took a water break while Tsubasa\nreceived emergency treatment, but looks like he's\nback on the field.
He appeared to have a dislocated shoulder, folks.\nIs he really okay to play?
You okay, Tsubasa?
Yeah. It looked worse than it was.
I won't be able to block like that again,\nbut trust me, I can play.
Now c'mon, it's time to leave it all\non the field. Fly or die!
Don't think we're going to\ntake it easy on you, Tsubasa!
Yeah, it's still all on the\nline for us, too!
Gah, guess our legs\nhave reached their limits.
Seems so... Darn it!
Oh well, like Coach says...\nIt's all about fundamentals.
You're about to witness the\nbest combination play in\nJapan!
Get ready for the show!
Here we go, Kazuo!
Sure!
This is the pure, the powerful,\nthe one, the only...
Twin Shot!
Twin Shot!
Twin Shot!
(Hanawa's put up a tight defense...\nSo, in that case...!)
Aw, c'mon! It's still not right.\nThat time I thought I had it for sure...
And there's the final whistle!
Nankatsu MS is the first to advance\nto the top eight!
Even with their aerial soccer, the Tachibana\nbrothers couldn't reach Tsubasa\nsoaring high above!
How is he, Doctor?
For now, taping his shoulder\nshould be enough.
However, I'm concerned that if he bumps it,\nit'll pop right back out again.
But, well, as long as he avoids any hard contact,\nhe can continue to play.
I see...
Thank you very much, Doctor.
Just doing my job.\nInjuries are part and parcel of soccer.
Plus, it'd be a shame for Nankatsu to lose\nthat historic third victory because their\nstar player was injured.
How's your shoulder, Tsubasa?
Tachibana!
I dunno what to say...\nThis is all my fault. Sorry...
It's not your fault. It's part of the game.\nBut I appreciate you worrying about me.
That was a nice match, Chimpy.
Oh, real funny!
Play hard out there for us, too, okay?\nIf we had to lose, it better have been to only the\nbest.
Sure thing.
You can count on us!\nWe are the best. And we're gonna win!
And that's it for the second half!
Both sides have sustained injuries as they\nhead into the penalty shootout\nto see who makes it into the top eight!
Ugh...!
You okay, Tsubasa?!
Yeah. This is nothing...
Just a little further to go...\nLet's win this shootout!
A penalty shootout...
I wish our Skylab Hurricane\nwasn't so rough on the legs.
But we made it this far!
Yeah, and the finish line is just ahead!
And that's the game!
By winning the penalty shootout, Nankatsu MS\nnarrowly becomes the first team\nto squeeze into the top eight.
But of course, Hanawa's magnificent\naerial soccer cannot go overlooked!
And that's the game!
After an intense struggle, Nankatsu's dreams of a\nthird victory at Nationals have been dashed,\nthanks to Hanawa's shootout skills!
And of course, not enough can be said\nabout the spectacle of their aerial soccer!
And there's the final whistle!
And Nankatsu's dreams of a third National\nvictory have ended in defeat!
The Tachibana brothers' aerial soccer managed to\nclip Tsubasa's wings!
Hey, isn't that Hyuga and Matsuyama over there?
Oh, you're right!
Hyuga, why were you benched last match?
Don't tell me you're injured?
It ain't that.
Then, why?!
It's none of your business.
You bet your butt it is!
You don't remember our fight in the cafeteria?\nBack at elementary school Nationals?
I still owe you some payback for that\non the field. Don't you dare\ndeny me the chance.
Hmph. An old story from a different time...
Anyway, we're going to beat Tsubasa,\nand then I'm coming for you\nin the finals.
I dunno what your deal is,\nbut you best be off that bench\ncome finals time.
What, you didn't play today either, Hyuga?!
Ishizaki...
You might think your bracket's a cake walk,\nbut you underestimate 'em, and one of those teams\nis going to send you packing.
You have an obligation to get to finals!
Don't you worry, I'll be there\nwaiting for you!
So you aren't injured, Hyuga?
...Naw.
Then, see you in the finals!\nNankatsu versus Toho for the third and final time!\nFor all the glory!
Ugh...
...
Well, what 'bout you? You'd better not be\ninjured before the finals! There's no point in\ncrushing you if you're not at your best!
...Until then.
Hyuga!
What, Takeshi?
I just ran into Misugi from Musashi MS.\nHe told me to give you a message.
Oh?\nSo what'd he say?
"You're the only one who can beat Tsubasa.\nLooking forward to the finals."
Tsk...
(What is with these guys...)
(I never asked for their worry or concern.)
Um... Hyuga?
(Just you wait. I'm not stayin' on that bench!)
(And I will win this championship!)
Ugh!
Łoł!
What the...?!
Łoł!
On the fifth day of the tournament, the stage is\nset for the top eight teams to prove their moxie!
The first match goes to Meiwa Higashi MS,\nrepresenting Saitama, with a team composed of\neight players from Hyuga's elementary school team.
Despite Hyuga sitting out, the second match is\neasily won by Toho Academy, representing Tokyo,\nthanks to the efforts of Wakashimazu and Sawada.
Of the remaining two matches, the first is\nbetween Furano MS, from Hokkaido, and\nMinamiuwa MS, of Ehime.
The fourth and final match is between Nankatsu MS,\nrepresenting Shizuoka, and Hirado MS, fighting for\nNagasaki.
Furano MS Soccer Club Assistant\nYoshiko Fujisawa
...Yes, Mom, I understand.
When the soccer team loses, we'll move to America\nto be with Dad...
Yes... Got it... Alright, bye.
(So at best, I'm in Japan for\nanother three days...)
(Can I leave it like this...?)
(Matsuyama...)
Fujisawa! The coach is looking for you!
O-Oh, okay.\nI'll be right there.
Yup.
Oh, um, Matsuyama?
Yeah?
...
...?
Um...\nDo your best out there today.
Uh...sure.
Well, see ya later!
(It's okay... I can leave it at that for now.)
(There's no way Matsuyama's losing yet.)
What a shocking turn of events we've seen in the\nthird match of the quarterfinals!
Furano MS, led by Matsuyama, has shown us\noutstanding teamwork so far and are considered the\nthird favorite to win after Nankatsu and Toho.
But somehow they're down one to first\ntime participants Minamiuwa MS, led by the player\nbeing called Ishida the Technician!
Right away, Ishida passed to his center forward,\nTakei, who snuck one past Furano's keeper\nwith a well-placed header, to take an early lead!
Ishida seems well-read in Furano MS's\nquick passing game, and they\nseem unable to take back control.
They've also missed two chances for a comeback\nwith center forward Oda's shots on goal going\nwide! They just can't put it in the net!
Can Minamiuwa MS manage an upset\nagainst a favorite to win Nationals?
This is all my fault...\nIf only I'd...
Hmph. I don't care how good your teamwork is,\nif your captain is a coward who'd rather pass,\nthan face me man to man.
It's over! You're done.
I'm not afraid of you! Has no one informed you\nthat soccer is a team sport?
That may be true. And passing is fundamental to\nthe game. One must trust one's teammates.
But if you're always relying on your teammates,\nthat just shows you have no faith in your own\nskill!
Wha--?!
Now, with Ishida in control of the ball\nand on the attack, will Takei get yet\nanother chance to score?!
If Minamiuwa takes another point,\nthe game's as good as done!
Everyone, keep an eye on Takei!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
I'm the one you should be watching! Take this!
Łoł! Ishida is making a long shot through a gap\nin Furano's defense!
Oh, no!
Not today!
What?!
H-He caught it!\nKato makes the save for Furano!
Over here, Kato!\nFurano's not losing to these chumps!
Right, Captain!
Here we go, you guys!
Follow the Captain!
Oooh!
Wooow!
Oooh!
Oooh!
Oooh!
Oooh!
Wh-What is this?!\nFurano's going on the offensive\nwith the whole team!
Okay, we just gotta stuff Furano's passing game\nlike always! Block the lines!
You... We train on a dirt field all year round,\nand you think you can beat us?!
Oh my! Without passing once, Matsuyama takes\na long shot!
What?!
Aaand it's in! It looked like a Hail Mary play,\nbut Matsuyama's shot just flew into\nMinamiuwa's goal with terrifying force!
Furano's all-out offense was just a feint to get\nMinamiuwa to focus on their passes,\nand it certainly paid off!
You did it, Captain!
There's still game to go!
Now, with the score tied, Furano MS is riding\na wave of energy with another all-out offense!
Matsuyama has the ball! What will he do?!
He's gonna take another shot!\nMark Matsuyama!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Here, Kaneda!
What?!
A surprise from Matsuyama!\nUnlike last time, he's passing the ball off!\nThis is the classic Furano offense!
Just stay calm guys!\nRead their passes and cut their lines!\nBe where the ball will be.
Tak!
Even Minamiuwa's Takei is falling back to defend!
Here, here! Got it!
What skill!\nTakei intercepts the pass!
I'm clear!
Oh no, you're not!
What the--?!
Th-This is amazing! Furano shifted to defend\nas soon as they lost the ball!\nThey've seamlessly combined offense and defense!
Captain!
And they pass it off to Matsuyama once again!
But Ishida seems to have predicted this,\nand is charging toward\nthe ball!
(I knew it!\nNo matter how good your teamwork is,\nin the end you rely on Matsuyama!)
Matsuyama!\nI think you need a break,\nand it's time I took a turn!
Ishida!\nIt's just you and me now!\nRemember, this is what you wanted!
B-But--!
Ishida lost?!
Matsuyama's slipped past Ishida!\nThe showdown between the two captains,\nfinds Matsuyama coming out on top!
Matsuyama is clear!\nIt's his chance for the decisive play!
Hyah!
But he doesn't take the shot!\nIt's another pass!
I love it when ya get poetic, Captain!
It's all on you, Oda!\nYou're the center forward!
(I already missed two shots today...)
(If I don't bring this one home,\nI can't hold my head high as a player!)
Here it goes!
And he did it!\nThird time's the charm for Oda!\nFurano sinks the game-winning goal!
And that's game!\nIt was definitely a battle, but Furano\nadvances to the semi-finals!
I-I did it!
Nice one, Oda!
Oh, Matsuyama! Thank goodness!\nMy heart was in my throat!
(So you won, Matsuyama.)
(But you gave Oda the game-winning shot.\nWhen you could've easily,\nput it in, yourself.)
(If he screwed it up, that'd be a mistake you\ncould never make up for. But even so, you passed\nit to him, knowing he'd already missed twice.)
(How deep does your trust truly run, Matsuyama?)
Okay, today's opponent is Hirado MS. So far,\nthey've won every game one to nil.
They've got a tight defense, but I know our\noffense can break it. Just keep your heads\nin the game, and never surrender!
Racja!
Racja!
Thank you!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
(So, Hirado MS...)
(I heard they came to scout us out\nduring the qualifiers.)
(They're new to Nationals, and I can't say they\nreally strike me as especially talented. But\nthere's a lesson to be learned from Minamiuwa MS.)
(They're the dark horse in this tournament,\nplaying all their cards close to the chest...)
(Wouldn't be surprised if they've\nsaved a few tricks for us.)
The day's finally arrived.
Yeah...\nThe fight we've been waiting for...Nankatsu.
Yep. The only one I'm here for.\nEverythin' else is jus' secondary.
Time ta show 'em what real soccer looks like!
The National MS Soccer Tournament is approaching\nits final stage, with three of the top four teams\nalready decided!
Competing for that final spot is last year's\nchamp, currently working toward a historic\ntriple victory, Nankatsu Middle School!
Now the clash, with the team that's\nscraped by winning every game one to none,\nHirado Middle School!
I'm sure we're all excited to see just how far\nthese Hirado challengers can push our reigning\nchampions!
End o' the road, Nankatsu!
What did you say?
We'll see about that.
Whadda y'know, if it ain't Nankatsu's captain,\nthe legendary Tsubasa Ozora.
Well, let's jus' say we came to win.
Fair enough.
(I bet most of the crowd\nis sure they'll win, too.)
(Well, that's too bad.\nCuz we're gonna hafta disappoint them!)
(That smug smirk...)
(I knew it, Hirado's got something planned...\nA trick they've been saving.)
Let's get this show on the\nroad!
We're playing for real today!
You betcha! Time to cut loose!
What are you even talking\nabout?
Stay sharp, everyone!
I've sure they've got\nsomething planned!
Here! Have a present!
Gah ha ha! Ya see that?\nThat's me and Sano's combo!
Simple and elegant.\nIf only y'could see your dumb faces!
You--!
The clock just started ticking!\nWe take back what's taken!
(Heh. Ya ain't seen nothin' yet.)
Not happenin'!
Ngh!
Go home, small fry!
Waaah!
This is it!
Get a taste of my Power Defense!
Gah!
Ngh...my shoulder...!
Jus' try and stop me!
Witness real skill!
Heh.\nGuess it's time for me to get\nserious too.
No points for you!
It's over!
Graaah!
Oof!
Tsubasa put everything into that shot,\nbut it hit the post! What awful luck!
I can't keep playing this way.\nMy form was off because I was trying to protect my\nshoulder from Jito's tackle.
Gaaah!
Heh.
I'm countin' on you, Nankatsu.
If you guys don't show me a lil backbone, then\nwhy the heck did I come all the way from Kyushu?
Gah ha ha!
I'll show you something, Jito!
Chew on this!
And that's the whistle for halftime!
How do you like that, folks!\nNankatsu's offense breaks through Hirado's tight\ndefense to take the lead at the end of the half!
And that's the whistle for halftime!
The battle between Nankatsu and Hirado\nhas been evenly matched in the first half!
It'll all come down to the second half!
And that's the whistle for halftime!
What a dark horse we're seeing today, folks!\nWho'd have thought Hirado would have such a lead\nover Nankatsu their first time at Nationals?!
Can Nankatsu's Tsubasa break through\nJito's sticky defense in the second half?!
Tsubasa! How's your shoulder holding up?
I'll manage... For now anyway.
Okay, but know your limits.
After we win today, we've got another\ngame to play tomorrow, and we're\ngonna need you all the way!
Right.
(But Hirado didn't just catch us off guard.\nThey have the chops to take the championship.)
(For now I need to focus on scoring goals because\nthere's no way of knowing what the second half \nwill bring.)
(Plus, there's so much more waiting for me down\nthe road!)
(Alright! My leg and my shoulder should hold up\nfor now.)
Izawa! Pass it to me as soon as you hear that\nwhistle!
Gotcha, Captain!
(Hang on to your hats, Hirado!)
(I think it's time you got a little taste of my\nDrive Shot!)
Man, Nankatsu's tough. It's like they're kicking\nrocks at us.
Hmph.
Captain?
That's what I've been waitin' for, Sano.
Don' matter if it's a fight or somethin' else.\nThe tougher the opponent, the sweeter the victory.
Captain, what are you--?!
I ain't felt this kinda fire in my gullet\nfor ages. Let's show 'em jus' what\nwe're about!
I-It's no use, I just can't beat Jito...
Tsubasa!
Get ahold of yourself, Tsubasa!
I'm sorry, Wakabayashi.\nLooks like a third championship was just\ntoo much to ask.
Sorry, Misaki. If only you were here,\nthings would never have gone this way.
Sorry, Roberto. I guess at the end of the day I'm\nnot going to win after all.
Snap out of it, Tsubasa!
What's gotten into you, Tsubasa?!
Tsubasa!
What's going...? Wakabayashi? Misaki? Roberto?!
Since when are you such a wimp?\nIt's still just the first half!
Giving up so soon, Tsubasa?
What he said!
Even without me, you've still got your teammates,\ndon't you? Work with them and get it done.
You guys...
Don't give up, Tsubasa!
You still have the Drive Shot!
My final lesson... The stuff of miracles...\nThe Drive Shot.
Roberto...
Are you awake there, Tsubasa?
Doc...
Hirado's one tough cookie. I guess he could get\neven you to consider throwing in the towel.
No. I'm not giving up. Not yet. Not while I can\nstill play.
I just need someone to help me pull off a combo\nplay.
Then, there'll be an opening for the Drive Shot.
I still haven't given the Drive Shot a chance yet\nthis game.
Heh.
Well, your treatment's done, so why\ndon't you head over to the bench?\nYour friends are waiting for you.
Racja!
Jeez, these guys are good.
And with Tsubasa injured...
Don't give up, you guys! This was only\nthe first half!
S-Sure, but...
What's the matter, you two?
Just a few scratches.\nWe'll be fine for the second half.
But Tsubasa, you...
Jito might be even better than Hyuga.
Plus he and Sano are tearing it up together.\nHow are we supposed to stop them?
Tsubasa! Time to get back on the field!
C'mon guys, let's do this! We got a game to win!
Tsubasa...
We're Nankatsu! We just need to keep playing our\nway. We'll get our chance! Never give up!\nNever surrender!
Yeah, I guess you're right. Nothing\nto do but make it happen.
No use worrying about the goals they already got.
We just gotta go for it!
(All it took was a smile from Tsubasa, and\neveryone is ready to roll again.)
(As always, injured or not, the team's hopes are\nresting on his shoulders.)
(It's not over yet. We can still make a comeback.)
(I still haven't tried the Drive Shot.)
(And as long as we have that...!)
Izawa! Pass it to me as soon as you hear that\nwhistle! I'll get us a goal.
Sure, thanks for letting me know.
(Hang on to your hats, Hirado!)
(I think it's time you got a little taste of my\nDrive Shot!)
We did it, Captain! Now, we just have to keep the\npressure on!
Yeah. Keep the pace. Keep them chasing us!
Racja!
(Bleh. This ain't no fun.)
(Takin' the kid gloves off for you Nankatsu.\nAnd that goes double for you, Tsubasa Ozora.)
(If this's all ya got, then soccer's just not\nchallengin' enough anymore.)
(Am I jus' the best there is? Can no one match my\nmettle with fists or feet?)
The whistle's about to blow, folks!
Will Nankatsu MS manage to hold on? Or\nwill Hirado show us a fresh tenacity?
Everyone's eyes are on the pitch as the second\nhalf begins. And there's Nankatsu with the\nkickoff!
The whistle's about to blow, folks!
Both teams are evenly matched! Will this showdown\nbetween Nankatsu's Tsubasa and Hirado's Jito\ndecide who's the best, once and for all?
Everyone's eyes are on the pitch as the second\nhalf begins. And there's Nankatsu with the\nkickoff!
The whistle's about to blow, folks!
Nankatsu can't afford to lose here if they want a\nthird championship!\nBut how will Tsubasa shake Jito's coverage?
Everyone's eyes are on the pitch as the second\nhalf begins. And there's Nankatsu with the\nkickoff!
(Here I go, Roberto. My Drive Shot.)
Take off!
Hah. Looks like he's all outta aces.
Don' matter how strong your kick is,\nif it ain't hittin' the goal.
Wh-What?!
It went in!
You did it, Tsubasa!
He really pulled it off!
An amazing play by Tsubasa!
That shot looked like it was going over the top\npost, but the spin dropped it straight in!
I can't believe this is a middle schooler!\nTsubasa Ozora, folks!
Even in this sorry state, I\npulled it off!
I can't believe this!
My turn! Drive Shot!
Gah!
(But it's not over yet!\nI'll keep sinking shots until we win!)
Yeeeah!
Graaah!
I-I lost.
In the battle between two relentless aces,\nTsubasa comes out ahead!
One fearsome shot after another...\nTsubasa's Drive Shot is a wonder to behold!
(Thank you, Roberto.\nThe Drive Shot you taught me is unstoppable!)
Ugh!
Sorry, guys...
Tsubasa...
I guess I must look pretty weak-hearted.
Collapsing in front of you, over and over again.
Hey man, nobody thinks that.
Catch your breath. We'll keep\n'em from scoring any more.
...Okay, thanks.
It's on, Nankatsu! Now that the warm-up is over,\nlet's get to the real game!
(Sano...)
So ya got a Drive Shot off twice...
I've taken a lot of licks in my time,\nbut that was somethin' else.
(It's no good, I can't put any\nstrength into it.)
(My body is done.)
All outta juice, Tsubasa?!
(Tsubasa! You aren't alone! Your team is here for\nyou!)
(Roberto!)
(Kisugi! Taki! I'm counting on you two!)
You can count on your\nforwards!
We're doing this!
Witness me! I am Teppei Kisugi, former scoremonger\nof Shutetsu, but now I score goals for Nankatsu!
You did it, you two!
Even if we don't match the Tsubasa and Misaki\nGolden Duo.
We can at least shine like silver!
We can at least shine like silver!
Just give us the chance, and we'll give the crowd\nsomething to cheer for!
I'll never be able to thank you enough!
And at long last, there's the final whistle!
Nankatsu wins, taking their place in the final\nfour for the third year in a row!
We won...
Alright!
We won, Tsubasa!
Uh huh...
Unbelievable!
I don' even remember the last time I lost.
(S'frustrating, but there's something else.\nS'almost... refreshin'.)
Get up, Sano.
Captain!
Don't cry. For you, there's always next year.
When the time comes again, I expect ya ta win.
...
I-I will.
So we lost. Let's clear the field and let them\ncelebrate.
(Tsubasa Ozora...)
(I figured I'd only play for a year, but I can't\nbe quittin' with the stink of defeat fresh on my\nrecord, now, can I?)
And at long last, there's the final whistle!
After sixty minutes of fierce competition, the \nbattle between Nankatsu and Hirado still isn't \nover!
It all comes down to a penalty shootout!
A shootout? Ugh.
You get some rest, it's my turn.
Morisaki...
I'm the keeper. This is what I do.
A penalty shootout means you're up\nagainst the goalie, one-on-one.
Heh. It's high noon now, buckos! Get ready to\nlose!
Racja!
And Nankatsu manages to slip ahead\nof Hirado in the penalty shootout!
If they can put together two more wins,\nthey'll be taking home their third\nsequential championship title!
And Nankatsu falls to Hirado in the penalty\nshootout!
Newcomer Hirado put the pressure on Nankatsu,\nand came away with the upset of the decade!
And at long last, there's the final whistle!
Nankatsu's fight for their third title is cut\nshort by the deadly and new Hirado from Kyushu!

We've finally made it to the finals of the\nShizuoka regionals. We'll be up against Otomo,\nand they've just been getting better and better.
They're led by Captain Urabe, who was Tsubasa's\nteammate back in elementary school. Seems like\nhe's been training just to take on Nankatsu!
He's one of the Otomo Quartet with three other\nfamiliar faces: Kishida, Nishio, and Nakayama. No\none could get past their defense in the prelims.
That leaves their 2nd year striker, Nitta,\nfree to shoot on the goal. We'll need to watch\nout for his speed and his special Falcon Shot.
We'll have to figure out in-game how to slip\npast the Otomo Quartet or upset Nitta's offense.
If we win this one we can finally\nmove on to Nationals, so good luck!
At long last, Nationals... Our first\nopponent is Azumaichi, representing Osaka.
They're an incredibly defensive team that didn't\ngive up a single point in Osaka regionals. That\nmeans every goal is even more important here.
We should definitely keep an eye on the defender,\nSoda. I hear they call him the Ace Killer because\nhe likes to target other teams' aces.
He'll probably mark Tsubasa,\nso be careful out there, alright?
I also hear he scored the winning goal at the\nOsaka finals, so there's a chance he could\njoin in on the offense, too.
I'm sure we're all nervous because this is the\nfirst game of Nationals, but it's also the first\nstep toward our third championship victory!
Our next opponent is Hanawa.\nWe played against them at Nationals back\nin elementary school, too, remember?
We need to watch out for two players: Masao and\nKazuo Tachibana. The twins' skilled coordination\nand acrobatic soccer will undoubtedly be strong.
This'll probably be a tough game where we'll need\nto keep them from controlling the match with\ntheir aerial soccer.
The most important thing is to not let the\nTachibanas get the ball, but if they do we'll\nneed to be extra careful.
It might be a good idea to keep one of them\nmarked at all times so they can't coordinate!
This won't be easy, but our opponents\nmust be feeling the pressure, as well.\nGather your courage and face them!
We made it to the quarterfinals... Next up is\nHirado. There are all sorts of rumors about this\nteam, but I don't know the truth about them.
All I can say for sure is that they haven't\ngiven up a goal in any match so far.\nThere's no doubt they have a strong defense.
One defender that stands out is Jito.\nHe's so big that it's hard to imagine\nhe's really a middle school student.
But I'm sure Tsubasa will be just fine,\neven if they've prepared for him! Good luck!
We finally made it to the semifinals!\nOur opponent is Furano MS from Hokkaido.
Most of the 3rd years in Furano have been\nplaying together since elementary school. I hear\nthey have the best teamwork in the tournament.
And at the heart of it is their captain,\nMatsuyama. His ability to hold onto possession\nof a ball is second to none.
We should watch out for the ground-crawling\nlong shot he used in the quarterfinals, too.
Don't let them run circles around us with their\ncoordination. Let's show them that Nankatsu is\nno slouch!
Once we win this, we'll be up against\nHyuga's Toho Academy in the finals! Good luck!
It's finally here... the National finals. And our\n3rd consecutive finals match with Toho Academy!
They may be the best they've ever been. Toho made\nit this far without relying on their ace Hyuga\nthis time. We can't afford to let our guard down.
Speaking of which, this will be the first match of\nthe tournament for Hyuga, their forward. Rumor has\nit he's been doing secret training! Be cautious.
Plus their goalie, Wakashimazu, is the best in\nthe nation. His specialty is acrobatic saves that\nincrease his coverage.
Not only that, they have the experienced playmaker\nSawada, and Sorimachi, who's been their scorer\nwhile Hyuga's been away. They've a lot of talent.
In terms of total team strength, I'd say we're\nabout equal. It may turn into a bit of a brawl.
But we're so close to conquering our\n3rd championship! Just one more match!\nLet's give it all we've got!
Our first opponent in the\nJunior Hero League is Meiwa Higashi MS!
They're another school from the final four at\nNationals! I hear most of them have been playing\ntogether since Meiwa elem. They're a lot like us!
They specialize in the sliding plays they\ndeveloped at Meiwa FC! Those gave us a tough\ntime back in elementary school, so watch out!
On offense, I think we need to watch out for\nSawaki. Most of the passes sent to the front\nlines are intended for him to make a play.
And the one sending him those balls is Narita!\nDon't underestimate him! Along with being a Meiwa\nveteran, he rose to captain on his own merits.
If we want a perfect championship,\nwe certainly can't lose in the first match!\nI'm sure you're nervous, but we can do this!
Our first opponent in the Junior Hero League is\nMinamiuwa middle! They're a tricky team in the top\neight. Good thing we have Captain's pass!
Back at Nationals, they were noted to strike\na good balance between offense and defense.
Ishida supports the front line from midfield\nby moving the ball effortlessly forward with his\noutstanding ball control.
Then, Takei frequently finishes\nthe job with his powerful headers.
They'll be keeping an eye on our captain's long\nshot this time. We'll be in trouble if we just\nkeeping passing it to him like before.
We just need to stick to the basics of Furano\nsoccer, and use our passing and dribbling\nto keep pushing forward with teamwork.
As long as we can get the ball up to me,\nI can make sure it scores! Trust me!
If we want a perfect championship,\nwe certainly can't lose in the first match!\nI'm sure you're nervous, but we can do this!
The second match of the Junior\nHero League is against Otomo MS!\nThis team likes to use a certain strategy.
Urabe and the others in the Otomo Quartet take\nover the midfield, where they steal the ball\nand send it ahead with a long pass!
Then Nitta takes the ball, zips into position,\nand seals the deal with his Falcon Shot! Watching\nfor this counterattack is our top priority!
Since we learn more towards defense, as well,\nour best bet is to keep Nitta pinned down with\ngood marking.
The Otomo Quartet may run a tight defense,\nbut they aren't unbreakable.
If we can get everyone to fall on the ball with an\navalanche attack, we'll definitely break through!\nWe should shatter Otomo's defenses together!
The second match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Hanawa MS! The Tachibana brothers' Skylab\nHurricane accounts for most of the team's goals.
If someone gets the ball and then they loft it\nto the front line, then you know that's what's\ncoming next.
One of the brothers will start sliding and then\nboost the other one up to shoot with a header.\nI was floored the first time I saw it.
But like I said, they need a long, high pass\nto set them up for their shot.
If the brothers head up field, quickly check\nwho has the ball, and keep them from making a\nlong pass!
We keep the brothers grounded, and we have\nnothing to fear! Let's show these guys what a\nreal duo looks like!
The third match of the Junior Hero\nLeague is against Azumaichi MS!
This team targets the weak point of their\nopponent's defense, secures the lead,\nand then goes all in on defense to maintain it.
Their strongest player is a defender called Soda.\nThey call him the Ace Killer, since he\nmarks opponents' aces and never lets up!
In this match he'll probably go after the captain,\nso we can't depend on the his power shots.
That said, since Soda will be concentrating\non the captain, that'll make it easier for the\nrest of us to move around.
This match is gonna test whether we can get the\nball moving and score without relying solely on\nthe captain. Is our teamwork for real or not?
You've gotta do your part to support the team!\nI expect a lot from you!
The third match of the Junior\nHero League is against Hirado MS!
This is a team that even cornered Nankatsu at\nNationals. Had Tsubasa not perfected his Drive\nShot, we may've faced them in the semifinals.
Their captain Jito, with his huge frame and power\nplays, is their greatest weapon. The midfield will\nbe tough to attack as they often place him there.
Sano, a second year, is another player to watch\nout for. He'll work with Jito to get goals,\nand his ability to keep the ball is top notch.
How you deal with the offense-defense combo\nof their two key players, Jito and Sano,\nwill determine the outcome against Hirado.
The fourth match of the Junior\nHero League is against Toho Academy!
Their forward Sorimachi, midfielder Sawada,\nand goalie Wakashimazu are all talented players.\nThe team doesn't have a particular weak point.
However, the real danger is their captain, Hyuga!\nHis Tiger Shot flies in a straight line\nat ludicrous speed and is very hard to stop.
Now, even though their members might be tougher\nindividually, our strength as a team is more\nthan a match for them!
If we attack as a team, defend as a team,\nand play the Furano way, we can go head-to-head\nwith any team!
They may be a monster team who went all the way at\nNationals, but if we get our teamwork right, we can\nwin this! Let's give it all we've got!
The fifth match of the Junior\nHero League is against Musashi MS!
They boast one of the highest scoring rates\nin the tournament sinking goal after goal using\ntheir offensive Top Trio formation.
It's all made possible by Misugi, the prodigy!\nHis dribbling, passing and shooting are perfect,\nand his calls pull together their precision plays.
However, due to an illness, he can only play the\nsecond half. One strategy is score a ton at the\nstart, and mark and stop him in the second half!
Misugi may be amazing, but there's no "I" in\nsoccer! Our teamwork can surpass even his\nprodigious talents! Let's show them how we do it!
All that's left is this match and then the one\nagainst Nankatsu! Let's kick our game into high\ngear and get our payback for Nationals!
The final match of the Junior\nHero League is against Nankatsu!\nThe team who bested us at Nationals.
In the midfield you have Izawa, a national ace,\nworking with Kisugi and Taki, making a formidable\noffense that's hard to defend against.
The one feeding them the ball is Tsubasa, arguably\nthe best player in the country. His dribbling,\npassing, and shooting are out of this world.
Defending, they've got the towering Takasugi, and\nIshizaki who's fiery plays can't be taken lightly.\nNankatsu's a seriously tough nut to crack.
Anyway, the one getting the ball at the most\ndecisive moments is gonna be Tsubasa! If we can\ndeal with him, we can bring 'em down.
We win this one, and we reach our goal of winning\nwith no losses! Let's pour all we have into this\nmatch! That means you, too! I'm counting on you!
The first match of the Junior Hero\nLeague is against Meiwa Higashi MS!
They were one of the top four teams at Nationals!\nMost of their members played together at Meiwa FC,\nnot unlike us and Musashi FC.
Their specialty is their Meiwa-style tackles!\nEven if you manage to evade 'em, they go\nright into their next attack! They don't let up.
Speaking of attacks, keep an eye on Sawaki.\nA lot of the balls that make it to their\nstrikers end up as goals thanks to him.
Narita tends to send it to Sawaki, who you need\nto remember was made captain over other Meiwa vets.
This is the first step to a win streak\nand facing Tsubasa! We can't lose! The first match\nis always nerve-wracking, but do your best!
The first match of the Junior Hero\nLeague is against Minamiuwa MS!
During Nationals, they were praised for striking\na solid balance between offense and defense.
Ishida, who's got excellent ball handling,\ncommands the midfield and can reliably deliver\nthe ball to his forwards.
When the ball is kicked to their offense, their\nforward Takei will try to score with a powerful\nheader!
Ishida is the key to their team! He never flubs\ndelivering the ball to Takei, and his teammates\ncount on him. Beat him and they crumble!
This is the first step to a win streak\nand facing Tsubasa! We can't lose! The first match\nis always nerve-wracking, but do your best!
The second match of the Junior\nHero League is against Otomo MS!\nThis team excels at a certain strategy.
Urabe and the others in the Otomo Quartet\ntake charge of the midfield, where they steal\nthe ball and send it ahead with a long pass.
Their speedy forward Nitta gets the ball and\nfinishes with a surefire Falcon Shot. Handling\nthis is tough, even when you know it's coming!
That said, I'm sure Musashi's offense has enough\npower to break through the Otomo Quartet's tight\ndefense.
Get the ball to the three guys up the field with\nsome good passes, and you'll have more chances to\nscore. More shots means more potential goals!
The second match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Hanawa MS! If nothing else, keep an eye on\nthe Tachibana brothers.
If someone gets the ball and then they loft it\nto the front line, that's the warning sign\nright there.
The Tachibana brothers need to work together to\nexecute the Skylab Hurricane. You'll need a lot of\nluck to stop that shot once it takes off.
But like I said, to make the move work,\nalong with the brothers nailing the jump,\nsomeone else has to send them a long pass.
Don't let the brothers get that long pass.\nIf their team gets the ball,\nget in there and take it back from them!
Musashi's offense surpasses Hanawa's,\nso you should be able to score more goals!\nPut on the offensive pressure and don't let up!
The third match of the Junior\nHero League is against Azumaichi!
This team targets the weak point of\ntheir opponent's defense, takes the lead,\nand then concentrates on defense to keep it.
Their strongest player is Soda, a defender.\nHe'll stick to the opposing ace and not let him\nget a good play in. They call him the Ace Killer.
In this match, he may go after the captain or any\nof the forwards. Be really careful about who you\npass to and when on offense.
That said, if Soda marks the captain, everyone\nelse will find it easier to make plays.
Draw Soda away and have everyone else shooting\naggressively to score goals as an opening emerges!
I'm certain Musashi's offense can break\nthrough that tough defense of theirs! Good luck!
The third match of the Junior\nHero League is against Hirado MS!
This is a team that put even Nankatsu in a corner.\nIf Tsubasa hadn't perfected his Drive Shot,\nNationals would've surely ended differently.
Their captain, Jito, is unbelievably strong for a\nmiddle schooler. His midfield defense is fierce,\nbut don't ignore his powerful dribble and shot.
Another key player is Sano, a 2nd-year forward.\nHe'll combo with Jito to get goals, but he's an\namazing dribbler, so it's tough to steal the ball.
Jito and Sano are key players\non both offense and defense.\nYou can't let them have free rein of the match.
If you can outplay their team-up,\nthen victory is all but certain! Good luck!
The fourth match of the Junior\nHero League is against Furano MS!
The Furano lineup has been mostly the same since\nelementary school. They make superb use of\ntheir teamwork to pull off some impressive plays.
Matsuyama, their captain, can hold onto the ball\nlike nobody's business, and he's got a knack for\nlong shots. He'll go for the goal from anywhere.
His skills outshine the rest of his team,\nso keep the ball away from him to give your\nteam room to breathe.
Coordination between captain and team will be key!\nBeat them at their own game with awesome teamwork!
The fifth match of the Junior Hero\nLeague is against Toho Academy!
They have big talent all over the field: forward\nSorimachi, midfielder Sawada, and their goalie\nWakashimazu. No real weak points to exploit here.
However, the real danger is their captain, Hyuga!\nHis Tiger Shot packs a wallop, and stopping\nit takes little less than a miracle.
Can't believe the captain's not here. But you're\nstill the team that backed him up this whole time.\nYou won't be outdone by Toho Academy!
They got us at the Tokyo Regional finals, but this\ntime we'll get them back! Do your best, everyone!
The final match of the Junior\nHero League is against Nankatsu MS!
This is it, everyone!\nThe match between the two undefeated teams!
Midfielder Izawa and forwards Kisugi and Taki\nbring the heat! The defense is stacked with\nTakasugi, Morisaki, and Ishizaki. No weaknesses.
Their captain, Tsubasa, is an excellent player all\naround and has fully recovered from his injuries.\nEven nationally, his skills are top tier.
But you've grown a lot in this tournament! I know\nyou can go kick for kick with Nankatsu!\nGood luck!
The first match of the Junior Hero\nLeague is against Meiwa Higashi MS!
They were one of the top four teams at Nationals!\nGave us a run for our money at the semifinals.\nMany of them are old teammates from Meiwa FC.
Their Meiwa-style slide tackle is as formidable\nas ever! Even when you evade it, they transition\nright into the next tackle, so be on your guard!
At the heart of their offense is Sawaki.\nPretty sure keeping him away from the ball\nwill make this a lot easier to win!
Narita sets up the ball for Sawaki, who is so good\nhe became captain over some of his veteran Meiwa\nteammates. Watch out for him.
Should we win, this will be our first step toward\na lossless championship. We have to win!\nLet's do it!
The first match of the Junior Hero\nLeague is against Minamiuwa MS!
They struck a solid balance between\noffense and defense during Nationals.
Ishida has a way of dominating the midfield\nand stealing the opponent's ball with his talent\nfor ball handling.
He'll then launch the ball on down the field,\nwhere the forward Takei scores with a powerful\nheader! They tend to get a lot of points this way.
Ishida's the high-speed train driving the team's\noffense. He holds the team together like glue,\nso if we can outplay him, victory is ours!
Should we win, this will be our first step toward\na lossless championship. We have to win!\nLet's do it!
The second match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Otomo MS! This team has a go-to strategy.
Urabe and the others in the Otomo Quartet\ntake charge of the midfield, where they steal\nthe ball and send it ahead with a long pass!
The speedy forward Nitta receives the ball,\nfollowing with a devastating Falcon Shot!\nDisrupting this strategy will be key.
Wakashimazu should be able to stop a Falcon Shot.\nAnd Hyuga's Tiger Shot can surely pierce the\nwall of the Otomo Quartet!
I'll be passing to our forwards a lot, too!\nWe've got nothing to fear!\nJust shoot like there's no tomorrow!
The second match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Hanawa MS! With this team, you gotta\nkeep an eye on the Tachibana brothers.
If someone gets the ball and then they loft it\nto the front line, that's the warning sign\nright there.
The Tachibana brothers combine their talents to\nproduce the Skylab Hurricane, a move so nuts\nonly they've managed to ever make it work.
But like I said, someone's gotta give them a long\npass for the brothers to create their unnatural\ndisaster.
Don't let the brothers get that long pass. If the\nopponent gets the ball, you steal it right back!
We keep that Skylab Hurricane grounded,\nand our skills will take care of the rest!\nLet's go out there and play like champs!
The third match of the Junior Hero\nLeague is against Azumaichi MS!
This team targets the weak point of their\nopponent's defense, nabs the lead, and then\ndoesn't let it go. Defense is their thing.
Definitely watch out for their defender Soda. His\nplay revolves around marking the opponent's ace\nand totally stopping him. Beware the Ace Killer.
He's for sure going to mark Hyuga.\nWe know what our Hyuga's capable of, but even he\nmight have a hard time using the Tiger Shot.
That said, Soda marking Hyuga means the rest of\nus will have a way easier time keeping the ball.
Toho Academy isn't a team that just leaves\neverything to Hyuga. If we stay on top of our\nshots, those goals are gonna happen!
We won the Nationals didn't we? We've got this.\nLet's just go for it, no fear!
The third match of the Junior\nHero League is against Hirado MS!
This is a team that cornered even Nankatsu\nat Nationals. If Tsubasa hadn't perfected his\nDrive Shot, Hirado would've been top dog.
Their captain, Jito, is a an absolute beast. He\nmight even outmatch Hyuga in terms of sheer power.\nAttacking his zone, the midfield, will be tough.
And watch out for the forward Sano. He teams up\nwith Jito to psych you out, and there's no\nstealing the ball from dribbling as good as his.
Jito and Sano are key players on both offense and\ndefense. We can't allow them any kind of freedom.
Anyway, Toho's a better team! We can pull\ntogether some sick plays with well placed passing\nto overwhelm them! Let's give it all we've got!
The fourth match of the Junior\nHero League is against Musashi MS!
The Top Trio, an offensive formation, is a goal\nmaking machine, giving their team one of the\nhighest scoring potentials in the tournament!
And Misugi makes it all possible! His dribbling,\npassing, and shooting are perfect, and his calls\nenable their precision plays. Watch him!
Outplaying Misugi is no simple task. I think we\nshould push up field using precise short passes\nto keep him from getting the ball.
Although, I'm pretty sure Hyuga's\npowerful dribbling could make it past Misugi.
We beat 'em once at the Tokyo Regional finals,\nbut you can never be too careful.\nWe know how to play to win so let's do it.
The fifth match of the Junior\nHero League is against Furano MS!
Their captain, Matsuyama, drives the\ncharacteristic teamwork they've been polishing\nsince their elementary school days.
Matsuyama's amazing at protecting the ball and\nobscenely good at long shots. Their arsenal also\nincludes the Avalanche Assault, which he commands.
Tighten up on defense, and be cautious of their\nteamwork and long shots. If you catch them pushing\nin, pushing right back might work well.
No matter the team, Toho's teamwork won't be\noutdone, and this will be the match to prove it!
The final match of the Junior\nHero League is against Nankatsu MS!
It's finally time for our rematch with\nNankatsu after tying during Nationals!
Izawa, Kisugi, and Taki make up a\nreally strong offensive formation,\nand have the strats to back it up.
You can't take their defense lightly either.\nIshizaki and Takasugi will be out there\nmaking plays and slinging Tiger Shots.
Also, Tsubasa recovered from his injury. The level\nhe plays at and the way he brings his team\ntogether are gonna be a major hurdle.
But we're a stronger Toho now. This time we will\nget that win! Let's put everything we have into\nthis game and beat Nankatsu!
The second scrimmage opponent is Germany. Their\nskills are top tier, even at the global level.
The front line especially is full of such top tier\nplayers. The average player's skill is not gonna\nbe enough to punch through that.
Schneider, their forward, can score from\noutside the penalty box, even against Wakabayashi.\nHe might be the most skilled striker in the world.
Other than him, there's the Craftsman, Kaltz;\nBremen's shot-caller Schester; and Margus with his\nsuper jumps. A talented lineup to say the least.
If I had to ascertain a weakness, it'd be their\ndefenders. Safely getting the ball to our scorers\nshould result in victory.
You can't hope to defeat them with old tricks.\nYou have to go at them with all your finest moves.
This is the last scrimmage before the tournament.\nYour opponent is South American powerhouse\nUruguay.
Typical of a South American team,\nthey have speed and technique to spare.
Their captain is Victorino, a forward. He's a\ndangerous striker and a good representation of the\nteam's playstyle. Keep an eye on him.
One thing you can do to combat speed is heighten\nyour defense. Don't leave any openings in your\nwake. Keep this in mind.
A new line up is being tested in this match. Try\nmany different plays and see if you can discover\nsome new strategies that could be effective later.
This is the last scrimmage before the tournament.\nYou'll be up against England,\nwho practically originated the sport.
Out of all the European teams, they use the sides\nheavily and rely on strong fundamentals. Not\nsurprising, coming from soccer's homeland.
Their captain, Robson, is a defender who uses his\nlarge frame to not only halt every ball but turn\nit into a counterattack. We want to avoid this.
Deal with a strong defender with quick, sure\npasses. If they lose their defensive formation,\nthe game is yours. Make plays with this in mind.
A new line up is being tested in this match. Try\nmany different plays and see if you can discover\nsome new strategies that could be effective later.
The first round's opponent is a team they're\nsaying is a real contender for the championship\ntitle: Italy.
They pride themselves on using a solid defensive\nstrategy known as catenaccio. The amount of goals\nscored on them is remarkably low.
They owe that impenetrability in large\npart to their goalie, Zino Hernandez.\nHe hasn't let in any goals in about a year.
If you want to figure out how to defeat a defense\nthat tight, you'll need to get in a formation\nwhere you can actively fire off shot after shot.
Attack thoughtlessly and you'll be prey for\ntheir forward, Rusciano. His combined power and\ntechnique make him the keystone of their offense.
Now, I've seen your scrimmages, and I'm convinced\nyou've got the skills to take on the world.\nGet out there and show 'em what you can do.
The second match is against the Netherlands,\nknown around the world for their tremendously\npowerful offense.
They have two main scorers who rack up points with\ntheir own styles: the calculating midfielder\nLensenblink and the imposing forward Kaiser.
Klismann usually gets them the ball\nfrom midfield. Both he and their\ndefender Dirk actively chase goals.
And the one who stands out the most\nout of all is the forward Brian Kluivoort.
His shots are so powerful, I'd say they're on par\nwith Schneider's. And that guy's one of the few\nwho can get past Wakabayashi.
If you're able to withstand this team's offense\nyour defense will be among the world's best. Be\nconfident in your skills and the rest will follow.
The final match of the prelims is against Senegal.\nThey run circles around their opponents with\ntheir speedy strategies.
Their fast forwards will dash past our defense,\nwhile their midfielders send a long ball their\nway. That's their basic strategy.
I'm not even sure if our fastest guy, Nitta, is a\nmatch for their players' speed. We'll want to\navoid playing into their rhythm.
And they have more than just speed. Senghor also\npitches balls up to their fleet-footed forward to\nmake plays on goal.
He's the answer to the question "what if a mad\nscientist played soccer?" You never know what he's\ngonna do when he gets the ball, so stay sharp.
Even if we can't win with speed, All-Japan has\nplenty of players who excel in other ways.\nWe play to our strengths. Got it?
Our opponent in the quarterfinals is Argentina.\nThe biggest threat on this team is, of course,\nJuan Diaz.
His unconventional soccer acrobatics fly in the\nface of common sense, and he's been able to score\nprofusely against the strongest teams worldwide.
He can pull off dynamic plays with\nthe help of his partner in crime, Pascal.
The key here will be how well the combo plays of\nour own aces, Tsubasa and Misaki, can compete with\ntheirs.
If we can keep Diaz and Pascal at bay,\nit'll give us the chance to score.\nWe can win this if you give it your all.
This is it. The semifinals.\nWe're up against France, who is favored\nto win the whole tournament.
At the forefront is Napoleon with his Cannon Shot,\nand in the back is Jean, the Shield of France.\nEvery player on that team is outstanding.
Elle Sid Pierre is their captain, holding the\nteam together. Since the tournament was cancelled\nin France, he's become even more formidable.
Their style is very similar to ours.\nWe have Hyuga at the front, Tsubasa in the\nmidfield, and Matsuyama in the back.
In a battle of similar styles, our differences\nwill define the outcome. Keep your head in the\ngame, and make every moment count.
We're in the finals. We play Germany.
You might remember from our scrim with them that\nthey've got a talented frontline. Their forward\nSchneider may as well be charging us with a sword.
He can score a goal against Wakabayashi from\noutside the penalty box, and his shot has only\ngotten fiercer throughout the tournament.
Keep the ball away from him, and keep firing shots\nat Muller, until you turn his defenses to shreds.
To do that, we have to surgically cut past their\nthree midfielders, who have all proven their\nprowess in this tournament.
Heine, who sends perfect passes to Schneider,\nSchester with superior offense and technique,\nand Kaltz, the playmaker.
Controlling midfield will be a monumental task,\nbut we've got no chance of winning without that\nstrategic control of the field.
We're in the finals. We're playing Brazil.
The kings of soccer have Alberto on defense and\nKeizinho in goal. Scoring on them will be about\nas easy as composing a concerto.
On offense, Carlos has proven to be a top player,\nwho can move the ball up the field and shoots\nlike he has rocket fuel in his cleats.
He used to be focused on just his own playstyle,\nweakening them as a team, but they showed skilled,\ncooperative passing in the semifinals.
But Leo is in the midfield as opposed to his usual\nposition. We can leverage his inexperience.
Psych yourself up however you can, and show\nthe world who the true kings of soccer are.
We're in the finals. We're facing America.
They beat tournament favorites Germany and Brazil.\nWithout a doubt, they will be the toughest foe\nwe'll face.
Their ace is Ryan in midfield. His soccer sense\nhelps the team operate like a well-oiled machine.
Other threats include their power striker Blake\nand the goalkeeper Azwan. They make Ryan's\ncallouts a reality on the pitch.
They may have served us in a scrimmage, but don't\nlet that cloud your concentration. We've earned\nour right to be here as their equals.
Let's try to not repeat our last performance\nagainst them. I want you to enjoy the match,\nand winning would be the surest way to do that!
The first match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Meiwa Higashi MS!
It was one of the top four schools at Nationals!\nIt's a team made up a lot of players from Meiwa\nFC, who we played back in our Nankatsu SC days.
They specialize in the sliding plays they\ndeveloped at Meiwa FC! Even Tsubasa had a tough\ntime with that so watch out!
On offense, I think we need to watch out for\nSawaki. Most of the passes sent to the front lines\nare intended for him to make a play.
And the one sending him those balls is Narita!\nDon't underestimate him! Along with being a Meiwa\nveteran, he rose to captain on his own merits.
Every team in the league matches is tough as\nnails. I'm sure you're nervous, but we can\ndo this!
The first match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Minamiuwa MS! They got top 8 at Nationals\nand gave Furano MS a run for their money.
Back at Nationals, they were noted to strike\na good balance between offense and defense.
Ishida supports the front line from midfield\nby moving the ball forward effortlessly with his\noutstanding ball control.
Then, Takei frequently finishes the job with\nhis powerful headers.
If the ball keeps going to Takei, that's when\nthe Otomo Quartet has to step in and work together\nto steal it!
Then, if we can send it to Nitta in the front\nline, he'd definitely get some points in.\nLet's keep pressing the attack!
Every team in the league matches is tough as\nnails. I'm sure you're nervous, but we can\ndo this!
The second match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Hanawa MS! The Tachibana brothers' Skylab\nHurricane accounts for most of the team's goals.
If someone gets the ball and then they loft it\nto the front line, that's the warning sign\nright there.
One of the brothers will start sliding and then\nboost the other one up to shoot with a header.\nEveryone was floored the first time we saw it.
But like I said, they need a long, high pass\nto set them up for their shot.
If the brothers head up field, quickly check who\nhas the ball, and keep them from making\na long pass!
If you steal the ball there's our big chance!\nWe make a long pass and then score!
The second match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Musashi MS!
They boast one of the highest scoring rates in\nthe tournament sinking goal after goal using their\noffensive Top Trio formation.
It's all made possible by Misugi, the prodigy!\nHis dribbling, passing and shooting are perfect,\nand his calls pull together their precision plays.
Despite his condition, he's polished his brisk\nplays since that tough match three years ago.\nWe gotta score in the first half while he's out.
But hey, we've been improving since elementary\nschool, too. The Otomo Quartet's gonna steal\nthe ball, even from him!
The third match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Azumaichi MS!
This team targets the weak point of their\nopponent's defense, secures the lead, and then\ngoes all in on defense to maintain it.
Their strongest player is a defender called Soda.\nThey call him the Ace Killer, since he marks\nopponents' aces and never lets up!
In this match, Nitta will probably get marked.\nI doubt we can win if we leave the offense to him.\nWe may not be able to score a lot.
But our defense is rock solid. We're not gonna\ngive them any ins! This is where the Otomo Quartet\nis gonna shine!
Then we just patiently wait for a chance to shoot!\nIn a match where scoring just one point gives you\na chance at victory, timing attacks is everything.
The third match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Hirado MS!
This is a team that cornered even Nankatsu\nat Nationals. Had Tsubasa not perfected his\nDrive Shot, who knows what would've happened.
Their captain Jito, with his huge frame and power\nplays, is their greatest weapon. The midfield will\nbe tough to attack as they often place him there.
Sano, a second year, is another player to watch\nout for. He'll work with Jito to get goals,\nand his ability to keep the ball is top notch.
How you deal with the offense-defense combo\nof their two key players, Jito and Sano,\nwill determine the outcome against Hirado!
The fourth match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Furano MS!
The Furano lineup has been mostly the same since\nelementary school. They make superb use of\ntheir teamwork to pull off some impressive plays.
Matsuyama, their captain, can hold onto the ball\nlike nobody's business, and he's got a knack for\nlong shots! He'll go for the goal from anywhere.
His skill is high above the team. Reminds me\nof facing off with Tsubasa during Regionals.\nThis time, we'll steal the ball for sure!
Also, Nitta's no-trap Falcon Shot shouldn't\nbe outdone by Matsuyama's long shots. If it comes\ndown to our aces, we still win!
The fifth match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Toho Academy!
Their forward Sorimachi, midfielder Sawada,\nand goalie Wakashimazu are all talented players.\nThe team doesn't have a particular weak point.
However, the real danger is their captain, Hyuga!\nHis Tiger Shot flies in a straight line\nat ludicrous speed and is very hard to stop.
This is gonna be a tough one... But Sawada knows\nwhat Nitta's capable of. They're gonna be more\ncautious of him than in previous matches.
They're the perfect opponent to try out our new\nattack pattern. We'll beat 'em and face\nNankatsu undefeated!
The final match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Nankatsu MS! We finally get our rematch.\nI'm pumped!
In the midfield you have Izawa, a national ace,\nworking with Kisugi and Taki, making a\nformidable offense that's hard to defend against.
The one feeding them the ball is Tsubasa, arguably\nthe best player in the country. His dribbling,\npassing, and shooting are out of this world.
Defending, they've got the towering Takasugi,\nand Ishizaki whose fiery plays are scary, for\nreal. Nankatsu's a seriously tough nut to crack.
Anyway, the one getting the ball at the most\ndecisive moments will ultimately be Tsubasa! If we\ncan get the ball from him, we can take 'em down!
We've been waiting for this—our chance to defeat\nNankatsu! Let's have ourselves a match\nto remember and bring down the giant!
The first match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Meiwa Higashi MS!
It was one of the top four schools at Nationals!\nIt's a team made up of players from Meiwa FC,\nwho we played back in our elementary days.
They specialize in the sliding plays they\ndeveloped at Meiwa FC. Even Tsubasa had a tough\ntime with that so watch out!
On offense, I think we need to watch out for\nSawaki. Most of the passes sent to the front lines\nare intended for him to make a play.
And the one sending him those balls is Narita.\nDon't underestimate him! Along with being a Meiwa\nveteran, he rose to captain on his own merits.
Every team in the league matches is tough as\nnails. But we can hold our own even without\nTsubasa! Come on, guys!
The first match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Minamiuwa MS! They got top 8 at Nationals\nand gave Furano MS a run for their money.
Back at Nationals, they were noted to strike\na good balance between offense and defense.
Ishida supports the front line from midfield\nby moving the ball forward effortlessly with his\noutstanding ball control.
Then, Takei frequently finishes the job with\nhis powerful headers.
But Takasugi's great at midair toss ups!\nI'm sure he'd win even against Takei!
Once we have the ball, the Shutetsu Trio will take\ncare of the rest. They'll advance the ball and\nscore to secure the win!
Every team in the league matches is tough as\nnails. But we can hold our own even without\nTsubasa! Come on, guys!
The second match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Hanawa MS! The Tachibana brothers' Skylab\nHurricane accounts for most of the team's goals.
If someone gets the ball and then they loft it\nto the front line, that's the warning sign\nright there.
One of the brothers will start sliding and then\nboost the other one up to shoot with a header.\nIt's a mystery how they pull that off.
But like I said, they need a long, high pass\nto set them up for their shot.
If the brothers head up field, quickly check who\nhas the ball, and keep them from making\na long pass!
Midair toss ups will be a bit tough without\nTsubasa, but if we can put a thorn in the\nopponent's advantages, we can come out ahead!
The second match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Otomo MS! This team has a go-to playstyle.
Urabe and the others in the Otomo Quartet take\nover the midfield, where they steal the ball\nand send it ahead with a long pass!
Their speedy forward Nitta gets the ball and\nfinishes with a surefire Falcon Shot. It's a\nsimple strategy, but it's tough to deal with!
Tsubasa marked Nitta in the Shizuoka Regionals\nand was able to deny him a chance to attack.\nIf we can do the same, we're sure to win!
Don't let winning get to your head, though. They\ndidn't come to lose. We can win as long as we play\nsmart and consistent.
The third match of the Junior Hero\nLeague is against Azumaichi MS!
This team targets the weak point of their\nopponent's defense, secures the lead, and then\ngoes all in on defense to maintain it.
Their strongest player is a defender called Soda.\nThey call him the Ace Killer, since he marks\nopponents' aces and never lets up!
In this match, he'll probably mark our playmaker\nIzawa, since Tsubasa isn't here. We'll have a hard\ntime getting the ball down field.
But if Soda sticks to him like cheese fondue, that\nmeans the rest of us can stretch our legs with\nless pressure. We storm the pitch together!
If we let them score first, it'll be a tough game\nof catch up, like our first game at Nationals.\nWe really need to get that first point!
The third match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Hirado MS!
This is a team that cornered us at Nationals.\nHad Tsubasa not perfected his Drive Shot,\nwe would've been up a river without a paddle.
Their captain Jito, with his huge frame and power\nplays, is their greatest weapon. The midfield will\nbe tough to attack as they often place him there.
Sano, a second year, is another to watch out for.\nHe and Jito will catch you off guard to get goals,\nand his ability to keep the ball is top notch.
How you deal with the offense/defense combo\nof their two key players, Jito and Sano,\nwill determine the outcome against Hirado!
The fourth match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Furano MS!
The Furano lineup has been mostly the same since\nelementary school. They make superb use of\ntheir teamwork to pull off some impressive plays.
Matsuyama, their captain, can hold onto the ball\nlike nobody's business, and he's got a knack for\nlong shots! He'll go for the goal from anywhere.
Once Matsuyama gets the ball, it'll be hard to\nsteal back. It'd be best to keep the ball away\nfrom Matsuyama at all times.
They gave the other team a hard time\nat the national semis.\nWe'll need to play our best to win.
The fifth match of the Junior\nHero League is against Musashi MS!
They boast one of the highest scoring rates in\nthe tournament sinking goal after goal using their\noffensive Top Trio formation.
It's all made possible by Misugi the prodigy!\nHis dribbling, passing, and shooting are perfect,\nand his calls unite them as a team.
Despite his condition, he's more polished since\nhis tough match against Nakatsu SC years ago.\nWe gotta score in the first half while he's out.
But we've had just as much time to make ourselves\nlethal! We'll show them how we've leveled up from\nour experience at Nationals!
The sixth match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Toho Academy!
Their forward Sorimachi, midfielder Sawada,\nand goalie Wakashimazu are all talented players.\nThe team doesn't have a particular weak point.
However, the real danger is their captain, Hyuga!\nHis Tiger Shot flies in a straight line\nat ludicrous speed and is very hard to stop.
This match will be the hardest yet. We've gotten\nthis far on our own, and Tsubasa will be there\nwith us again. They should be terrified!
They are our fated rival, and worthy of being the\nfinal hurdle we face. Let's destroy them and win\nthis thing with our record unblemished!
The first match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Meiwa Higashi MS!
One of the top four schools at Nationals!\nIt's made up of players from Meiwa FC, who played\nagainst the Tachibanas in elementary school.
They specialize in the slides drilled into them\nat Meiwa FC! They'll aim for anyone centering,\nso it'll be tough to get the ball in the air.
On offense, I think we need to watch out for\nSawaki. Most of the passes sent up front are\nintended for him to make a play.
And the one sending him those passes is Narita.\nDon't underestimate him! On top of being a Meiwa\nveteran, he rose to captain on his own merits.
There are no weak teams in this league,\nbut let's show 'em the power of Aerial Soccer!\nI'll keep the passes comin'!
The first match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Minamiuwa MS! They got top 8 at Nationals\nand gave Furano MS a run for their money.
Back at Nationals, they were noted to strike\na good balance between offense and defense.
Ishida supports the front line from midfield\nby moving the ball forward effortlessly with his\noutstanding ball control.
Then, Takei frequently finishes the job with\nhis powerful headers.
He'll be in the back lines a lot, so I might end\nup going head to head with him.
But getting that ball is my job. And once I pass\nit ahead, Ishida won't a chance against Masao and\nKazuo!
There are no weak teams in this league,\nbut let's show 'em the power of Aerial Soccer!\nI'll keep the passes comin'!
The second match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Otomo MS! This team has a go-to playstyle.
Urabe and the others in the Otomo Quartet take\nover the midfield, where they steal the ball\nand send it ahead with a long pass!
Their speedy forward Nitta gets the ball and\nfinishes with a surefire Falcon Shot. It's a\nsimple strategy, but it's tough to deal with!
I know this 'cuz I specialize in long passes,\nbut they take longer to set up than normal ones.\nYou might wanna use that time to steal the ball.
And once you do, send it to me! I'll kick it right\nup into a Skylab Hurricane for Masao and Kazuo!
The fourth match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Furano MS!
The Furano lineup has been mostly the same since\nelementary school. They make superb use of\ntheir teamwork to pull off some impressive plays.
Matsuyama, their captain, can hold onto the ball\nlike nobody's business, and he's got a knack for\nlong shots! He'll go for the goal from anywhere.
Once Matsuyama gets the ball, it'll be hard to\nsteal back. It'd be best to keep the ball away\nfrom Matsuyama at all times.
They've got strong legs from training in the\nHokkaido snow, so staying above their reach with\nKazuo and Masao is definitely important today.
Between our passwork and our aerial soccer,\nwe can't lose! Let's do what we do best!
The third match of the Junior Hero\nLeague is against Azumaichi MS!
This team targets the weak point of their\nopponent's defense, secures the lead, and then\ngoes all in on defense to maintain it.
Their strongest player is a defender called Soda.\nThey call him the Ace Killer, since he\nmarks opponents' aces and never lets up!
But we'll be in trouble if he marks Masao or\nKazuo, since we'll need 'em both to set up a\nSkylab Hurricane...
Still, he can't cover Soda at the same time.\nStay aware of which nearby players are open,\nand you can't go wrong!
As long as we take the initiative,\nwe can leave the offense to Masao and Kazuo.\nAnd with me on defense, this'll be a cake walk!
The third match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Hirado MS!
This is a team that cornered Nankatsu at\nNationals. They might've actually won,\nif Tsubasa hadn't perfected his Drive Shot.
Their captain Jito, with his huge frame and power\nplays, is their greatest weapon. The midfield will\nbe tough to attack as they often place him there.
Sano, a second year, is another to watch out for.\nHe and Jito will catch you off guard to get goals,\nand his ability to keep the ball is top notch.
How you deal with the offense and defense combo\nof their two key players, Jito and Sano,\nwill determine the outcome against Hirado!
The fifth match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Musashi MS!
They boast one of the highest overall point totals\nin the tournament, sinking goal after goal using\ntheir aggressive Top Trio formation.
It's all made possible by Misugi the prodigy!\nHis dribbling, passing, and shooting are perfect,\nand his calls unite them as a team.
And since it's hard to fight perfect, we'd better\nscore a lot in the first half before he shows up.
But we should be able to catch 'em off guard with\nyou and the Tachibanas' new Skylab Triangle!
I mean, I get that you only just got it down, but\nI'll make sure to get you the ball as often as I\ncan! We'll be counting on you!
The fifth match of the Junior Hero League\nis against Toho Academy!
Their forward Sorimachi, midfielder Sawada,\nand goalie Wakashimazu are all talented players.\nThe team doesn't have a particular weak point.
However, the real danger is their captain, Hyuga!\nHis Tiger Shot flies in a straight line\nat ludicrous speed and is very hard to stop.
I won't lie, this'll be a tough match. But between\nyou, Masao, Kazuo, and the Skylab Triangle,\nthere's no way we're losing this!
How do I know?\nI've seen how hard you've been practicing, duh!
The sixth match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Nankatsu MS!
In the midfield you have Izawa, a national ace,\nworking with Kisugi and Taki, making a\nformidable offense that's hard to defend against.
The one feeding them the ball is Tsubasa, arguably\nthe best player in the country. His dribbling,\npassing, and shooting are out of this world.
On defense, they've got tall Takasugi and the\nhot-blooded Ishizaki, who made the Triangle Shot\nobsolete. These guys'll be a tough nut to crack.
Anyway, the one getting the ball at the most\ndecisive moments will ultimately be Tsubasa! If we\ncan get the ball from him, we can take 'em down!
If we win this, we'll be the exhibition champions!\nThis may be our last chance to play with Kazuo and\nMasao, so let's make it count!
Round one of the Junior Hero League we got\nMeiwa Higashi MS to contend with!
They're a top four school from Nationals!\nThey're mostly Meiwa FC players, where Hyuga and a\ncouple others in Toho Academy are from.
Their go-to technique is Meiwa FC-style slidin'!\nThose sharp slides of theirs seem to cut everybody\ndown to size. 'Cept for me, of course.
On offense, ya gotta keep an eye on Sawaki.\nHis team pushes the ball forward to him,\nand he scores off their passes.
The one sendin' him those passes is Narita.\nHe's risen through the ranks fast to become\ncaptain, so ya know ya gotta watch 'im.
The league's gonna be a who's who of the top\nschools, but if we can play our best, we'll win\nfor sure. Let's show 'em how it's done!
First match of the Junior Hero League is with\nMinamiuwa MS! They got top eight, just like us,\nand they gave Furano MS a run for their money.
The chatter is that they balance offense and\ndefense well. They showed that back at Nationals.
Ishida supports the front line from midfield by\npushin' the ball forward any way he pleases.\nHis ball control lets him run rings around others.
Then, Takei comes in and finishes the job,\nusually with a solidly placed header.
Then again, with me at the back, I doubt\nthey'll get the ball up front all that often.\nStill, stay loose. Stay sharp!
When we steal the ball, we're good. Sano oughta\nbe able to score when I send it his way!\nDon't you be shy 'bout makin' plays, either!
The league's gonna be a who's who of the top\nschools, but if we can play our best, we'll win\nfor sure. Let's show 'em how it's done!
Round two of the Junior Hero League is against\nAzumaichi MS!
This team's a lot like us! They target the weak\npoint of their opponent's defense, get the lead,\nand hang onto it with everything they've got.
I guess their tough guy would be Soda on defense.\nThey call him the Ace Killer because he focuses on\nother teams' aces and takes them apart.
We all know I'm the ace up our sleeve,\nbut Sano's the one who's scored the most for us.\nWhichever of us he marks, it's gonna be a pain.
But I don't foresee too much trouble from the\nother players once we can knock some holes in\nthat defense. Outplaying him will be vital.
And hey, we're a defensive team, and we made it to\nNationals. If we take the lead first, the match is\npractically ours! Just don't get too comfy.
Round two of the Junior Hero League is against\nHanawa MS! The Tachibana brothers' Skylab\nHurricane is where most of their points come from.
If the ball gets lofted in the direction of\ntheir offense, that's when you should hear warning\nbells goin' off.
One of the brothers will start slidin' and then\nboost the other one up to shoot with a header.\nHeck of a gutsy move they got.
But like I said, they need another player to feed\nthem a long, high pass so they can do their\nbouncin' around.
If their team gets the ball, mark them pronto!\nThat oughta keep at least some long passes from\nthe twins!
Heh. They may have a powerful weapon, but if we\nlock it down, the match is in the bag!\nSo, come on. Zróbmy to!
The third match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Furano MS!
The Furano lineup hasn't changed much since\nelementary school. They make great use of their\nteamwork to pull off some banger plays.
Their cap, Matsuyama, is near impossible to steal\nthe ball off of, and his long shots make him a\nreal threat! He'll go for the goal from anywhere.
Once he gets the ball, it'll be like breaking into\nFort Knox to get it back. Let's keep any exchanges\nof the ball away from him!
Bein' from Nagasaki, it's hard to imagine what\ntraining in Hokkaido snows is like for them,\nbut seein' how they play, it must be rough.
You gotta admire their spirit, workin' on their\ngame while trudgin' through snowdrifts.\nLet's show them our Kyushu spirit burns as bright!
The third match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Musashi MS!
They boast one of the highest scorin' rates in\nthe tournament, sinkin' goal after goal with their\naggressive Top Trio formation.
It's all made possible by Misugi the prodigy!\nHe dribbles, passes, and shoots perfectly, and he\ncalls out the most precise plays.
And they say his strategy has been that good since\nelementary school. If we wanna score, it'll\nhave to be in the first half before he shows up.
That said, with soccer, you never know until you\ntry. If we can break through him, it'll give us\na huge chance, so keep hammerin' away!
The fourth match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Otomo MS! I know their default playstyle\nwell. Sano and I faced 'em on their own turf.
Urabe and the rest of the Otomo Quartet take\nover the midfield, where they steal the ball\nand send it ahead with a long pass!
Their speedy forward Nitta gets the ball and\nfinishes with a surefire Falcon Shot. It's a\nsimple strategy, but it's tough to guard against!
I've drilled passing long to Sano, and those\npasses take time to travel up the field.\nAnd that's when you gotta strike.
When you steal the ball, get it to me! We'll see\nwhat good their counterattack strategies are\nwhen I combo with Sano.
This match will be the debut for that shot you\nhelped Sano learn. They won't know what to do\nwith themselves!
The fifth match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Toho Academy!
Their forward Sorimachi, midfielder Sawada,\nand goalie Wakashimazu are all gifted players.\nI honestly couldn't identify a weak spot per se.
The real danger, though, is their captain, Hyuga!\nI couldn't fully stop his Tiger Shot. They say\nit's as strong as Tsubasa's Drive Shot.
This one's gonna be hard-won, I tell ya what.\nBut I've got a secret weapon I've been workin' on\njust for the occasion: these abs!
Sano's been drilling his sharp shot like crazy!\nAnd you've been improving a lot, too. This\nmatch'll be our chance to show 'em our progress!
The sixth match of the Junior Hero League is\nagainst Nankatsu MS! We finally fought our way up\nto the top!
With national ace Izawa in the midfield and\nKisugi and Taki's combos, it's a tough offense to\nguard against. They've even gotten my goat before.
The one feedin' them the ball is Tsubasa, arguably\nthe best player in the country. His dribblin',\npassin', and shootin' are all top tier weapons.
Then on defense they have that big guy, Takasugi,\nand Ishizaki, who makes some intense plays.\nNankatsu's a tough nut to crack, no doubt.
Course, their cap'n Tsubasa will have the ball\nat the most critical points. If we can beat him,\nthe game's ours for the takin'!
Winnin' this means fulfilling a long held dream of\nbeatin' Nankatsu! Play so as to have no regrets.\nLeave it all on the pitch!
Once, in a nondescript suburb of Tokyo,\nthere was a boy who loved soccer.
That boy's name was Tsubasa Ozora.
Crazy... The kid's happy just as long as\nhe has a soccer ball.
Wait, where's Tsubasa?
Tsubasa? He was just here...
Tsubasaaa!
Ten years later...
Tsubasaaa! Where are you?\nI need your help with something!
Mom! I'm going for a walk! I'll be back soon!
Tsubasa, now eleven, had moved to\nNankatsu City in Shizuoka.
It was a miracle.
I still can't believe that soccer ball cushioned\nhim from both the car crash AND the pavement!
He got up without so much as a scratch, but...
It seemed obvious he was born to play soccer!
From the Shutetsu Elementary soccer club, dominant\neven at the national level: Genzo Wakabayashi.
I can stop any shot from outside the penalty box!
And he could. He was a genius goalkeeper,\nwho could stop any ball.
Łoł! I've never seen such an amazing goalie!
Upon seeing Wakabayashi's talents with his own\neyes, Tsubasa issued him a formal challenge.
Fly!
Tsubasa's kick sent the ball all the way to Wakabayashi's house.
Wakabayashi's eyes fell on Tsubasa and the ball in flight.
You gotta be kidding me! How's a little squirt\nlike him putting so much power into his kicks?!
Though propelled at his face, Wakabayashi brought the\nball down like a pro. Tsubasa moved for a return...
...right as the bus...
Accept my challenge, Wakabayashi!
You're... Tsubasa Ozora?
And that's how the two young prodigies,\nTsubasa Ozora and Genzo Wakabayashi, first met.
If you expect to challenge me, you'll need to\nprove you can get through my team first! Alone!
His showdown with Wakabayashi on the line, Tsubasa stood before the\nentire Shutetsu Elementary soccer team, outnumbered eleven to one.
But with his magnificent skills,\nTsubasa made even that look easy.
Incredible! A kick underneath a moving bus!\nAnd that dribbling!
I can't believe a boy of his age can handle\nthe soccer ball so effortlessly well!
However, Tsubasa's header was deflected by\nWakabayashi and bounced off the goalpost.
And this led to the arrival\nof a certain man in his life.
The ball's still in play!
I know you! You're Roberto Hongo,\nthe forward from the Brazilian National Team!
It's not over! Let me center the ball for you!
And this was how the two young prodigies\nfirst clashed.
At the time, no one could have imagined the impact\nthese two would come to have on Japanese soccer.
A game! We'll have a game!
That's how I'll accept your challenge!
Tsubasa Ozora and Genzo Wakabayashi's duel\nwas settled in a match between their teams.
Shutetsu was led by Wakabayashi's Shutetsu\nQuartet: Takasugi the Center Back...
Izawa the Playmaker, Taki the King of Assists,\nand Kisugi the Scoremonger.
They were a fearsome team,\nnumber one in the nation.
For the first half of the game, neither Nankatsu Elementary\nnor Shutetsu Elementary managed to score.
Ten minutes into the second half, Shutetsu's\nKisugi took the first point from Nankatsu.
It's not over yet, Shutetsu!\nThis match is just beginning!
Tsubasa lived up to his word, tying up\nthe game with a last second overhead kick.
As the game moved into overtime,\nWakabayashi made a surprising declaration.
This match was always about whether Tsubasa\ncould score even a single goal against me.
Since he has, I've already lost.\nYou guys play overtime without me.
As Wakabayashi tried to withdraw, he received a\nbrow-beating from his personal coach, Mikami.
You should be ashamed, Genzo! You're\ngoing to desert your team over one point?!
Hearing those words, Wakabayashi was\nbrought back to his senses.
I may've lost my duel with Tsubasa, but I'm still\nthe captain of this team! We're going to win this!
And so the game continued into overtime.
Shutetsu scored the first point in overtime, but Tsubasa's indefatigable\nspirit pushed through, and he scored, tying the game again.
Tsubasa managed another header in the final 10\nseconds, but this time Wakabayashi caught it.
After the end of an intense overtime, the two\nprodigies concluded their match in a tie.
You got me, Tsubasa!
Not at all! We tied!
Tsubasa and the others were chosen to participate in the National Youth Soccer Tournament.
While practicing, Meiwa SC's Kojiro Hyuga\nappeared from nowhere and challenged Wakabayashi.
Hyuga steals the ball and heads straight for the goal!
Wakabayashi was unable to move a single muscle before the sturdy Hyuga took his shot!
Ha ha! That all you've got, Mr. Prodigy?!
Laughing at Wakabayashi, Hyuga turned to leave.
I can't believe it... Someone other than\nTsubasa can score on Wakabayashi?!
Is it... because of your injured leg?
Why didn't you try to stop his shot?
No, I'm not sure I could've stopped it even\nif I had tried. That kick was incredibly fierce.
And I'm not so pathetic as to use an injury\nas an excuse for getting beat.
We're definitely making it to Nationals,\nand Hyuga will, too. We'll get him back for this!
With that declaration, Wakabayashi led Nankatsu SC\nto the regional finals despite his injured leg.
And at those finals...
He managed to hold off Shimizu FC's ferocious\nassault even as his injury worsened.
Who do you think I am?! I'm Genzo Wakabayashi!
Stay laser-focused right to the end, Tsubasa!
Tsubasa! Settle it with your special volley shot!
Get in there!
We did it!
With Wakabayashi's grit and help from their ace\nstriker Tsubasa, Nankatsu SC won the Regionals.
They then moved on to Nationals.
Tsubasa and the team won the right to participate\nin the National Youth Soccer Tournament.
However, Captain Wakabayashi was staying behind\nin Nankatsu City to treat his injury.
Do me a favor, Tsubasa?
I won't be there, but I need you to keep winning.\nWin until we can face Kojiro Hyuga's Meiwa FC!
I still owe him for when he scored on me. By then\nI'll be back on my feet and ready to face him.
I'm counting on you, Tsubasa!
Along with this responsibility, Wakabayashi also\nentrusted Tsubasa with the role of captain.
We're going to be number one!
Under Tsubasa, as the new captain, Nankatsu SC\nprepared to battle it out at Nationals.
Ironically though, their first match was against Meiwa FC.
But how...? How could we have\ndrawn them for the first match?!
With Wakabayashi watching from the sideline, Tsubasa and the\nothers bravely took the field to wage war on Hyuga's Meiwa FC, but...
Nankatsu SC lost after a fierce game.
After the match, Tsubasa received\na call from Wakabayashi.
Don't worry! If we win our other four matches,\nwe'll still make it to finals!
I'm counting on you guys!\nI'll be there the instant my leg's better!
And as he'd promised, Tsubasa and the team won\none hard-fought victory after another.
Yet standing in their way in the semifinals was\nthe prodigy Jun Misugi and his team, Musashi FC.
We can't win... Misugi's just too good!
Even handicapped by a heart condition, Captain\nMisugi possessed inestimable technique and skill.
Faced with that, Tsubasa gave into despair\nand lost his drive to win.
But then...
Stand up, Tsubasa!
Are you going to let it end like this?!
Is this all Nankatsu's soccer amounts to?\nDoes soccer means so little to you, Tsubasa?!
You're the first person I considered a rival! No\nway he's better than you, even if you think so!
Wakabayashi began to cheer for his teammates,\nand Tsubasa rose to his feet.
You're right. We're not going out like this!
I hope you're watching closely, Wakabayashi!\nI'm about to take back this game!
With his fighting spirit restored, Tsubasa squared\noff against the soccer genius, Jun Misugi.
It's on!
Beneath a curtain of pouring rain,\nthe intense match proceeded.
Tsubasa fought to the very end, and with a goal right as the clock ran\nout Nankatsu SC turned their fortunes around, advancing to finals.
And at last, the finals...
Tsubasa's Nankatsu SC was facing Hyuga's Meiwa\nFC, who'd defeated them in their opening match.
I still owe you from before, Hyuga!\nI'm not going to lose this time! Not to you!
With his injury now healed, Wakabayashi,\nthe formidable goalkeeper, rejoined his team, and managed to stop all of Hyuga's shots.
What's going on?! This guy blocked\nthree of my shots in a row!
Burning with a desire to win, the Fierce Tiger Hyuga and\nhis teammates attacked with a heretofore unseen ferocity.
Until finally, amidst the pitched battle, Tsubasa and\nMisaki injured their legs, rattling the Nankatsu SC team.
At the same time, while Wakabayashi had been aiming for a perfect\ngame, Hyuga's tenacity finally paid off as he scored with a header.
Even worse, Wakabayashi's old injury suddenly\nflared up. The team faced their greatest crisis.
The intense struggle continued right up to the very last\nminute, and Meiwa FC was on the cusp of victory...
When suddenly Wakabayashi stepped out of the goal, stole\nthe ball from Hyuga, and charged right into Meiwa's territory.
I have to... I have to make up for\nletting Hyuga score those goals!
Wakabayashi put everything he had\ninto one last long shot.
And with an assist from Misaki,\nTsubasa buried the ball in the net.
The amazing display tied the score,\npushing the game into overtime. Still, Tsubasa, Misaki, and Wakabayashi were all injured.
With you guys hurt, scoring some\nmore goals should be a breeze!
At the start of overtime, Hyuga put\nall his strength into one super long shot.
I won't let you get a single point, Hyuga,\neven if my legs crumble to dust!
With that declaration, Wakabayashi continued to stand in the\nway of Meiwa's assault, and the game into its second overtime.
But after blocking so many shots,\nWakabayashi's leg was finally reaching its limit.
Hyuga's shot forced Wakabayashi to use just\nhis right leg to dive. He slammed into the dirt.
In trying to stop the ball,\nMisaki also ran full force into the goalpost.
With both his teammates injured, Tsubasa sprinted\ntoward Meiwa's goal fueled by the desire to win.
After getting the better of Hyuga and slipping past Wakashimazu\nthe Iron Wall, Tsubasa had created an opening for a goal.
And the ball sailed into the net.
When the whistle blew, Nankatsu SC had won\nthe National Youth Soccer Tournament.
Tsubasa, Wakabayashi, and the rest of the team\nreturned to Nankatsu City as champions.
But Roberto was headed to his home country.
And Misaki was leaving, too.
With their friends off on their own journeys,\nWakabayashi knew his choice of destination.
Tsubasa... I'm going to Germany!
His coach, Tatsuo Mikami, asked him to train in\nGermany to raise the level of Japanese soccer.
You wanna come to Germany with me?
G-Germany?!
Tsubasa... I heard you're going to Brazil,\nso I've been thinking about this a lot.
If we're going to be world-class players, we've\ngot to learn more about international soccer.
Germany's pro league is top-class,\nand many of the best keepers come out of it.
So that's why I need to go to Germany!
I'm going to be the best keeper\nthe world has ever seen!
Eyes set on the horizon, Wakabayashi still had one thing\nto do. He challenged Tsubasa to a showdown. One on one.
In the spot where they first met, where they had their first face\noff, the two young prodigies stood facing each other once again.
Bring it on, Tsubasa! One play, one winner!
Not even you can score on me\nfrom outside the box!
I'm not coming back until\nI'm a pro in Germany, Tsubasa!
Wakabayashi... I'm going to Nankatsu\nMiddle School, too! With everyone else!
But I'm not giving up on my dream! I'll play with\nNankatsu Middle, and someday I'm going to Brazil!
Yeah? I see. Then next time we meet\nit'll be playing for Japan.
Both vowing to fulfill their dreams,\nthe two boys shared a handshake.
Until, then... Farewell, Tsubasa.
Nankatsu Elementary vs. Shutetsu Elementary\nNankatsu was nearly caught in Shutetsu's birdcage.
While Ishizaki managed to smash the "cage" and\npush the game into overtime, it cost him dearly.
Stepping onto the field for the Nankatsu team\nwas a bit of surprise... Last minute addition:
Hi, I'm Taro Misaki.
Often changing schools because of his wandering\nartist father, Misaki only just transferred in.
You're good...
Misaki possessed superb technique,\neven on par with Tsubasa.
Nice to meet you, Tsubasa.
Tak! You too, Misaki!
Tsubasa and Misaki displayed phenomenal coordinated\nplay from the moment the overtime clock started.
You're amazing, Misaki! It's like you\nknow what I'm thinking just by watching me!
I feel exactly the same, Tsubasa!
But Shutetsu, led by the genius goalkeeper\nWakabayashi, had plenty of fight left.
Abandoning his duel with Tsubasa and focusing on helping his\nteam, Wakabayashi scored a goal and retook the lead for his team.
I won't let them say we lost because of me.
True to his word, in the final half Misaki made\nan assist that stole a goal and tied up the game.
The game ended in a tie,\nbut it would be later remembered as...
It was here the stars aligned and the Golden Duo\nof Tsubasa and Misaki first came together.
Tsubasa, Misaki, and Ishizaki were chosen, along\nwith Wakabayashi, his team, and their rival Urabe.
...To represent Nankatsu City in the National Youth\nSoccer Tournament, as Nankatsu SC.
Of course, to make it to Nationals, they first needed\nto win at the Shizuoka Regionals.
There, a fierce semifinals ended up leading to\ngreater glory. They had made it to Nationals.
Even while losing their first game against Meiwa\nFC, Tsubasa and Misaki's duo play was in top form.
Nice shot, Misaki!
Nice pass, Tsubasa!
Even with the finals tournament on the line, they\nput on a show in their match against Hanawa FC.
Somewhere along the line, people\nstarted calling them the Golden Duo.
During the game, Ishizaki swapped in for Nishio,\nand then... shamefully scored on his own goal.
It was Misaki who stopped their\nteammates from crucifying him.
I've kept quiet so far, but... This is the last\ntournament I'll be able to play with you guys.
So let's stop this.\nI don't want to see us fighting.
I just got here, but this is the first time I've\nbeen on a team long enough to go to Nationals.
So I want us to stick together until we win\nthe championship... No matter what!
After a heartfelt plea, the team rallied, and\nIshizaki even redeemed himself with an assist.
But with only a minute left and Hanawa tightening\nup their defenses, even Misaki began to lose hope.
Is this... Is this our last game together?
But then...
Misaki! Look up!
Of course!
As if sensing Misaki's feelings and offering him an escape,\nTsubasa made a last minute goal, turning the game around.
Nankatsu SC had overcome Hanawa FC,\nmaking it to the finals tournament.
Thank you, Tsubasa...\nNow, I can continue playing with everyone.
Nankatsu finally reached the semifinals. In their\nway was the Young Noble of the Field, Jun Misugi.
H-He's too good!
Can... Can he even be beaten?
Stand up, Tsubasa!
Are you going to let it end like this?! Are you going\nto let all our effort to make it this far go to waste?!
Is this how you intend to go out?
Weren't you going to come\nwith me to Brazil, Tsubasa?!
You can do it, Tsubasa! I'm cheering for you!\nGo, fight, win!
They're right, Tsubasa.
Not even Misugi thinks that's the best you've got.
You can't let this be the finale.
That would be betraying your teammates, your fans,\nyour rivals... and even this soccer ball itself.
Everyone's words re-ignited\nTsubasa's fighting spirit.
And the reinvigorated Tsubasa took his\nnewfound determination and set his eyes on victory.
Misaki!
Back at you, Tsubasa!
Tsubasa, Misaki, and the Nankatsu SC once again took on\nthe prodigy Jun Misugi with their stunning combinations!
But Misugi still overpowered them.
Struggling past his heart condition, Misugi bet\neverything on one play and scored on Nankatsu.
His teammates in Musashi FC also responded to his\ndetermination, leaving Nankatsu in quite a pinch.
We haven't lost yet.
It's still too soon to say farewell!
Woo! I did it!
Thanks to Misaki's do-or-die header\ninto the goal, Nankatsu tied the game back up!
It's not over yet! We don't get to end\nthe game early just cuz we feel like it!
And with little time remaining, everyone was\nsure it'd end in a tie. Everyone... but Tsubasa.
Tsubasa went for an extreme longshot!
The ball hit the net as the referee's\nwhistle blew. The match was decided.
National Tournament Finals:\nNankatsu SC vs. Meiwa FC
This was a grudge match for Nankatsu against\nthe team that gave them their first loss.
Not only that, the captain of Meiwa FC, Kojiro Hyuga, was\nan old teammate of Misaki's from Meiwa Elementary.
But now I'm honored to be a part of Nankatsu SC.\nTsubasa and I are winning this together!
And just as he said, Misaki and Tsubasa took\nthe first point of the game with their Twin Shot.
But a tiger shows its fangs when cornered. Both\nMisaki and Tsubasa were injured by his ferocity.
To make matters worse, Nankatsu's genius keeper\nWakabayashi was pained by an old leg injury.
Somehow they managed to make it to overtime,\nright as Misaki's leg reached its limit.
Misaki's father, Ichiro, interjected.
If it's about whether he can or can't,\nisn't he the best judge of that?
I'm okay. I can do this.
Put me back on the pitch, and you'll see\nI can fight through to the end.
Run ragged by the match, Nankatsu SC\nbet everything on one final push.
The game continued to heat up as\none game extension gave way to another.
Even if my leg breaks...\nI'll play to the final whistle!
Misaki kept on fighting through the pain, giving\nevery last ounce of devotion to the final match.
However...
Is this it for me?! Mom! Dad!\nI know you're out there! Cheer for me!
Let's blitz them, Misaki!
You're the only one who can keep up with me,\nthe only one I can count on for this.
We can do this!\nLet's show them what the Golden Duo can do!
Mom, Dad, Tsubasa...
This is my last play!
Not even Hyuga or Wakashimazu\ncould stop the hurricane duo.
But the Fierce Tiger and his team\nweren't about to roll over and die.
How can you two do that with no planning\nor nothin'? Are you guys psychic 'er what?
The flames of the heated confrontation\nwere pitched to soar even higher.
I can't let him score! No matter what happens,\nI can't let this shot through!
We have to win!
Misaki...
Tsu-Tsubasa...
Misaki had offered up his body to stop the ball and now\nit was being kicked toward Meiwa's goal... Toward victory!
And so Tsubasa slipped past Hyuga...\nPast Wakashimazu...
We won! Nankatsu is the champion!
Finally, victory rested peacefully\nin the palms of their hands.
After a desperate struggle at the National Youth Soccer Tournament,\nthe members of Nankatsu SC headed home to Nankatsu City.
Misaki was preparing to set off once again\nwith his traveling father, Ichiro.
His teammates in Nankatsu SC gave him a parting\ngift: a soccer ball with all their signatures.
All except Tsubasa, whose promise to move\nto Brazil with Roberto had been broken.
What's the point if it doesn't\nhave Tsubasa's signature?
Ishizaki led them to Tsubasa's house\nto ask him to sign when...
I thought you were leaving tomorrow!
I'm sorry... I thought it'd be too hard\nto meet up again only to say goodbye...
As the scheduled bus approached,\nIshizaki frantically searched for Tsubasa.
Roberto... I...\nI really did want to go to Brazil...
Tsubasa!
It's awful, Tsubasa! Misaki's... He's...!
Huh?
Misaki!
Goodbye, Tsubasa! Stay strong!
Misaki! Here, catch!
We'll duo again on All-Japan. -Tsubasa Ozora
Thank you, Tsubasa! Thank you, everyone!
Tsubasa and Misaki, the Golden Duo, held their\npromise in their hearts and went their own ways.
Roberto Hongo...
A former center forward of the Brazilian National\nTeam, a pro descended from Japanese immigrants.
What the...?! He kicked it under a moving bus?
And the way he dribbles... Looks like he's already\nfriends with the ball, and at such a young age!
No doubt about it, this kid is... This kid is...!
The ball's still in play!
Wahoo!
If I center the ball, then...
Take the shot!
Invited to Nankatsu by Tsubasa's father Kodai,\nRoberto met Tsubasa, discovering a soccer prodigy.
Viva Tsubasa!
While staying with Tsubasa he became coach of\nthe notoriously weak Nankatsu Elementary SC.
The results of my medical diagnosis were clear:\nI have a detached retina.
They caught it too late.\nIf I keep playing soccer...
And take a hit while playing...
I could be permanently blinded.
His career as a soccer player\neffectively ended by the injury...
...He tried to throw himself into the sea,\nbut was saved by Tsubasa's father.
Battling with depression, as a guest in Japan...
Tsubasa! Do you love soccer?
Do you even need to ask? Of course!
He met Tsubasa and found a new reason to live.
Now, a ray of light has cut into my vision.
It's Tsubasa Ozora. I'll bet everything\non him taking flight on the world stage.
Even now that I've left the field,\nI can still make soccer my life.
After learning of Roberto's retirement\nduring practice, Tsubasa rushed home.
On one side was Roberto, claiming that he'd\ntrain Tsubasa to be a world-class soccer player.
So please, let me take him with me to Brazil!
At Roberto's words, Tsubasa also...
I'm going to Brazil, Roberto!
Going to the soccer capital of the world, Brazil,\nwith Roberto became Tsubasa's drive in life.
However...
As Roberto watched Tsubasa overcome his rivals and\nimprove daily, doubt started gnawing away at him.
The captain, his wife, and Tsubasa...\nThe Ozora household is already a happy one.
He should be together with his family.\nI'd just be breaking them apart.
But everyone's already agreed to it...\nWhy am I the only one hesitating?
And aren't I the one who brought\nit up in the first place?
Wracked by these worries, Roberto watched Tsubasa\ngrow, match after match. Until finally...
Maybe... Maybe he doesn't need me anymore.
Tsubasa has managed to win at Nationals and defeat\nhis impressive rival from Meiwa FC, Kojiro Hyuga.
This tournament has been another\nnotable step forward for you.
But Tsubasa... I can't keep my promise to you.
Once we win, let's go to Brazil, Roberto!
Staying behind to see Tsubasa's win with his own\neyes, Roberto then readied to return to Brazil alone.
No matter what reason I may've had, I've failed as\na player by giving up playing the beautiful game.
Someone like me can't teach you what\nit means to live for soccer.
I'm going back to Brazil on my own. Should we meet\nagain... I can't imagine how long from now it will likely be.
Goodbye, Tsubasa.
The reason I tried so hard was\nto go to Brazil with you!
And I won the tournament, just like I promised!
Why did you leave without me? Roberto!
Hanji Urabe...
The very first opponent of Nankatsu's reborn club,\nwith Roberto coaching and Tsubasa at the center...
...was Nishigaoka Elementary, captained by Urabe.
What an unimpressive tackle!
You'll never stop the unique talents of the\ncaptain of the Nishigaoka team with that!
Urabe's team thought little of Nankatsu after\nthey lost 30-0 to Wakabayashi's Shutetsu, but...
Go!
Starting with a goal scored by Tsubasa's super\nlongshot, Nankatsu kept control the entire game.
No way...
Having seen Tsubasa's skill and Nankatsu's growth with his own eyes,\nUrabe came to spectate the grudge match between Nankatsu and Shutetsu.
Oh no! Ishizaki is injured?!
Tak! Is there anyone who can take his place?
I'll do it! The one-and-only Hanji Urabe!
No, I'll do it! I'm way better than that guy!
Urabe offered to replace the injured Ishizaki,\ncompeting with his future Otomo teammate, Kishida.
However...
After Taro Misaki transferred\nto Nankatsu Elementary...
Urabe was chosen to take part in the tournament\nas part of Nankatsu SC, playing alongside Tsubasa.
Nankatsu faced many struggles at the tournament,\nbut pulled through with grit and spirit each time.
It's not over yet! We haven't lost yet!
And so Urabe fought through his own hardships, and\neventually became a champion alongside the rest of the team.
It's time, Coach!
You go without me. It won't make\nmuch difference if I'm there or not.
Listen up, Kojiro. If you're in a match, you've gotta\nwin. As long as you win, no one can complain.
Get me the ball and I'll get us the points! Do\nit like your life depends on it! We play to win!
That's right, Kojiro. The best defense is\na good offense. Put the screws to 'em.
Kojiro Hyuga was obsessed with winning. In that\nsense, he embodied the teachings of his coach, Kira.
It was that obsession that carried him to victory over Tsubasa's\nNankatsu SC in the first match of the National Youth Soccer Tournament.
Even afterward, Meiwa FC advanced through\nthe tournament, winning every match, but...
Now, the first match of the semifinals, against\nnorth Hokkaido's Furano led by Hikaru Matsuyama.
Though he was the core of the team,\nsomething weird was happening to Hyuga.
You can't keep this up Kojiro. Working part time\nfor family AND single-handedly leading the team...
A normal kid's nerves would've\nbeen shredded by now.
After defeating Furano and advancing\nto the finals, Hyuga collapsed.
But the Fierce Tiger would not be content to hide away and lick his\nwounds, and he managed a miraculous recovery by the day of the finals.
Up until now, I never thought I needed\nany of that stuff like teamwork.
But after thinking it out, I know I\ncan't do it all on my own.
And I guess you do need a little\ntrust in your teammates...
I wanna win this match. I REALLY wanna win. So\ncould you guys lend me a hand, one last time?
That's Kojiro for ya. A sleeping tiger who returns\nbetter than ever after just one night of rest.
You can do this! You can win this tournament!
Their opponent in the finals would be the very same\nteam they beat in the first match: Nankatsu SC.
It was looking bad for Nankatsu with\nMeiwa FC's tiger, Kojiro Hyuga, out for blood.
Both teams fought into overtime, and extended\novertime before Tsubasa scored the deciding goal.
Fly!
Figures. We lost, Tsubasa.
Regrettably, Meiwa FC finished\nthe tournament in second place.
But Coach Kira was satisfied\nseeing his students play their best...
And supported Hyuga's dream from behind the\nscenes, even as he was recruited by Toho Academy.
Captain of Saitama's best, Meiwa FC,\nand ace striker: Kojiro Hyuga.
He was nicknamed "the Fierce Tiger"\nfor his aggressive and powerful plays.
Misaki, who'd played with Hyuga, warned that Meiwa\nwould be the biggest obstacle going to the top.
Because their ace striker, Kojiro Hyuga,\nwas just as good as Tsubasa.
Meiwa FC... and Kojiro Hyuga...
You Wakabayashi?
One day, Hyuga suddenly intruded on Nankatsu SC's practice\nand challenged their genius goalkeeper Wakabayashi to a duel.
Let's do this, Wakabayashi! I wanna see\nwhat it takes for people to call ya a prodigy!
Showing off his rough playstyle, he drove the ball\npast Wakabayashi into the net before setting off.
Ha ha ha!
We're definitely making it to Nationals,\nand Hyuga will, too. We'll get him back for this!
Just as Wakabayashi said, as soon as Nankatsu won\nin Regionals, they were set to play against Meiwa.
My soccer is winning soccer!\nI'll win, whatever it takes!
They encountered Hyuga again\nin the very first match of Nationals.
We're winnin' this whole thing,\nso this is just a step on the way!
The aces of both teams, Tsubasa and Hyuga, clashed! After a\nferocious back-and-forth, Nankatsu scored the first goal.
You won't be the champions, Meiwa...\nBecause we will!
The flames of competition were stoked in Hyuga\nwhen the unmarked Tsubasa Ozora scored first.
My soccer is different from yours!\nI'm not just playing around!
I'm not playing around either!
Soccer is my life!
The furious give-and-take\nbetween the two continued.
But Hyuga showed a drive to win that surprised\neven Tsubasa, giving Tsubasa his first loss.
And yet...
In that last clash... I lost completely.
Hyuga felt that he'd personally lost to Tsubasa.
Me? In Toho Academy?!
From winning over Nankatsu in the first match,\nHyuga was scouted for the famous Toho Academy.
With a Toho scholarship, he'd have a free ride\nuntil college, and could devote himself to soccer.
But only if he could first crush Tsubasa\nat Nationals and win the championship.
After losing his father, Hyuga's mother\nand three siblings had had a hard life.
To Hyuga, who'd worked part time to support his\nfamily while keeping up with soccer practice...
...The invitation to Toho Academy\nwas everything he could have hoped for.
All right! I have to win this thing now!
With this new determination, Hyuga became\neven more obsessed with victory than before.
After a fateful run-in in the cafeteria, Hyuga was fired up to take on\nFurano Elementary and their captain Hikaru Matsuyama in the semifinals.
Despite his body battered by the constant matches,\nHyuga scraped out a win, taking him to finals.
Naturally he found himself facing his old nemesis\nfrom the first match: Tsubasa and the Nankatsu SC.
Tsubasa! We're settling this here and now!
You're on, Hyuga!
With Wakabayashi back in the game, the fierce\nbattle went into overtime and extended overtime.
Even with Wakabayashi overcoming his injuries\nand the Golden Duo toying with the defense...
Hyuga never lost his fighting spirit,\nright down to the very last second.
Tsubasa! Misaki! I learned this from you two.
You can't win a soccer match on your own.
And soccer is about more than strength.
Right now, I'm not doing this for my family. I'm not even doin' this to win.
I just realized that I'm playing cuz it's fun.\nCuz we're rivals.
But that's exactly why I'm not\ngivin' up until I win!
In the end, I play soccer to win! If ya don't win,\nit don't matter how much fun you had!
But even though Hyuga continued to carry his convictions\nwith him, Tsubasa was also sprinting toward his big dream.
Just one more point, and we'll\nreally be the champs! And then...
And then I can go to Brazil!
I won't let anyone else have the ball.\nNot until I get that one last point!
This is it, Tsubasa! Once I get that ball from\nyou, I'm betting everythin' on one last longshot!
And when the two titans clashed,\nthe one left standing was... Tsubasa.
I lost...
They may have lost, but Hyuga had given it his all\nand gracefully accepted a handshake from Tsubasa.
In that last faceoff, I didn't just lose in skill,\nI lost in power. You deserve the title, Tsubasa.
Even though he failed to meet their conditions,\nToho Academy saw his skill and kept their offer.
I-I... Thank you! I'll never forget this!
And so Kojiro Hyuga set off on a new journey,\nto clear his own path.
Congrats on the win, Tsubasa!
See you at Nationals! The school I'm transferring\nto, Musashi, was chosen to represent Tokyo!
Right after Tsubasa won the Shizuoka Regionals,\nformer classmate Yayoi Aoba called out to him.
Standing beside her was Musashi FC's captain,\nJun Misugi, the most promising young player in Japan.
Nice to meet you. I'm Misugi, from Musashi FC.
Same! I'm Tsubasa Ozora!
I'm looking forward to facing you someday.
He was nicknamed the Young Noble of the Field for\nhis flawless footwork, passes, and leadership.
But he was hiding a secret...
Please, just let him have this one win! He's got\na weak heart, and can't play soccer much longer!
Yayoi's words hit Tsubasa like a truck.\nBut still, he refused her request.
It's my dream to win this tournament, too.\nAnd then I can go to Brazil with Roberto!
Brazil is the soccer capital of the world.\nAnd I'm going to turn pro there.
So it doesn't matter who or why,\nI can't lose here!
Could Misugi even be happy if\nI didn't take this match seriously?
And so Nankatsu SC and Musashi FC\nmet in the semifinals.
The time's finally come, Tsubasa.
Misugi, I promise you that no matter what happens,\nevery ounce of my being is going into this match.
With all these feelings intersecting,\nthe kickoff commenced the game.
Tsubasa and Misugi, both called prodigies,\ncame head to head in the opening moments.
I won't lose to my disease,\nand I'm not losing to you either!
For every point Misugi took, Tsubasa took\none back. They were evenly matched. Until...
It can't be! Musashi's mastered the offside trap?!
With 5 minutes left in the second half, Musashi\nunleashed their secret weapon: the offside trap.
Tsubasa found himself losing to despair, as he\ncouldn't overcome Misugi's superior technique.
I'm just no match for him...
What's wrong, Tsubasa?\nWhere'd that spirit of yours go?!
It's no use... I just can't beat him.
Stand up, Tsubasa!
Are you finished already?!
Weren't you going to come\nwith me to Brazil, Tsubasa?!
You can do it, Tsubasa!\nI'm cheering for you! So win!
Not even Misugi thinks that's the best you've got.
That would be betraying your teammates, your fans,\nyour rivals... and even this soccer ball itself.
Starting with the freshly recovered Wakabayashi,\nall of Tsubasa's friends cheered him on.
And Tsubasa regained his confidence.
That's right... It can't end like this. All I was\ndoing was stomping all over everyone's feelings.
I have to do this.
Reinvigorated, Tsubasa escaped the offside trap\nand set about chipping away at Musashi's lead.
An amazing comeback, Tsubasa.
But now we settle this!
But in the middle of their showdown,\nMisugi's heart gave out.
I'm sorry... for hiding it so long. As you might\nbe able to tell, my heart's not quite right.
That's why I've only been playing\na little each game.
But this one's different. We won't win\nagainst Nankatsu in just a few minutes.
It's decided.\nWe'll win this even if it's my last game ever!
Which means I'm giving this my all,\nright to the final curtain!
Our duel isn't over yet, Tsubasa!
As the rain poured down on the field, Misugi\nendured the pain in his chest and pushed forward.
The ball... My ball...\nWhere's... my ball?! Where?!
It's in front of you to your right, Captain!
Amidst his suffering, he managed\nto struggle his way to scoring.
Misugi!
I can still... move...
Don't worry... My heart's still beating!
With a life literally on the line, it all came down to\none last point. And the one who scored it was...
It's not over yet! We don't get to end\nthe game early just cuz we feel like it!
Unrelenting, Tsubasa made a miraculous last\nsecond super longshot, turning the game around.
I don't think I'll quit soccer after all.
Even if I can only play a minute or two at a time,\nI can still stand on that field.
And I'll beat even this heart condition, someday.
Meiwa vs. Furano... Furano's captain Matsuyama\nwas preparing for a penalty kick when...
Stop! We're switching goalies!
Ken Wakashimazu, who'd been coached by Kozo Kira,\nwith Kojiro Hyuga and Takeshi Sawada, appeared.
He was making his return after being\ninjured in a traffic accident months ago.
Let's do this, Captain!
Wakashimazu stopped Matsuyama's shot with an amazing\ncatch and pulled Meiwa FC back from the brink of defeat.
From this match on, Wakashimazu's incredible\nreflexes and acrobatic kicks off the goalposts...
...Would become the iron wall of Meiwa.
But after beating Furano, Meiwa FC would next face\ntheir biggest rival, Nankatsu SC, in the finals.
But not even Nankatsu's Golden Duo of Tsubasa\nand Misaki could break Wakashimazu's iron wall.
Sorry, but as long as I'm here,\nyou won't be scoring a single goal!
I knew Wakashimazu had it in him.\nThat boy's from a long line of karate masters.
He got those reflexes from practicing martial\narts, way before he ever got into soccer.
The way he kicks off of the goalposts\ncomes from a karate technique, too.
Nankatsu vs. Meiwa... As the finals entered\nextended overtime, Wakashimazu joined the offense.
Hyah!
Using his karate experience, he let loose a shot\nwith a kick with a power that rivaled Hyuga's!
Until finally, even with Hyuga's last ditch\neffort to stop Tsubasa, Meiwa lost the match.
But after the grueling game was over, Meiwa\npraised Nankatsu for giving them a great match.
Sheesh, you're really something.\nI've never conceded 4 goals in a match before.
This is our time to shine, Takeshi. Let's go.
Right, Captain!
Meiwa FC's Takeshi Sawada...
Another student of Kozo Kira's,\nalongside Kojiro Hyuga.
Sawada admired Hyuga and specialized in assists,\nmaking even the 4th grader an important teammate.
With Sawada's endless assists, Hyuga could keep\nup nonstop pressure on Tsubasa and Nankatsu SC.
I could only take the test to sign up\nfor this team because of Hyuga.
And after learning that he's also working to\nsupport his family... I admire him more and more.
That's why I swore I'd\nhelp him win the championship.
To the Hyuga he admired, he brought\nhis frank advice and strong spirit.
National Youth Soccer Tournament, Final Match...
Having been given the condition that he had to win the tournament\nto be recruited by Toho Academy, Hyuga was itching to show his skills.
In particular, he was insistent on making a shot against the genius\ngoalkeeper Genzo Wakabayashi from outside the penalty box.
I'm going to be blunt here, Hyuga. What you're\ndoing now isn't the soccer we were taught to play!
At Meiwa, we play to win, don't we?
So why are you so obsessed with scoring\nfrom outside the penalty box?
This... This isn't Meiwa's soccer!
Honestly, this match will decide\nwhether I can go to Toho Academy or not...
They scouted me after the first match.
But they said they had their eye on Tsubasa, too,\nso they're gonna decide after this match.
I've gotta prove that I'm better than him.\nThat's why I'm shooting from outside the box.
But... You're right. I lost my cool.\nThanks for opening my eyes.
We'll do whatever it takes to score on Wakabayashi\nthis half! Cuz we're Meiwa, and we play to win!
I knew you'd come to your senses, Hyuga!
Sawada's words opened Hyuga's eyes. He took\ncommand, and pushed Nankatsu into a corner.
Despite his loss, Hyuga's ambitious plays\nimpressed Toho so much they recruited him anyway.
Here, Kazuo!
Hey! Nice pass!
What're you two doing?!
Are you guys playing in Nationals, too?
Yeah, why?
We're from Akita's Hanawa Soccer Club!\nNice to meetcha!
And that was when they met Hanawa's twin aces:\nMasao and Kazuo Tachibana.
They were a match for even Meiwa FC, the team that defeated Nankatsu SC in the first match.
Nankatsu collided with them in the prelims, with\ntheir place in the finals tournament on the line.
The Tachibana twins used\nexceptionally coordinated combo plays.
Their coordination was even a match\nfor Tsubasa and Misaki, the Golden Duo.
Those two are raw fire, Masao.
Though Nankatsu had taken the first point, the\nTachibanas' aerial techniques evened the score.
See that?! That was our patented Triangle Shot!
However, the leaping Kazuo collided with Nankatsu SC's Nishio.\nSince Nishio was injured, he switched out with Ishizaki.
The Tachibanas continued to torment Nankatsu with their aerial soccer\nuntil Ishizaki made a critical mistake by kicking the ball into Nankatsu's goal.
With everyone on the team angry with Ishizaki, Misaki stepped in,\nknowing that he'd have to change schools again once the match was over.
Ishizaki also wanted to make up for his mistake, intercepting\nthe ball with his body and letting loose a longshot.
And thanks to Misaki's push,\nthey brought the score to a tie.
If Nankatsu couldn't beat Hanawa,\nthey wouldn't be a part of the finals tournament.
The Tachibanas tried to hold on, while Tsubasa\nand Misaki unleashed their own fierce combo plays.
Misaki! Look up!
Of course!
The match was won, thanks to\nTsubasa's own version of aerial soccer.
You gotta be kidding!
We did everything we could,\nand right at the end it all went poof!
You've gotta do well in the\nfinals tournament now. For us, too.
Sure thing!
And that was how Nankatsu\nadvanced to the finals tournament.
Furano Elementary Soccer Club, representing\nnorth Hokkaido, Captain Hikaru Matsuyama
A small club with only 11 members, their tireless\nefforts were rewarded when they made Nationals.
Misaki!
It's Matsuyama and the guys!
He was also Misaki's former teammate.
When Matsuyama bumped into Meiwa FC's Kojiro\nHyuga, Hyuga threw a punch and a fight broke out.
And as if by fate the two teams were brought\ntogether as opponents for the semifinals.
I still owe you a few licks from the cafeteria,\nKojiro Hyuga.
What's all this about teamwork?\nI'll crush your weak soccer!
The two aces' one-on-one battle\nbegan right from the kickoff.
I hope you're ready for this, Hyuga!
You're not as bad as you look!
Meiwa's play was built around their ace striker,\nbut Furano faced them with teamwork and pluck.
There goes your sliding tackle!
Wh-Why you little! You baited me!
Just you watch, Hyuga!\nYou can't win in soccer by yourself!
There's no way we're losing to\na one-man team like yours!
The game went back and forth with Furano taking\na point back whenever Meiwa took the lead.
In the second half, Matsuyama's\ninjured leg throbbed in pain.
Tch! Darn it... I can't let this beat me.
We've trained more than anyone!
This is nothing compared to all that\nharsh training in the winter snows!
With guts and teamwork, Furano continued to\npush back right up to the end of the match...
When thanks to a shot following a Meiwa handball, both\nteams were tied. Everything came down to a penalty shootout.
I-I'm not gonna screw this up!\nWho do you think I am...?
We all made it this far together. So we should end\nit together, too, and win this shootout as a team!
Matsuyama finally had Hyuga cornered. However...
We're switching goalies!
Thanks to Meiwa's immortal goalie,\nWakashimazu, he was unable to score.
And with Hyuga focused solely on winning, he\ntook his best shot, and... Furano lost the game.
As tear poured down over\nhis teammate's face, Matsuyama spoke.
Don't cry. We made it this far by giving it our\nall, so let's head home with our heads held high.
The sight of Hyuga giving it everything\nhe had was also seared into his mind.
Hyuga... I know I've said a lot about you, but...\nYou're always giving everything you got.
I realized that after playing against you today.
And while we lost today...\nSomeday I want to take you on again, Kojiro Hyuga.
Deep in his heart, he wanted a rematch.
Captain of Nankatsu Soccer Club, Ryo Ishizaki, met\nTsubasa while confronting Shutetsu's Wakabayashi.
Get in there!
Wha-Wha-Wha?!
After meeting Tsubasa and Roberto Hongo,\nthe soccer club and Ishizaki readily improved.
I... I can't believe it...\nI actually scored a goal.
Against Shutetsu, he broke open the "birdcage" by\ngetting Tsubasa the ball, despite his injured leg.
He also made it onto Nankatsu SC,\nthe team headed for Nationals.
While he was just a substitute, he went to Nationals\nalong with Tsubasa, Misaki, and Nishigaoka's Urabe.
Against Hanawa, he switched in for the injured\nNishio only to fumble the ball into his own goal.
Only Misaki stepped in to defend him, knowing that\nhe'd have to transfer again after the tournament.
But feeling his own sense of duty to the team,\nhe managed a magnificent interception.
It's my fault they took the lead! We all worked so\nhard to get here! Like heck I'll leave it at that!
Just one more goal! For Misaki!
I'll get it!
In order to make up for his error, he put\neverything behind a longshot and scored a goal.
Later, in both the semifinals against Misugi's\nMusashi and the finals against Hyuga's Meiwa...
Ishizaki continued to contribute by face-blocking shots and\nmaking other gutsy plays, paving the way for Nankatsu's victory.

EPISODE: NEW HERO
Episode: New Hero
We recommend playing this mode after clearing\nEPISODE: TSUBASA and becoming accustomed to\ngameplay.\n \nStart?
 
 
 
Led by Captain Matsuyama, this school's players\nbattle with the snows of the great white north day\nin and day out. Their starting lineup has played\ntogether since elementary school, evolving\nsuperior coordination and defense that stand out\nas some of the best in the nation. Making friends\nwith them would surely lead to growth on the team.
This top school has many Musashi FC alumni, a\nprestigious elementary school team that's had\n1,000+ members. The team emphasizes defense at the\nstart to allow renowned player Misugi, who can\nonly play one half, to score big in the second\nhalf of games. More options on offense at the\nstart of a game would make this team untouchable.\nCan you fill that role?
Prominent players handpicked nationwide gather\nhere. Pride in their excellence drives them. The\nteam's trio of ace striker Hyuga, technician\nSawada, and top goalie Wakashimazu make up the\nheart of the team. Their matches are always\nfierce, but provide opportunities for invaluable\nexperience.

Furano MS's teamwork shines on their defense.\nIf they could compensate for their weak offense,\nthey would be on par with Nankatsu or Toho.\nForward stats will develop quickly.
Matsuyama's position. He often tries to score by\nshooting from a distance, so the best way to\nsupport him is playing up field closer to the\ngoal. Midfielder stats will develop quickly.
This position integrates highly with Furano MS's\ncombo plays. Taking passes off of Kato's blocks,\nthe ball is moved up to midfielder Matsuyama,\nwho boasts powerful long shots.\nDefender stats will develop quickly.
This position fits into the powerful Top Trio as\npart of a robust offense, and allows the team to\nturn Misugi's skilled passing into points. Become\nthe highest scoring team in any tournament!\nForward stats will develop quickly.
Misugi shares this position.\nLearn by seeing his marvelous playstyle up close,\nand someday soon the world may be watching you.\nMidfielder stats will develop quickly.
Musashi MS's defense is currently outclassed by Furano \nMS's teamwork and Toho Academy's renowned keeper, \nWakashimazu, so getting a capable player in this \nposition would cement Musashi MS as a top school.\nDefender stats will develop quickly.
The same position as Hyuga. Toho's offensive \nstrength is remarkable by any measure. Sawada's \npasses allow for numerous scoring opportunities. \nForward stats will develop quickly.
Sawada's position. The more passes to Toho\nforwards Hyuga and Sorimachi, the more scoring\nopportunities. Make sure they get the best chance\nevery time. Midfielder stats will develop quickly.
The nation's top keeper, Wakashimazu, ensures\na rock solid defense, but his defenders help\nkeep him out of tough spots. That's you.\nDefender stats will develop quickly.

A Golden Generation of Japanese players,\nincluding Tsubasa Ozora and Kojiro Hyuga, had\ngathered at the National MS Soccer Tournament.
And after a series of tense bouts,\nNankatsu MS and Toho Academy were\nboth crowned the champions of the nation.
But these events inked only the first page of a\nnew Beginning.
The start of a new challenge for the Golden\nGeneration.
Wh-What did you say?!
The French International Juniors Youth Tournament\nwas canceled?!
I see... But... You can't be serious!
Understood. We'll return to HQ right away.
Did I hear that right, Katagiri? The French\nInternational tourney has been canceled?
Yes, your ears are working properly.\nI still don't know the details myself though.
Apparently, it was just announced that the\nFrench International we were going to\nparticipate in after Nationals was canceled.
They've also announced a new tournament they're\ncalling the Junior Youth World Challenge to be\nheld in America.
Wait, what now? So, what are we doing?
Since HQ has received an invitation from the\norganizers of this new tournament, they want us\nto gather information on it posthaste.
We're heading back, Mikami.
Understood.
For now though, let's try to sort through what\ninfo we've already gathered.
Good idea.
First of all, this new "Junior Youth World\nChallenge" is being held two months from now.
They plan to have all the same participating\ncountries as the French International, but I would\nexpect there to be some withdrawals.
One thing to watch out for is a lot of new\ncountries are getting a chance to participate.
The key ones are America, who's hosting; Senegal,\nthe hope of Africa; the Netherlands, with its\nstrong tradition of soccer; and...
...O país do futebol itself, Brazil.
...This'll really ratchet up the competition.\nEach of those nations fields have very skilled\nteams.
I've also received word that the scrimmages we'd\nplanned against foreign teams to toughen up the\nJapanese team for the French International...
...have largely been canceled by requests made to\nthe Association. We're talking Germany, Italy,\nthe Netherlands...
Most likely their organizations are changing up\ntheir own training schedules.
It's not just those three either,\nFrance and other countries must\nbe thinking the same thing.
So is this what that rumor was about then?
What rumor?
There was some talk at the German Soccer\nAssociation right before I left.
Murmurs about countries unhappy about not being\ninvited to the French International planning\nsomething together.
But word was it was just some scheme to get into\nthe French International.
Who could've imagined they'd get it canceled and\nreplace it with their own tourney instead!
I've also received word that the scrimmages we'd\nplanned against foreign teams to toughen up the\nJapanese team for the French International...
...have largely been canceled by requests made\nto the Association. We're talking Germany, Italy,\nthe Netherlands...
Most likely their organizations are\nchanging up their own training schedules.
I'm sure that extends to all competitors...\nFrance and other countries must be thinking\nthe same thing.
Those of us preparing for the\nFrench International had built our training\nregimens around the competing teams...
But this is going to be far more fierce than\nanything we'd been preparing for.
I know Tsubasa Ozora and Hyuga are\nconsidered the Golden Generation, but...
This is going to be far beyond anything they've\nfaced before.
The plan was to take candidates from Nationals,\nand then put together a team through a training\ncamp.
Then we'd scrim other teams around Europe before\nproceeding to the French International.
But if teams are calling off the practice\nmatches, the tour is out of the question, too.
So now we just have months of empty \nschedule between Nationals and whatever \nthis new tournament is.
We can't just run a training camp for that whole\ntime.
We'd hoped to encourage the growth of our players\nby putting them up against other good teams,\nbut it's become difficult to find opponents.
That said, it's likely to be difficult to find\nnew teams to play against from outside\nJapan this late in the game.
And we don't have all that many players at that\nlevel within our country either. It will be\ndifficult to make good use of this free month.
...
We're not working with a lot of time, but we need\nto rework the training schedule somehow.
Right. Well, this is our chance to pave\nthe way for the future of Japanese soccer.\nIt is not an opportunity we can afford to waste!
This club room's been like a home for\nthree years, but today we're saying goodbye.
Hey, make sure everything is spick and span.\nThere will be other players looking for just such\na home after we're gone.
Hey, look at this! This is from the tournament\nduring our first year!
Hm? Ew, gross!
Blegh! Whose is this? What is this doing here?
*pant* *pant*
*pant* *pant*
H-Hey, big news guys!
"Junior Hero League"?
Y-Yes.
I hear they're having an exhibition league\nto decide who gets to represent Japan in\nAmerica next month.
So it's like a kind of qualifiers then?
I guess. The school got a call from the Soccer\nAssociation. Best part is...\nCoach said we're going!
H-Hold on, you mean us? Like us standing\nhere, us? Not, like... Furano MS?
H-Hey, you think that means us third years\nget to play one last time before we graduate?
Yeah, they're letting us take part, too!\nI heard it from Coach myself!
For real?
Then we'll be playing together again!
I feel bad for the younger kids, but\nus third years are getting another\nchance to take the main stage!
I thought we were done after we lost to Nankatsu,\nbut I'm getting kinda excited now.
...
Captain?
Oh, sorry... All this is just so unexpected.\nI really don't know what to say.
So guys...\nAre we gonna win this "Junior Hero League"?
Hmmm?
I mean, it's just like Kaneda said.\nWe got beat at Nationals.
I mean we played our best, and we played well.\nThere's no shame in that, but...
Definitely want to go out on a high note.
It's a league, which means round robin. So what\ndo you think happens if we win all our matches?
Yeah... You're right!
I, for one, don't wanna go out on a loss.
Even if these are just exhibition matches,\nlet's push ourselves as far as we can.
This is our second chance. We'll show 'em\nthat the boys from Furano got what it takes.
Are you with me, guys?
Of course, Captain!
Got your back, Cap!
You know it!
All the way!
One hundred percent, Captain!
Umm... Captain?\nI feel bad with everyone so excited, but...
I'm done.
Huh?
Actually, I promised my mom that I'd commit to\nstudying for my entrance exams after Nationals.
I mean, of course I wanna take the field with you\nguys again, and represent Japan at the tournament,\nbut the exams are important...
I'm in the same boat. I gotta study more if I\nwanna get into a good school.
And I've gotta help out on the family farm, my\nparents really need my help.
But we came so far together...
Right. Of course. We all must walk our own paths.
Sorry for not realizing... My bad.
Don't let it get to you.\nThe same pride beats in our chests.
Studying leaves some time for cheering you on!
Go win that Junior Hero League!\nDo it for those of us who can't be there with you.
Aw man, you guys...
You can count on us. We'll always be your team,\nand we'll be together in spirit.
Captain!
Captain!

Alright guys, only one thing left to do now. Win!

Coach gave me this brief overview of the New Hero\nLeague.
Cool, let's look it over.
Oh... so there are 14 teams total, divided\ninto leagues of 7 teams each.
So who's in our half the bracket?
Ummm... Nankatsu, Toho, Musashi...
Hang on a sec... That sounds like all the top\nteams!
I mean, they're deciding who's gonna represent\nJapan. Like, our country. You can't expect easy\ncompetition.
Still though, that's one rough lineup.
...
What's the matter?
It's just... you're right.\nThey're all tough teams.
But we're gonna be hamstringed without Yamamuro\nand the others.
I don't think we can plug in the usual backups\nand expect to make up the difference.
Oh, yeah...
...
I know, what if we add that one guy to the team?
Yeah, that crossed my mind, too. He'd be perfect.
That one guy? Who're you guys talking about?
Oh, that's right. You stayed behind in Saitama to\nsee the finals.
We came home to Furano a little sooner, so we\ncaught the younger kids practicing.
And there's this amazing first year. Kid looks to\nbe straight up gold.
Really? Why didn't we notice him sooner?
He transferred here in July and just joined the\nclub.
Oh... That first year?
I was focused on Hokkaido regionals, so I didn't\nreally watch him much. He's really that good?
You bet. With him on the team, I\nthink we can make things interesting.
Well, now I'm definitely curious.\nI gotta see this kid myself.
Let me get him.
Hey!
Captain wants to see you! Hurry up!
Here he is, Captain!
Thank you.
Sorry for pulling you out of practice.
I don't think we've talked much, have we?\nJust a hello here and there.
So let's get acquainted.\nI'm Matsuyama, captain of the soccer club.\nI've been hearing good things about you.
<avatar_name>, right? I think you were a...
Forward, right?
Midfielder, right?
Defender, right?
Racja! I can't wait to play together!
Wow! You actually remember me?
Nice to meet you...
I'll be a regular?!
That's the spirit!\nYou're already showing a lot of potential.
Ha ha! Humble, aren't you? But of course the\ncaptain has to remember everyone on the team.
C'mon! Where's your fire!
You need to speak up more, or\nyou'll just fade into the background.
C'mon now... Let's not jump the gun here.
Sorry to put you on the spot like this, but...\nShow me what you got.
First things first... Let me say somethin'.
Sorry to put you on the spot like this, but... I'd\nlike to see what you've got.
I'm gonna put you on my team when\nwe all split up for a practice game.
Alright, let's go!
Would you mind kicking the ball around with me a\nlittle?
Okay, okay. Yeah, you're not bad at all.
The deal is there's a tournament coming up soon,\nand we need some talent to fill out our ranks.
Oda vouched you were good, but\nI wanted to see for myself.
And you know what? Oda was right. We could use\nyour help. And I think you might even help us win.
I'm sure it's a bit weird to suddenly join the\nregulars with the third years, but you're one of\nus now.
Let's go all in and go home heroes!
I'll lead the team to victory!
Let's all do our best!
I'll give this everything I've got!
This'll be a cinch with me here!
Well, you certainly seem reliable.
I'm countin' on that stout heart of yours!
Yeah. Furano MS is all about teamwork.
I hope we can count on that strength of yours!
Yeah, soccer is all about hard work.
Looking forward to seeing you\ngive it everything you've got!
I like the confidence.
We don't really have anyone like you on the team,\nbut maybe that'll help kick us into gear.\nI have high hopes for you!
I mean, I know you're new here and don't really\nknow us, but we're not too hard to get along with.\nI promise.
We're on the same team, after all.\nAll for one and one for all, right?
Junior Hero League: First Day.
Man, I can't believe we're back in Saitama again.
Aw man, my muscles feel like pulp. Our daily\ntraining didn't leave much time for recovery.
Yeah, I'm the same.
Musta been tough, eh <avatar_name>?\nSorry you just got dropped into such an intense\nregimen.
How're you feeling? Any soreness or anything?
I'm good! I can handle it.
It's all to help me play better after all.
Unlike you old men, I'm still young and flexible.
Didn't you get hurt at practice?
Ha! Well said.
That's the spirit, rookie. Looking forward to see\nyou put it into practice on the field.
Gotta admire the optimism.
I hope some of that rubs off on the rest of the\nteam.
What? You were watching?
Don't fret. Once I get into the game,\nI won't even feel it!
If we stopped practice for every little scrape,\nwe'd never get anything done!
Old men... Pffft. We're only two years apart.
Well, make sure to save some of that young\nwhippersnapper energy for the matches.
The opening ceremony's about to start.\nLet's get ready.
Roger!
Roger!
Roger!
Roger!
Roger!
Roger!
The opening ceremony for the Junior Hero League\nsponsored by the Soccer Association will commence\nshortly.
Starting just this month, the best teams from\nNationals and even various Regionals have\ngathered. But this is no mere exhibition.
The goal of these games is that they will\ndetermine the players for the international\ntournament in America next month!
While the top schools facing off is one thing,\nindividual play will also be important. The top\nplayers are competing to represent our nation!
Who from among these teams will be chosen to\nstand as heroes representing all of Japan?
And here come the players now!
We made it in time... somehow.
I'm impressed you were able to organize this on\nsuch short notice.
You and me both.
It was only possible thanks to all the\nparticipating schools being so understanding.
I still can't believe the French International\nwas canceled and replaced with the\nJunior Youth World Challenge.
Plus the inclusion of even more ridiculously\nskilled teams from over the world.
The training camp... The European tour... All\nthose carefully laid plans just went up in smoke.
Indeed.
Every match is an opportunity for a player to\ngrow.
Exactly. That's why this\nJunior Hero League is so important.
Knowing that we're selecting players to rep Japan\nand that this isn't just an exhibition should\ninspire everyone to do their best.
Hopefully, the players can build on\nthe potential they showed at Nationals.
The Junior Hero League is a chance\nfor us to see their skill under pressure.
Then we will have succeeded in another objective,\nas well.
We will have aided them in developing the kind of\nskill it takes to compete on the world stage.
Yeah. But right now, it's really up to them.
Alright guys, the Junior Hero League is starting!
Our opponents are the best of the best.\nIf we wanna win this thing, we can't lose\na single match!
So no matter who we're up against, no matter if\nit's before breakfast or after dark, I want us\nfighting tooth and nail!
Furano soccer is gonna be what wins this!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
So this is your first match, <avatar_name>?\nNervous?
I am so ready to go.
I think my legs are going to run off without me.\nThey won't stop shaking...
I'm here with the team, so I'll be fine.
Ha! Nerves of steel. I'm glad you're watching my\nback.
With your skills, I'm sure you'll be fine.\nJust make sure you bring some of that enthusiasm\nand energy to the match.
Yeah? That's pretty normal.
But don't worry, you'll do great. And if anything\nhappens, we'll be there to back you up!
You are never alone out on that field.\nWe're a team.
As long as we help each other out, we'll\nwalk away winners. So stay confident!
Yo, Matsuyama.
Isn't this the first time we've played each other\nsince elementary school?
I guess so.
We may have lost back then, but things are\ndifferent today.
Both our teams have pretty much had the same\nmembers since then, too.
That being the case, how about we find out whose\nteam really plays as a team!
I was just thinking the same thing!
Listen up, <avatar_name>.
The league tournament is going to be the cream of\nthe crop. They're bringing in all the best teams\nfrom Nationals.
If you put on a good show here, there'll\nbe a lot of players out there taking notice.
It'll be a good opportunity to make some\ncontacts and deepen your connections.
A little rivalry with some top-notch players\nwill also doubtlessly push you to be your best.
Now, get out there!
Hear me out, <avatar_name>.
The league tournament is gonna be all killers, man.\nWe're talkin' all the best teams from Nationals.
If you put on a good show here, there'll be a lot\nof players out there taking notice.
It'll be a good opportunity to make some\ncontacts and deepen your connections.
A little rivalry with some top-notch players\nwill also doubtlessly push you to be your best.
Time to get out there!
You look like a first year.
But if you're good, you're good.
So don't expect us to use the kid gloves.
I was hoping you'd say something like that!\nThe gloves are off!
If I were you, I'd be more worried about how\nembarrassing it'll be when a first year kicks my\nbutt!
Don't expect me to hold back, either!
Ha! Aren't we cocky?
Meiwa Higashi doesn't play nice on the field.\nWhen we sense weakness, we strike.\nI hope you've adequately prepared yourself.
What?!
I don't care what age you are!\nPrepare to be crushed!
That's how Meiwa Higashi rolls! Be prepared!
Nothing wrong with a little confidence...
But Meiwa Higashi is about to smash that\nconfidence to pieces.
Agh! I can't believe our teamwork lost to theirs!
I hate to admit it, but we lost fair and square.\nYou guys really gel as a team.
We could learn a lot from you, too. You were no\nslouch.
There are still more matches in the league for\nboth of us. Good luck to you.
Yeah. Same.
...
Something wrong?
No, I was just thinking it'd be nice...\nif the old team were all here together.
Yeah...
<avatar_name>!
You've got a solid tackle.
You might even fit in on Meiwa's Sliding Squad.
It's a little upsetting how deftly you dodged our\nslides.
That dribble alone might qualify\nyou to rep Japan. Good luck!
You played pretty good out there.
Good luck in your next match!
Yo, Matsuyama.
Oh, Ishida and Takei.
Never thought we'd get a chance\nto pay you back so soon!
Time to repay you for knocking us out of\nNationals!
I'm pretty sure we're just gonna win again.
Tak! Get ready for the encore!
You put a first year in your starting lineup?\nGuess your team's been stretched a little thin.
You sure you can handle it out there?
Shut up!
Age doesn't matter in soccer!
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Are they really that much better...?
I think it's time someone taught you how real\nsoccer is played.
What's the matter, Ishida?\nYou look kinda... happy?
We'll see how long that confidence lasts.
Oh, um... Nice to meetcha.
Takei...
Fine, whatever. Time for you to learn a lesson\nfrom your elders.
Gah! Not just once, but twice?!
Are they really that much better...?
There's probably not much of a difference, player\nto player...
But as a whole, we're greater than the sum of our\nparts. That's our soccer.
Darnit, we'll win next time, Matsuyama!
Sure. Looking forward to it.
...
What's the matter, Ishida?\nYou look kinda... happy?
It's nothing, really. Just thinking I now know\nwhat I want to achieve come high school.
Yo, <avatar_name>!
To be honest, I'm shocked. Never saw\nmyself losing to a first year in technique.
But your talent's the real thing, kid.\nKeep at it from here on out!
You had some superb headers out there.\nReminds me of Takei in our first year.
I second that! Don't stop training.\nI'm expecting an epic header showdown someday.
You played pretty well out there today.
Make sure you stick around long enough\nthat we get another shot at taking you down.
Whew, that's it for practice.
Do we have permission to go out for the afternoon?
Yeah.\nEven Coach went to find a souvenir for his wife.
Alright! Then we should go hang out somewhere fun!
Count me in!
Can I bring the ball?
Actually, I've got homework...
Yeah, let's go!\nHow often do you get to hang out in a new city?
Plus, getting out and having some fun can\nhelp you concentrate later, in the real match.
Good point.\nYou need to take a breather every so often.
Come to think of it, some new cleats just came\nout. I wonder if they're selling them around here.
Seriously, Captain...?
Is soccer all you think about?
Please, shut up.
Huh? Sure... I guess.
You really love soccer, don't you?
That reminds me of back in elementary school when\nI used to dribble on the way to the grocery\nstore...
Me too! I used to just space out and juggle the\nball for hours.
Oh yeah, I guess I do, too.
Then we can just head home a little earlier.\nYou guys can all study after, right?
Sounds good to me. I'm in.
You too, huh?\nWell, I'm sure you'll manage if you do it tonight.
Tak! We can help you out too!
Ah!
What is it?
I forgot to bring any normal clothes...
What's wrong with the school uniform you wore on\nthe way here?
It'll look so lame if I'm the only one wearing my\nschool uniform.
C'mon, it can't make you any lamer than you\nalready are.
What was that?!
Hehehe...





Okay, let's go get changed.
Sounds good!
Okay!
Okay!
Okay!
Okay!
Okay!
So you're Matsuyama, huh? The Wild Eagle of\nHokkaido? Nice to meet you, I'm--
Shun Nitta, with the famous Falcon Shot, right?\nOf course, I've heard of you.
Oh, really? Good, that'll speed this up.
Today's match will be a brawl between Falcon and\nEagle.
Not that it'll be much a match while you're\nbeing shut down by the Otomo Quartet.
What'd you say?
I bet you're proud of being almost as good as\nTsubasa at holding on to the ball, but that isn't\nhappening today.
Ha!
Inconceivable!
C'mon Captain, they may have a Quartet, but we've\ngot a full eleven!
Yeah, for sure! Our squad fights together!
Pretty cocky for a team with a\nfirst year on their starting lineup.
But don't expect us to take it\neasy on ya just cuz you're a kid.
Yeah, you better keep track of your feet when\nyou've got the ball.
Because the Otomo Quartet will take both out from\nunder you!
Doesn't matter if there are four of you. You're\nnot slowing me down!
Then... I'll run away!
Pffft! Like I'll lose to four braggards\nfrom Otomo!
Hmph. Well, you certainly can run your mouth.
It's gonna be fun picking you apart!
Ha! Coward!
But no matter how far you run, you can't escape\nthe great Shun Nitta! Never forget that!
We aren't just any four players from Otomo!
We're the Quartet! We're greater than the Golden\nCombo or the Shutetsu Trio!
You heard him. Get our name right.\nWe're the Otomo Quartet!
We lost?! Seriously?
Heh, that's the Wild Eagle for ya.
Not on my own. I had my team behind me.
Oh well...
Good luck in your next match.
Yeah, you too.
Nitta, pay close attention to Matsuyama.
That's what it means to be captain of a\nnational-level team.
I will.
Yo, <avatar_name>!
That feint you pulled is something else.\nIt even faked out our Quartet.
You keep practicing, and soon no one will stand\nbetween you and the goal. I would like to see\nyou playing even better down the road.
I can't believe you outclassed Nitta in scoring.\nIt's hard to admit, but you've got a solid set of\nskills.
I'll see you next year at Nationals!\nDon't you dare quit between now and then!
You displayed pretty good instincts out there.
I won't lose next time.\nI expect a rematch next year!
Nice to finally meet you, Matsuyama.
I heard of you back in elementary\nschool, but this is the first time\nwe actually get to face off.
I guess you're right. And you're Hanawa's\nnotorious Tachibana brothers.
Furano may have solid teamwork, but you're still\nstuck on the ground.
Not even you'll be able to reach us in the sky!
Why would we need to?\nAll I have to do is stop your shot!
Come again?!
Hmph. I'd love to see you try.
Sorry Matsuyama, I shouldn't have sunk to their\nlevel.
It's fine. I mean, you're right. No matter what\nstunts they pull, we just gotta get between the\nball and the goal.
Though if we can help it, let's not\neven give them the chance.
Should they get a shot off, we're counting on\nyou, Kato!
I read ya loud and clear!
It doesn't matter how good of a player YOU are,\nsoccer's all about combination plays!
You see, as Japan's unrivaled combo, we're\nunstoppable!
I'm not going to lose to some combination play.
I can take you two on by myself!
So... Which of you is which again?
Oh? You think you can take on the brothers?
Oh, I like you. This'll be fun!
Oh, is that so?
Then let's see what you've got!
That's... is this really the time for that?
I mean, we're twins, so we look alike.
A-Anyway, just remember the numbers on our\njerseys!
Gah, that coulda gone better...
Jeez! This is so frustrating!
Are your legs holding up, you two?
Yeah, we're okay. We've been training a lot since\nNationals.
Now that you beat us, we expect you to definitely\nwin your next match, too.
See you later! I hope next time\nwe can meet as reps!
Let's both do our best, as fellow\nplayers from the land of ice and snow!
Thank you. Much appreciated.
Just for the record though, our\ncombo is still the best in Japan.
Furano made it this far as a team.
Yeah. We've never seen a team that worked so well\ntogether throughout. It's like they're psychic.
They really have an amazing team.
Yo, <avatar_name>!
That combination pass was out of this world!
Well, not as good as ours, of course, but still\npretty darned good!
I still can't believe you blocked our shot! I'm\nstill processing it.
Your defense is definitely good enough to rep\nJapan. Best of luck with your other matches!
Your play out there wasn't half bad.
And I'm willing to bet you can do even better!\nKeep it up!
If we put our hearts into this, we'll win big!
I'll lead the team to victory!
Well, you certainly seem reliable.
I'm countin' on that stout heart of yours!
And that's the game! Furano loses!
The addition of the promising player <avatar_name>\nto Furano will do little to further their teamwork\nif he runs off on his own!
If he doesn't mesh with Furano's team-defining\nteamwork, then he'll be a weak link!
Let's go all in and go home heroes!
Let's all do our best!
Yeah. Furano MS is all about teamwork.
I hope we can count on that strength of yours!
And that's the game! Furano loses!
Adding the promising new player <avatar_name> to\nFurano's outstanding teamwork doesn't help much\nif he can't see the bigger picture!
In the end, he ruined the rhythm\nand disrupted his own team's plays!
Let's work hard and win this thing together!
I'll give this everything I've got!
Yeah, soccer is all about hard work.
Looking forward to seeing you\ngive it everything you're got!
And that's the game! Furano loses!
Their teamwork gained new potency with\n<avatar_name>, but looks like the first-year\nplayer doesn't have all the needed experience.
The fact that hard work doesn't always pay off\nis one of the harsh truths of soccer...
Let's go all in and go home heroes!
This'll be a cinch with me here!
I like the confidence.
We don't really have anyone like you on the team,\nbut maybe that'll help kick us into gear.\nI have high hopes for you!
And that's the game! Furano loses!
Their outstanding teamwork gained new potency\nwith <avatar_name>, but as a first year player\nhe just doesn't have as much experience yet.
Adding the promising new player <avatar_name>\nto Furano's outstanding teamwork won't do much\ngood if he's too cocky!
He was clearly letting his guard down,\ngiving his opponents decisive openings!
Is... is this real?!
I need to train to make sure this can't happen!
There!
There!
Hey, you're pretty early. You're\nthe first one out here.
I had a dream that I failed the team.
Huh? Don't you mean second?
Why are you up so early, Captain?
...Yeah, that sure sounds like a nightmare.
But that's what practice is for.
What?
Oh, right, I forgot to count myself.
Eh, just had something on my mind.
Anyway, help me set up the field before everyone\nelse gets here.
We've won two games of the\nJunior Hero League so far.
But if we wanna win the whole kit and\ncaboodle, we can't start slowing down now.
And our three toughest opponents still remain:\nToho, Musashi, and Nankatsu.
To be blunt, I'm not sure we can beat them at our\ncurrent level.
That's not true!
Maybe you're right.
I mean, yeah, it's important to believe in\nourselves.
But we need more than that. There's\na skill gap we need to close.
Yeah. I guess so.
We've improved, but I'm sure they have too.
Toho has Hyuga, Musashi has Misugi, and Nankatsu\nhas Tsubasa. They're all prodigies.
But none of our players are stars like that. Not\neven me. I don't have the kind of talent they do.
But that's why all I can do to try to keep up is\nkeep pushing myself harder.
I mean, I'm expected to be the example as the\ncaptain, right?
You wouldn't follow me if I were apathetic or\nasleep on the job.
That's why I push myself and everyone else so\nhard. So we can win this time.
I have an idea. How about starting tomorrow you\nand I get up early and put in a few extra hours on\nthe pitch. I mean, if that's cool with you...
If we practice together, we should be\nable to make much greater strides.
Oh, you're already here, Captain?
Yes, I am. Alright guys, get changed! Time for\npractice.
On it!
On it!
On it!
On it!
On it!
On it!
So you must be Matsuyama.
Great deduction skills. And\nyou're the Ace Killer, Soda.
Ha! You even got my nickname right.
Furano may boast about its teamwork, but you're\nstill the main cog.
As long as I get you outta the\nway, your team will fall apart.
I think you'll find it isn't that easy.
You're gonna play right into our hands\nwhether you want to or not, and then\nwe're walking away with another win.
You might look like a first year...\nBut you can't fool me.
I'd bet my life that they brought you in as a\nringer.
You're about to learn why I'm called the Ace\nKiller!
Not if I get you first!
P-Please don't actually kill me!
Let's just have a good game.
I've heard that one a few times.
But I've yet to actually see it happen.
...Let me let you in on a little secret, kid.
The thing I loathe most of all... is a coward!
They'll hafta carry you off this field.
Aren't you the innocent little dum-dum.
On the pitch, winning is the only thing that\nmatters!
We did it, Captain!
Nice work, guys. That's three in a row!
We lost. I can't believe it...
You and I had a nice little stand off going, but\nthe rest of your team really got in there and\nclobbered mine.
You bet. We've been refining our\nteam dynamic from the time we were\nwee kiddies in elementary school.
Good luck with the rest of your matches!
No question, we're going to have a perfect record!
Since elementary school...
Must be nice to be able to play\nwith the same team for so long...
Ey, <avatar_name>!
Nice job getting past all my tackles.
You got a bit of that genius gene in your dribble.
Man, you tackle hard! You may be as good as me.
Keep polishing those tackles.
You've showed some flash out there, kiddo.
But don't let it go to your head. You've got a\nlong way to go. Keep pushin' yourself.
Yo, Matsuyama.
Jito!
Teamwork's all well 'n good, but s'not gonna save\nyou from gettin' squashed like bugs!
You heard 'im. Prepare yourselves!
Why would we need to prep?\nWe already know how you play.
But allow US to educate YOU about Furano soccer!
Chirp all ya like, lil crickets.
Captain, I think we need to bring this guy back\ndown to earth.
Sounds like a plan. Everyone, with me!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Ah, the already legendary first year kiddo.
I got a good instinct for people.\nComes from fightin'. I got a feelin' there's\nsomethin' special 'bout you.
Get ready to be goo beneath my feet!
You're the one who's gonna be crushed!
I'm not terribly interested.
Yeah, crush me! Cool!
Just like a yappy lil dog.
Perhaps my gut was wrong 'bout you.
Oh, ho! Guess ya can't be goaded into a one on\none. Smart.
Now ya made me hungry.
Your attitude gives me the distinct\nimpression, ya got a lotta grit for a lil guy.
Prob'ly means you're the best brawl m'gonna get.\nThat makes me ecstatic!
How about it, Jito?\nHow do you feel about Furano soccer now?
Hmph...
Hmph...
Ya do got a mite of moxie.\nCan't say I don't admire it.
Jito...
I believe it will. We're here to win!
Don't lose that spunk in the rest of your matches!
Hmmm?
...I s'pose Japan's bigger than I thought.
Up to now I was only interested in one man:\nTsubasa. But not anymore.
Now I know, there're more than a few good\nscuffles yet to be had out here on the pitch.
Ya made up for your age in skill. Ya beat me man\nto man.
Maybe someday we'll 'ave the chance to play fer\nthe same team. Wouldn't that be a trip.
You can really shoot. Ya rocked me harder\nthan any punch I've ever taken in a fight.
S'too bad we won't get this chance next year.\nWere we only closer in age...\nThree years is a long time.
You've got a ways to go, but ya got promise.
Dig deep. Find your drive... your inner beast!\nAnd let it out!
That was some nice shooting!\nYou've really developed a knack for this.
Well, everyone should just about be here. Let's\nget the pitch ready.
Seriously though, you've really thrown yourself\ninto training. I'm impressed.
But watch yourself. Don't get hurt.
You too, Captain.
Don't worry about me. I'm as solid as a rock.
Getting better is more important than worrying\nabout injuries.
Absolutely. I'm always careful.
I've got nothing if I can't get out there and run.
Hmmm. I suppose that might be a kind of talent.
This whole thing gives me some confidence, too.
You're right. Sometimes if you wanna get better,\nyou need to tough it out.
But an injury doesn't just affect you,\nit places a burden on the whole team.
Anyway, it's no time to discuss it now.
No matter what happens, I want us to win every\nlast game!
Why push so hard?
What do you mean, "want us to"?
Of course, who doesn't want to win?
Hmmm... It's difficult to put into words.
Hah, I guess you're right. No matter what\nhappens, we are going to win every last game!
That's good enough for now.\nYou're still a first year.
But someday, when you're a third year, you'll\nunderstand. It'll mean something different...\nSomething more.
Us third years at Furano have played together\nsince elementary school. The Nationals were going\nto be the end of our run together.
We did our best, we tried to win every match,\nbut we got knocked out in the semifinals. It's too\nbad we lost, but I've got no regrets about it.
I'd been thinking about how we'd all go our\nseparate ways after middle school. We'd all have\nour own paths to follow...
But then this tournament basically fell into our\nlaps, and now we have one more shot at a memory\nthat will last the rest of our lives!
But then some of us had to drop out of the team\nto study for exams or help our families, too.
We play for them, too.\nThey're a part of this memory.
That's why we have to win it all, no matter what.\nThat's why I'm going to do everything I can.\nThat's the choice I made.
We're in this until the last speck of dust\nsettles. We're going to prove we're the best. And\nthen we'll have our memory. Something to share.
Good morning, Captain!
Hey, you all made it!
Except Coach, it looks like he's gonna be late.
But hey, I heard he's bringing us some kinda\nspecial energy drink made from milk and honey.
Oh, that'll be good.
Alright, let's give it everything we've got!
Let's do it!
Let's do it!
Let's do it!
Let's do it!
Let's do it!
Let's do it!
Alright, let's polish these balls\nto a sparkle and finish up.
Hey, Cap, why don't you let us take care of that?
Yeah, you go on ahead.
But... I mean...
No, no, it's fine. You head on back.\nTake a load off for Pete's sake.
Uh, okay, I guess...
Alright, 'til tomorrow then.
Hey, got a sec?
It's about the Captain...\nHe's been acting a little funny.
I mean he's always been a really dedicated player.
But it's not the same this time.\nSomething's different somehow.
We've known him a long time so we can sorta tell.
So, hey... You've been hanging out with the\nCaptain a lot lately, right?
So did something happen?\nDid he mention anything to you?
Actually...
There was something.
...So that's the deal?
He's shouldering that whole burden.\nFor us, for the guys who had to drop out...
That's just like him, really.
...
Listen, everyone, I've got an idea...
Sorry, one sec.
It's Yamamuro... What does he want?
Yo, Yamamuro, what's goin' on?
Ah, Kaneda, well ya see...
...Wha?! Really?
The following morning.
Huh? What is this?
G'morning, Captain!
You guys... what're you doing here so early?
What're we doing? You got eyes, don't you?\nWe're doing morning drills.
We may lack your talent, Captain, but we figured\nwe could make up for it by getting started\nearlier!
We heard why you've been driving\nyourself so hard lately, Captain...\nwith the early mornings and late evenings.
Yeah. And we feel the same as you, Captain.
...
Captain!
Yamamuro!
And Matsuda and Kondo!\nWhat in the world are you guys doing here?
I couldn't focus on studying while I was worrying\nabout the team, so I didn't really have any other\nchoice.
Me too. I figure, it's better to see this through\nfirst. Then, I can focus on exams.
I told my parents helping out would have to wait\nuntil after the tournament. They didn't love the\nidea, but I think they're coming around.
I'm tired of them treating me like a kid, and\nalso expecting me to work on the farm, anyway.
And plus...
We can't let the new guy outshine us!
It's so awesome you guys are here!
And hey, as an added bonus, I picked up a special\ntechnique while studying for my exams.
Ever heard of General Han Xin?
Han who?
He used something like an evolution of the\nAvalanche Attack. It's like the ultimate counter!\nHow to fight with your back to the wall.
I heard about this! That could indeed come in\nhandy. I mean we're kinda a defensive team anyway.\nWho knew history was useful?
We're up against Toho next. Facing off\nwith Hyuga, Sorimachi, and Sawada means\nour defense is gonna be under a lot of pressure.
I don't think our usual attacks will get far with\nWakashimazu in front of the net.
So what we do is, we let them get deep in our\nbackfield, then throw everyone at them in one\nall-out offensive when the moment's just right!
It's riskier than the Avalanche Attack because\neveryone pushes forward, but if we do it right, we\ncan overwhelm them!
Even with Wakashimazu in goal, he can't take us\nall on.
We all have to be alert and ready, watching for\nthe right moment to shift from defense to offense.\nThen, we all need to move as one.
That's why this team... why ONLY this team could\npossibly pull it off!
I'm speechless... I can't believe how dedicated\neveryone is to helping the team.
Hey, give us some credit.
I mean, we are a team. That means it's our team,\ntoo, you know!
It's all or nothin', Cap!
That's right.
Okay then, let's practice formation.
We're short on time, so get focused fast, and\nlet's put this together.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Oh, one more thing. Dad gave me a bunch of steak\nfrom the farm. Tonight we feast, boys!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Now, let's do this right!
Okay! That's enough practice for today!
Phew... I'm beat.
C'mon, we've still gotta get everything picked up.
Oh, right...
Working hard as usual, huh, <avatar_name>?\nKeep it up!
You're a hard worker, too!
I can keep going!
Finally... the time has come. The time for meat!
Man, "work" is right.\nMatsuyama's been driving us like cattle all day.
But now's the best part! Dinner!\nThe meat from Kondo's place is to die for!
Whoa, do you ever rest?\nI can barely lift my head, let alone move my legs.
Ha! Don't tell me you've been\nfantasizing about steak all day?
...
What's wrong, Yamamuro?
Man, I'm gone for a minute and\nthe whole team improves this much?
Yeah. Our teamwork's getting better...\nBut even the mood's sunnier than usual.
I've been thinkin', too... Practice has been even\nmore fun than it was before the summer tournament.
You think so, too?
Oh hey, Captain.
I agree that the team's coming\ntogether stronger than ever.
It's all thanks to <avatar_name>, eh?
While he was trying hard to fit in with us, we\nrealized we needed to put forth an effort, too.
Yeah, he's doing his best to fill the holes left\nby Yamamuro and the others. He's really stepped\nup in practice and matches.
Now that you mention it, today's practice was...
Of course, that doesn't mean he can\nreplace you guys. It just means we have\nanother teammate we can count on.
Okay! Then, I think <avatar_name>\nhas earned one of the best cuts!
Hey, aren't we going to decide fair\nand square with rock paper scissors?
C'mon! We never gave <avatar_name>\na welcome party, so why not?
Nah. But I'm sure getting hungry, too...
He could form the core of our teamwork.
Alright guys, today we're splitting\ninto two teams to practice our teamwork!
Chase those dribbles and tackles,\nand try to raise team morale!
We're starting!
And we're done!
You did pretty well back there, <avatar_name>!
Keep that up in a real match and you'll do fine!
Are you sure you're taking this seriously,\n<avatar_name>? I know you can do better\nthan that!
Okay, we'll take a little break before we\nmove on to the next training exercise.
Alright guys, today we're splitting into two teams\nto practice our teamwork!
Chase those dribbles and tackles, and try to raise\nteam morale!
We're starting!
And we're done!
You really put on a show out there!
Keep that up in a real match and you'll do fine!
Are you taking this seriously,<avatar_name>?\nI know you can do better than that!
Okay, we'll take a little break before we move on\nto the next training exercise.
Good to finally meet you on the pitch, Hyuga.
Hello, Matsuyama.
Back at the Nationals, Furano had two goals.\nThe first was to beat Nankatsu.
The second was to defeat you and the rest of the\nToho team in the final.
This isn't exactly what the game plan was, but\nI'm glad we're getting to play against Toho today.
Matsuyama, I saw your fighting spirit at\nNationals. You leave little room for doubt as to\nyour Viking heart.
But warrior though you may be, that will not be\nenough to defeat me here.
And our team's strength united will not be broken\nby you and yours.
So you see, today we will return to our beds\nvictorious!
You sound awfully certain. But I think we'll\nhave to show you a few new tricks!
On the pitch, it's do or die.\nThat's what I believe.
Ready yourself in whatever way you can.\nI will not show restraint.
Time to cage the tiger!
Let's just have a good game.
Yo, Takeshi! It's game time!
Nice to see you came ready...\nat least with clever banter.
So be it! My Tiger Shot will rip you to shreds!
You mean to stand toe to toe, eye to eye with me?\nWhat resolve.
Very well, then!\nLet me show you what true skill looks like.
Wait, wha--me?!
...Pretty bold just ignoring me.
Foolish to have made me angry, though!
How could we possibly lose...?
How did we mess up after winning at Nationals?
Hyuga. Wakashimazu.
Matsuyama.
Consider this a debt paid from our elementary\nschool days.
We'll have to return the favor, someday.
Let me make you a promise. In high school, you'll\nbe repaid in full.
I can't wait!
Hey, <avatar_name>!
You really have a tremendous shot.
Yeah, normally no one gets more\nthan a single goal past me.
If you keep playing like you have been, we may\nyet meet again as players representing Japan.
You stopped my movement down field with the ball\ncold so many times. Can't say I'm used to that.
You could be on the All-Japan team with your\nskill. Keep it up!
You got a ways to go, but you've got heart.\nI can't deny that.
You're only in your first year, too? I guess we\nboth have some work to do from here on out.
We've got Musashi next.
Misugi's team... That guy's a genius.
Alright, everybody, huddle up.\nWe have some gameplay video to watch.
...
WHAT! Did you see that bicycle kick?
That he connected at all is amazing, but did you\nsee how he put it toward the corner of the net?
Not even that, look at the dribbles, the feints!\nThere's no way any of us could mark him alone.
And his shot calling! Everyone's listening and\ntaking action immediately.
I'd heard he'd had heart problems during Tokyo\nRegionals, but you'd never guess it watching this\nvideo.
Okay, Captain. What do you think of\nMusashi Middle School's strengths?
Let me think for a moment... We're probably about\neven in terms of working together on the field.
That means it's gonna come down to duking it out\nmidfield with Misugi.
(Which I assume is my responsibility.)
(But how do you do it Misugi? How are you able to\nplay so well even with the medical supervision\nyou're under and that bum ticker?)
(Maybe I don't have the same level of natural\ntalent, but my courage and hard work have carried\nme this far.)
(But how far can hard work take me against a\nnatural born player of the game?)
There's no victory for the faint of heart, Cap!
Have some faith in your teammates!
Teamwork will never let you down!
How can you have such little faith in your team?
Talent does not trump training.
He's just one guy.
You... Why...?
My team... Oh!
Of course!\nI get it now!
What did you say?!
What!?
One guy...?
That's right, Captain! Just think of\nall the hours we've put in on the field.
Genius... prodigy... they can call him whatever\nthey want. Misugi is no match for all of us.
Let's hold our heads and play our game, Captain!
Soccer's about teams, and we're the best team\nplayers in Japan!
We'll prove it when we rout Musashi.
I couldn't ask for a better team...
You're right. We can count on each other.
That's right!
That's right!
That's right!
That's right!
That's right!
That's right!
I just kinda noticed this, but Musashi's\ngot quite a few girls up in their stands.
You think they're all here for Misugi?
I don't even think we have that many female fans\nwith all of us combined.
Speak for yourself...
It's great that our captain has\nFujisawa there for him, huh.
Yeah, so lucky.
Hey guys, can you not do this right now?
Ha ha ha!





...Dunderheads. Stay focused!
Hey Captain, what's the problem? She IS here,\nafter all. And we have a good guess as to why.
Et tu, Oda?
(Sometimes I swear these guys are barely above\nbarnyard animals.)
(Oh well, they're still my team. I still owe 'em\nfor a good deal of my good fortune.)
(The next match is Furano against Musashi. It's\nnot Matsuyama vs. Misugi.)
(It's time for me to step up as Furano's captain.\nIt's going to take every one of us working\ntogether to take this game from Musashi.)
Misugi, I took a look at some of your replays.\nWould've never guessed your heart wasn't up to\nsnuff.
Mhmmm. No concern needed.
Good, I'm glad.
Means I'm not pulling any punches today.
It wouldn't be like you to do so anyway.
Oh, you've been scoping me out, too?
That makes sense. Then you know it doesn't\nmatter who... it's all or nothing with me.\nLet's make it a clean match.
That's all I would ask for.\nSee you on the pitch, Matsuyama!
Bring it! When this is over, Furano's going to be\nat the top of the heap.
I've done some research on your game.\nI get the feeling this is going to be an\ninteresting endeavor.
You'll still lose, of course.
I look forward to seeing your so-called\ngenius-level soccer.
I'll plow right through you if I have to!
Is your heart really okay?
...I'd rather you not call it that.
I put all of myself into my game. My ability to\nwin wasn't some gift I was freely given.
Good! Don't turn tail when we reach the pitch.
Be ready because the gloves are always off with\nme!
I appreciate the concern, but you won't win with\nthat sheepish attitude.
We did it, Captain! We won!
Now there's just one more game, and we win it all!
You guys were fantastic out there! We're only one\naway from a dream come true!
You got me, Matsuyama.\nYou were too good for me this time.
You're wrong about that, Misugi.
What...?
It wasn't me. It was Furano that beat you.\nIt was my team that won.
Heh... The words of a true captain.
Congratulations again, Furano. Hope you can keep\nit up against Nankatsu in the finals.
After facing you today, I have a good feeling\nabout your chances.
Hey, thanks.
(Furano and Matsuyama's strength... that's all\npure blood, sweat, and tears.)
(It's time for me to make that level of\ncommitment, and fight through this condition of\nmine!)
(But there are still many battles to fight. Wars\nto wage... Matsuyama, Hyuga, and of course,\nTsubasa!)
<avatar_name>!
To be honest, your defense is surprisingly good.\nOther teams don't normally keep me from going\nwherever I want to.
Looks like I'm still a little sloppy. Thank you\nfor the lesson.
That was a really fun one-on-one, even if I came\nup short.
Can't say when we'll have the chance, but let's\nhave a rematch one day.
Your a little rough around the edges, but you\nhave a definite flair for the beautiful game.
You must get out there and try harder. You've too\nmuch potential to waste it.
It's time, everyone. Nankatsu's up next.
We all know how good they are firsthand from when\nthey shamed us at Nationals.
But we're not the same Furano today we were then.\nWe're up in the stratosphere now!
Isn't that right, guys?
That's right!
That's right!
That's right!
That's right!
That's right!
That's right!
Guys, this is also truly our last time out on the\nfield together as Furano.
We're gonna dig deep and remember our friendship,\nour teamwork, and all the experiences we've had\ntogether from elementary school to now...
and use it to win this final match!
Alright, let's do this!
Let's give 'em the fight of their lives!
Nothing but the best Furano soccer!
Okay, now let me hear your war cry!
Everything for today!
Get ready for a brawl, Nankatsu!
We are as one!
Simple... But that's what it should be.
That's it! No fear here. Let them fear us.
Perfect! That's the Furano way!
Okay, everyone. Nankatsu awaits, time to build\nsome muscle!
This ends with us smiling and passing around one\nmassive trophy!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Okay, we're splitting up into two teams again!
Keep the ball in your team's possession as long\nas possible! Use footwork and tackles to win!
3, 2, 1... Go!
Alright! We're done!
That was great, <avatar_name>!\nYou've really amped up your game!
Bring that heat when we hit\nthe field for a real match!
You can do better, <avatar_name>!
There's still time before our final match\nof the league. Push yourself even harder!
Okay, we'll take a little break before we\nmove on to the next training exercise.

Under this azure summer sky, the day has finally\ncome.
Two teams will take the field, but only one will\nbe crowned champion of the Junior Hero League!\nWill it be Nankatsu or Furano?
Nankatsu is a powerhouse among middle school\nteams, recently taking home a third straight\nNational championship title!
Nankatsu's captain, Tsubasa Ozora, seems to\nhave recovered from his injuries at Nationals.
Their opponents, Furano MS, fell to them at\nNationals, but still delivered an unforgettable\nperformance and advanced to the final four.
Nearly their entire side of eleven has been\ntogether since elementary school, building what is\narguably Japan's most coordinated team.
And what's more, Furano is joined by a wild card\nfirst year player, who has played a key role in\nthe team's success in this league!
This will decide the ultimate, the best\nof the best, among the middle school teams!
But don't be fooled into thinking this is just\nany match! The winners will be the top team\nin the league! These are the league finals!
Furano or Nankatsu... Only one can come\nout on top as Japan's New Heroes!
It's almost time for the opening whistle, folks!
Tsubasa, it's our turn, today. We're winning this.
I can't let you do that, Matsuyama.
That's right. This'll be different than the\nsemifinal with Tsubasa now at his best!
Well, guess you've gotten stronger since\nNationals.
But you're not the only ones!
Furano's reached new heights since the start of\nthis league!
And we're going to use every ounce of what we've\ngained to win.
Kid, I've taken a good look at your work so far.
I'm glad we get to play one another\nthanks to this new league.
This is it, let's make it a good one!
Yeah, good luck, have fun!
Once I beat you, I'll be number one in Japan!
Ha! As if you could ever be my rival!
Back at ya. I can't wait!
That's what I like to hear. Bring it on.
It is not my fate to lose today!
I admire the confidence. Maybe you're the rival\nI'VE been looking for.
We're going to have fun on the field.
Hailing from Hokkaido, Furano MS maintains a\nperfect record and takes home the\nJunior Hero League championship title!
How... could I lose...?
This is just...
You guys, we did it! We won!
Captain! We really pulled it off!
Is this real? Someone tell me this isn't a dream!
Nope, this isn't a dream!
Holy cow... How did we manage to defeat all those\ntop notch schools...
Stop crying, Kaneda! Ya big baby! You're...\nyou're gonna make me cry too!
Let it out!
It's time for laughter!
Woohoo!
Right, yeah. This is the kind of time when it's\nokay to cry.
We poured our hearts into this, didn't we!
I mean I'm smiling... I'm laughing... it's just...
It's just I can't hold back the tears for some\nreason.
What kind of reaction is that!
I guess at a time like this... I guess you're\ngonna do your own thing.
Guys, listen up.
What is it, Captain?
Y'know, since I was back in elementary, I've\ntried to hold us all together as captain.
...at least, that's what I thought.
Turns out, it was you guys who kept this team\ntogether. You carried me.
It's because of you all that I could push myself\nfar beyond what I ever thought possible.
Captain...
Thank you, really. Truly. For everything.
I couldn't have asked for better teammates...
Or a better team!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Matsuyama.
Hey, Tsubasa.
...
What's up?
Nah, just...
Look, when we dominated all three years at\nNationals, I figured I was done with Japan. I was\ngoing to move to Brazil and go pro...
At least, that's what I thought.
But the way you handled the ball out on the\nfield... I realized I've just been coasting.
You Furano guys, you're a tough bunch. You\nand all of the rest of them... when you stand\ntogether, nothing can stop you.
I've been slacking. I got in my own head to where\nI thought it didn't matter who I faced, I'd always\nwin.
Tsubasa...
Thanks, Matsuyama. You and your team pulled me\nback to reality.
I love this game, and I have no plans to go on\nlosing. It's time to put my ego aside and put my\nheart back into it.
Anyway, congrats, Matsuyama. You and\nFurano were something else out there.
Tsubasa...!
Hey, <avatar_name>!
Going toe-to-toe with me... I honestly didn't\nthink you had it in you. But you showed me.
And I haven't had that much fun in a long time!\nYou owe me a rematch someday.
I have decent dribble I think, but you have some\nserious moves.
I can't believe this. How did we let\nourselves get steamrolled like that!
I'm glad you weren't at Nationals.
It's not hard to see you've got the love for the\ngame, too.
It's time for us to go our separate ways, but I\nknow you'll keep playing with every ounce of your\nbeing, just like me.
Thanks to all teams who participated\nin this exhibition tournament!\nThe Junior Hero League is now over.
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament: Somehow, it's the\nnewcomer from Furano, <avatar_name>!
He shot through this league like a comet!\nHe is truly the "Junior Hero!"
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament: It's the newcomer\nfrom Furano, <avatar_name>!
Not only that, but he's the top scorer\nof the match. A double victory!
He shot through this league like a comet!\nHe is truly the "Junior Hero!"
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament: Furano's Captain\nHikaru Matsuyama! What a marvelous captain!
And the top-scoring player of the tournament,\nis the newcomer from Furano,\n<avatar_name>!
He's earned recognition for upsetting opposing\nstrikers, which is all the more impressive!
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament: Furano's Captain\nHikaru Matsuyama! What a marvelous captain!
Also from Furano MS, the incredible <avatar_name>!
We would like to recognize twenty-one\nincredible players from the Junior Hero League!
From Furano MS,\nMatsuyama and <avatar_name>!
These twenty-one players will travel to\nthe United States to represent Japan\nin international competition.
Watch out for this new generation of players!\nThey will show the world what Japan can really do!
Thank you all for coming. My name is\nMikami, and I will be coaching the\nAll Japan Junior Youth team.
Next month is the Junior Youth World Challenge\ntournament in America.
Each of you has been specifically chosen to join\nthe team Japan is sending to that tournament.
Wait, really?! I'm going to America to represent\nJapan?
Exactly.
I get to represent Japan! I would've never\ndreamed...
Starting in three days, you're going to be housed\ntogether as a team. Settle whatever other affairs\nyou may have and get ready by then.
Members of the Soccer Association\nwill explain the rest.
That's all I have to tell you for now.
I don't believe we've met.
My name is Katagiri. I'm from the Japan Soccer\nAssociation.
You should know, I'm the one who recommended you\nplay for Japan.
Thank you.
But why?
Got a pretty good eye for talent, don't ya?
No thanks are needed.
"Why"?
You must be pulling my leg.
Well, I suppose that's my job...
Your performance in the Junior Hero League\nwas quite remarkable. I think it's clear that\nyou're All-Japan material.
However, some in the Association are\nraising objections to you representing us.
Unlike Sawada or Nitta, you've only had this one\ntournament to show your skill. They think it's\nrash to select a first year based on just this.
But your performance today isn't why I scouted\nyou.
I can sense an incredible talent\nlying within you, trying to burst out.
I'm talking about a level of talent\nthat rivals even Tsubasa Ozora.
One reason the Junior Hero League was made was to\npit great schools against one another, so they\ncould grow together. Then we'd pick the players.
Another reason was to discover our "New Heroes."\nSkilled players that were perhaps overlooked at\nNationals...
Players like you.
It's a big world out there.
And Japan has a crop of players worthy of being\ncalled the Golden Generation. But, even they will\nstruggle against the world's best athletes.
But I'm confident that if stars like Tsubasa\nOzora, Kojiro Hyuga, and now you, can band\ntogether and hone your skills...
You will blaze a path that will bend the tide of\nhistory.
Well... I have other business to attend to. I'm\nlooking forward to seeing you on the All-Japan\nteam.
We made it! We really made it!
Ah man, I can't think of a better way for this to\nend.
It's 'cause you said we were\ngonna win this together, Captain.
Tak! Thanks for everything, Captain!
Come on! I might've said it, but you're the ones\nwho made it a reality. I should be thanking you.
Still, the one who's been working\nhardest would have to be...
I think it must be you.
Yeah, I agree.
The way you push the team\nhas really helped us out.
The way you show concern for everyone\nadds so much to the solidarity of our team.
The way you're always giving it your all\nis an inspiration to the rest of us.
The way you never lose your confidence\ngives us hope when the skies are gray.
You're an even harder worker than I thought.
It must've been tough to join the team as the\nonly younger kid and a transfer student at that...
But you've worked so hard that you're pushing us\nto improve, too. Can't let the new guy show us up,\nafter all.
I don't wanna be sappy about it,\nbut I do wanna thank you again.\nYou're a great addition to the team.
Yeah. It's thanks to you that we now\nhave all these amazing experiences.
It doesn't matter where you're from,\nyou've got that Furano spirit!
Hey, <avatar_name>!
We're all really happy you made the team, too.
Furano's a better team thanks to you. I really\nmean that.
Yeah, and we have some amazing memories thanks in\npart to you, too!
We've only known each other a short while, but I\nhad a lotta fun out there on the field together.
I mean there was more than just soccer. Don't\nforget hanging out and all the great times we had!
You've worked hard to make\nit this far, <avatar_name>.
It must've been tough to join the team as the only\nyounger kid... And a transfer student at that.
Yeah. Your hard work has really set\nan example for the rest of the team.
Thanks, <avatar_name>!
You're just as much a part\nof this team as any of us!
Don't forget to take some time\nfor stuff other than soccer, too!
It's the end of the line for us third years.
Furano soccer is about the bond... the trust we\nall have in each other.
We got to fight the good fight together, and now\nyou know better than anyone the strength we share.
Now there's a heavy burden for you to bear.\nYou've gotta share that spirit with the rest\nof 'em! We're all counting on you.
You can absolutely count on me!
I'll do my best!
I hope I'm up for it...
I know you can. You've got the Furano spirit!
That's the right attitude! Stick to that and\nyou'll really go places.
Don't you worry, you've got this. We believe in\nyou, even if you're not so sure yourself, yet.
So you and Captain are gonna be bunking together\nfor the All-Japan team, right?
Remember you're representing us, too!
We're all rootin' for ya!
And hey, bring us back something from the States!
C'mon, what's the matter? Already out of gas?
If you're already worn out from a little heat, how\ndo you expect us to get to Nationals next year?
When you're getting tired the other team will be\ngetting tired, too! That's when you need to grit\nyour teeth and push yourselves harder!
Un-Understood!
Okay, then we'll take a break.\nGet some water and be ready for the next set!
Okay!
Hey guys! Thanks for looking after the rookies.
Masao! Kazuo!
We came as soon as we heard about the clubroom\ncleanup. Are we early?
Didn't you hurt your legs using Skylab Hurricane?\nYou okay?
Yeah, we're fine. We got plenty of rest.
What's that noise?
What the...? Is that guy trying to jump off\nthe goalpost? Is he doing our Triangle Shot?
Oh, <avatar_name>? He's been at it a lot lately.
From what I've seen, his kicks off the post\nand jump timing aren't half-bad.\nHe might have potential.
I heard him say that he came to Hanawa MS\nbecause he looked up to you guys.
Yeah, he was going on about our two-man combo's\nawesome plays.
I mean, I can understand that sentiment.
I know, right? Especially, that Triangle Shot!\nI used to work on it on my own, too!
Who didn't? Never managed to pull it off though.
Masao and Kazuo make it look easy,\nbut it's about as easy as taming a lion.
Darn right it is. We contributed a heckuva lot to\nadding it to the arsenal, ourselves.
Ishizaki may have ruined it, but that's where it\nall started for us. Brings back memories...
Anyway, we were about to split into teams for\na practice match.\nIf you're feeling up for it, wanna join us?
You don't mind?
Not a bit. We'll hafta start cleaning up the\nclubroom after this, though.
I mean, you'd get bored just watching,\nwouldn't you? Come play!
Oh, you're on! You wouldn't believe how much we've\nbeen itching to play, ever since we watched\nNationals.
Alright then! Let's make teams!
Hey, <avatar_name>! Nice moves!\nWhen did you get so good?
You've got the reflexes, so if you polish your\nskills a little, you could be a starter in no\ntime flat!
Okay, the practice match is over!\nTime to get to scrubbin'!
Ow ow ow...
Hurt yourself, Murasawa?
Yeah... Scraped my knee last game.\nI'm gonna head to the nurse's office.
Okay. Then, we'll start cleaning without you.
I can't believe we're already saying goodbye\nto this old clubroom.
We must've come here every single day,\nsince we started middle school.
Yeah, and that includes weekends. I'm sure we've\nspent more time here than in classes.
Heck, I'd come here even when we didn't have\npractice, just to hang out with you guys.
So much has happened since I first joined\nthe club.
But what sticks out the most...
Has gotta be the Skylab Hurricane.
Seriously. I'll never forget that whole process.\nWhen I first heard you guys float the idea I was\nlike "what?!"
Well, it is kind of a bonkers technique,\nI'll give you that.
Still, you practiced like madmen until it clicked.\nYou two are incredible.
We were desperate.
Here we go, Kazuo! Skylab Hurricane!
Sure thing, Masao!
Ngh!
Oof!
Oh, that stings...
Ouch! My leg!
C'mon, guys, you'll never pull this off.\nIt's impossible.
Yeah, linking your feet together to get more\nairtime sounds cool and all, but...
Keep this up and you'll be too injured to play at\nNationals!
But we have to do this! How else is Hanawa going\nto win at Nationals?
Tak! When Nankatsu's got a monster like Tsubasa,\nwe need a secret weapon!
Masao... Kazuo...
We already lost to him in elementary school,\nI think it's our turn to hold the trophy.
We all share the same dream, so we'll do whatever\nit takes to make it come true!
Daimaru! One more time!\nSend it our way one more time!
Um, but...
We don't have any time to waste with\nNationals right around the corner!\nThis is an order from your captain, Daimaru!
Please, Daimaru!
Okay... Your enthusiasm must be rubbing off on me!
Here it comes!
This is the one!
Skylab Hurricane!
In the end it wasn't enough, but we did everything\nwe could. No regrets.
Right. No regrets...
Something still bothering you, Ono?
Nah. I gave it my all against Nankatsu too,\nso I've nothing to feel bad about.
It's just... I'm gonna miss playing with you guys.
Ono...
He's not the only one.
You two have some of the sickest combinations out\nthere. So, you know, it was fun.\nBeing on this team with you.
Obviously I'm gonna keep playing soccer in high\nschool, but without your high-flying moves it\nwon't be the same.
It's a bit of a bummer.
Daimaru and Aimoto are right.\nI'm sure everyone in the club feels the same.
Everyone...
H-Hey, big news guys!
"Junior Hero League"?
Y-Yeah.
When I was leaving the nurse's office,\nI ran into the coach, and that's what he told me.
There's supposed to be a qualifier to decide who\ngets to represent Japan at the big tournament in\nAmerica next month.
He got a call from the Soccer Association,\nand they said Hanawa MS is going!
So it's a bunch of exhibition matches?
You think they'll let us third years play, too?
Why wouldn't they?\nI heard anyone could play, regardless of year.
For real?!
Which means it's not over yet!\nWe're still fighting as a team a little longer!
Hey, that's right!
Heh. Here we were talking about the end of an era,\nand as it turns out, we're not through yet!
Hey, Murasawa, did you hear about what other teams\nwould be playing?
I knew you'd ask, so I had the coach make a list.
Ta-da!
Good job, Murasawa!
Okay, let's see here...
Okay... So... There are 14 teams total,\ndivided into groups of 7 teams each.
So which schools are in our group?
Well... Nankatsu, Toho Academy, Musashi...
That's crazy! Those are all killer teams!
They probably matched up teams with similar skill\nlevels to help choose the reps.
Which means we're in the running!
Masao...
Right here with ya, Kazuo.
Hey, guys?
Hmm?
This isn't Nationals, but...\nHow do you feel about maybe winning this thing?
The whole event?!
Yeah. Every single match.
I know we said we had no regrets about losing\nto Nankatsu.
But that doesn't mean it wouldn't have been nice\nto win. I mean, we wanted to win the\ntournament, right?
And now we're in the same group as the winners,\nNankatsu and Toho. And all the other big shots,\ntoo.
Which means this is our chance. Even if it's just\nan exhibition, we can beat all of 'em and prove\nourselves!
Isn't that just as good as winning at Nationals?
You know what, you're right!
There'll even be six matches in the league,\nthe same as at Nationals!
And most of all, who wouldn't wanna end our time\nin the club together as winners?
So how about it, guys? You with us?
You know it!
Heh heh! So the goal is to beat all the best\nteams? Sounds like fun to me!
It's a tall order, but it's the right call\nfor sure!
Let's make this a tournament we'll never forget!
Alright then! We're all on the same page!
Let's work our butts off and win this thing!
All the way!
Hmm... Looking back at the video of our game\nagainst Nankatsu at Nationals, we were so close.
Not being able to pull of a Skylab at the crucial\nmoment is what sunk us.
Yeah. If we'd gotten off another Skylab Hurricane\nwhen we had the chance, we could've had that game\nin the bag.
Or if we'd blocked Tsubasa's last shot with a\nSkylab block, we could've won with a penalty kick.
...
But while you two were performing your miracles,\nNankatsu was running roughshod over the rest of\nus.
Heck, if we hadn't let Taki or Kisugi make\nthose goals, you two wouldn't have had to push\nyourselves so hard.
And with the lineup we're facing this time, every\nsingle game is likely to be a nailbiter like that.
What we're saying is that if we wanna win,\nwe can't just let you guys break your backs\ncarrying the team.
Sure, but we also need to toughen up our legs,\nso we can use the Skylab more often.
We need to look for a better way of doing it\nthat puts less strain on us.
So, we've all got our own stuff to work on.\nSounds good to me!
Yeah. When the opposing team advances on us,\nwe'll be ready to steal the momentum from them.
And I need more than just kicking power\nif I wanna properly contribute to the team.
Actually, I was thinking...
Yeah?
I mean, Ono's right, we all need to improve.
But how about we also add some new players to\nthe lineup? Get some new talent in here.
Like, with another forward, our offense would be\nmore than just the Tachibana brothers' variety\nhour. That'd put more pressure on their defense.
Not only would that smooth out our matches,\nit'd put less burden on you two to keep pumping\nout those Skylabs.
Like, with another midfielder,\nwe could dominate the center of the field.\nThat'd help on both offense and defense.
If we had good enough positioning, we could give\nyou two some time for your legs to rest, too.
Like, if we had another defender, we could tighten\nup our defense, freeing up Masao and Kazuo on\noffense.
If you think about it, that's another way to take\nsome burden off your legs from pumping out those\nSkylabs, too.
Makes sense.
If we already gave it everything we had and lost,\nthen we'll need more than we had before.
So... How about <avatar_name> then?
<avatar_name>?
Yeah.
I'm on reserve, so I've seen him in practice a\nlot. He's definitely the best of the younger guys.
I guess he has improved a good bit since he first\njoined. I could tell in from the practice match.
We were too focused on mastering the Skylab by\nNationals to pay much attention to anyone else,\nbut seems like he's put in the effort.
Yeah, he's one of the hardest workers here easily.
But that's not the only reason I'm recommending\nhim.
Yeah?
It's 'cause he joined the team because he looked\nup to you two.
I figure if he got to play alongside his heroes,\nhe'd be more motivated than ever.
I think there's more to 'im. I wanna see what\nhe can really do.
Yeah. With the right motivation,\nyou can kill giants, right?
Daimaru, I am thoroughly impressed.\nYou've really thought this one through.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Hey, I agree with you! I feel like putting\n<avatar_name> on the team is gonna shake things\nup around here in a good way.
Well, we should probably go talk to him then.
Hey, you got a minute, <avatar_name>?
Absolutely! What's up?
Finally recognized my talent?
Wh-What is it?!
You're making me a starter?!
Uh... yeah. Good to see you so chipper.
He must be happy that you two are talking to him.
Wow, someone's sure of himself.
But I kinda like that!
Hey now, relax. Don't be scared. We don't bite.
(I knew he admired the Tachibanas,\nbut I didn't think he'd get so nervous.)
Uh... wow. Way to jump to conclusions.\nSettle down, man.
You're more cocky than I thought.
Anyway...
So here's the deal... They're holding a new\ntournament, and naturally we wanna win.\nBut we need to strengthen our starting lineup.
We thought you could help us with that.\nDaimaru and the others vouched for you,\nand you did pretty well in that practice match.
So starting tomorrow, you'll be training\nalongside the regulars.
It'll be tougher than what you've been doing so\nfar, but if you can rough it out you might make\nregular.
I'll follow you two anywhere!
I'll do my best!
No one's more motivated than me!
Time to unleash our three-piece combo!
That's what I'm talking about!\nBut it won't be easy!
Don't be so nervous! You'll be fine!
Looking forward to it!
Sounds pretty fun... if you can pull it off.
First, you'll have to keep up with us in training!
Anyway, don't be shy just 'cause you're younger\nthan us. If you need something, just ask.
This is your big chance to play with Masao and\nKazuo! So dive in, and, more importantly,\nhave fun out there!
Alright! The real training starts tomorrow!
Tak!
Junior Hero League: Day One
It's finally here, guys! The Junior Hero League!
I can't believe we're getting another chance\nto play in this stadium.
We've done what we can. Let's win this!
I'm impressed you've been keeping up with the\ntraining, <avatar_name>. You've got heart!
I am tired though...
Anything to play with others at the top!
Did you lose weight, Daimaru?
Well, yeah.
But just enduring is pretty amazing in my book.
Guess now we gotta live up to your expectations.
No way!
Now that you mention it...
It's about to start! Here we go, guys!
Let's do it!
The opening ceremony for the\nJunior Hero League sponsored by the\nSoccer Association will commence shortly.
Starting just this month, the best teams from\nNationals and even various regionals have\ngathered. But this is no mere exhibition.
The known goal of these games is that\nthey will determine the players for the\ninternational tournament in America next month!
While the top schools facing off is one thing,\nindividual play will also be important. The top\nplayers are competing to represent our nation!
Who from among these teams will be chosen to\nstand as heroes representing all of Japan?
And here come the players now!
We made it in time... somehow.
I'm impressed you were able to organize this\non such short notice.
You and me both.
It was only possible thanks to all the\nparticipating schools being so understanding.
I still can't believe the French International\nwas canceled and replaced with the\nJunior Youth World Challenge.
And there's also the inclusion of even more\nridiculously skilled teams from over the world...
The training camp... The European tour... All\nthose carefully laid plans just went up in smoke.
Indeed.
Every match is an opportunity\nfor a player to grow.
Exactly. That's why this\nJunior Hero League is so important.
Knowing that this isn't just an exhibition, but\nthat we're selecting players to represent Japan,\nshould inspire everyone to do their best.
Hopefully, the players can build on the potential\nthey showed at Nationals.
The Junior Hero League is a chance for us\nto see their growth in action.
Then, we will have succeeded in another objective,\nas well.
We will have aided them in developing the kind of\nskill it takes to compete on the world stage.
Indeed. We've done our part.\nNow, we just have to believe in them.
Alright guys, the Junior Hero League is starting!
All of our opponents are top teams with their own\nunique playstyles.
But never forget, we're a top team, too!\nNo one else can do what Hanawa does!
The soccer we made for ourselves won't lose\nto anyone!
Tak!
We thought the soccer season was over with\nNationals, but now that we've got another chance,\nlet's enjoy it for all it's worth!
Tak!
<avatar_name>, this'll be your first match\nas a regular. Nervous?
I'm shaking with excitement!
N-Nervous? Maybe... Yes!
I can't wait to play together!
So you're that type, huh? Good to hear.
It's your debut match, so show some hustle!
Well, at least you're honest.
But they say the guys who get nervous are the most\nearnest. Looking forward to seeing your potential\ncome to fruition on the field!
Ha ha, thanks.
But don't just focus on us, watch the whole team.\nWe've got high expectations for ya!
It's time, Masao! We gotta go!
On my way!
Listen up, <avatar_name>.
The best kids in the country are gonna be playing\nat this Junior Hero League.
Do well here, and those kids are gonna notice.
And when that happens, other players'll be lining\nup to meet ya. You can learn from 'em.
Find a good rival to compete with,\nand your skill level will skyrocket.
Time to get out there!
The Tachibana brothers, huh? Last time I saw you\ntwo was when we played each other in elementary\nschool.
Yeah. It was a draw, right?
Yeah... A draw.
Hmm?
No, never mind. This time we're pulling out all\nthe stops to beat you! I hope you're ready!
You stole the words right outta my mouth!\nJust wait until you see our plays!
Woohoo! We won!
That's one down!
Shoot, we lost!
The way you play together is as good as\nI remember...
Well, it sucks but it's hard to feel TOO bad after\nplaying your best.
But don't expect to keep beating us in\nhigh school!
Ha, we'll see about that! I can't wait!
(That match we tied... Hyuga intentionally tied\nit in order to make Nankatsu SC drop out in the\nprelims.)
(Which is why today was... Well...)
I'll admit it, you twins have some real\nfancy combo moves.
But me and Takei have our own tricks, and after\nall that training we did, we're not gonna lose\nto you!
It's on!
Wouldn't have it any other way!
You're about to witness the best duo in Japan!
See that? You can't beat the power of a brotherly\nbond!
Urgh... Their combos are even better than\nI imagined!
You weren't too bad yourselves.\nYou must've practiced a ton.
Thanks, but if we couldn't beat you two then\nobviously it wasn't enough.
I'm glad we got to face you guys first.\nYou can bet we'll be using what we learned from\nyou in the rest of our matches.
Anyway, good luck ahead!
Thanks!
You too!
...
What's gotten into you, Ishida? You look... happy.
Those Tachibanas really are something special.
Takei, let's polish up our combo moves and\ntake them on again when we hit high school!
Was my plan all along!
Alright! That's enough running!
Next we'll pair up in twos to practice passing.\nGet ready!
Got it!
We'll go first, Masao!
Roger!
I still can't get over how good those two are.
For sure. It's scary how good twins can\ncoordinate. No way anyone else could manage that.
Let me try, please!
You don't have to be twins to do that!
You seriously think you can keep up with Kazuo\nand Masao's passes? Aiming for the top, eh?
I mean, if you really wanna try.\nWe can partner up next!
Now, you've said it...
But he's right though? It's not like Nankatsu SC's\nGolden Duo were brothers or anything.
Okay <avatar_name>, you can pair up with me next!
Alright, here we go!
The aim and timing of your passes were\nall over the place.
I mean, we've tried training to match their\nrhythm, but we can't keep up at that speed.
So I get where you're coming from, <avatar_name>,\nbut give it up.
I like your attitude, <avatar_name>,\nbut you can't win with just attitude.
You've still got a long way to go before\nyou can keep up with me.
I'll do better next time!
Then, I'll try with Kazuo!
Are you even listening?
At least you're not a quitter.
Okay, try it with me this time!
If it didn't work with Masao,\nI doubt it's gonna work with me.
But at least you're not a quitter. Sure, why not?
Zróbmy to!
Here we go, <avatar_name>!
Wow, you just don't give up. Impressive.
Yeah. I can see how much you wanted to play\nwith Kazuo and Masao.
Okay, our last exercise will be a little\npractice game!
Okay!
Masao! Kazuo! You've got time, right? Join us!
Sure, got it!
Sorry guys, we'll have to pass.
Hey, wasn't that someone from the gymnastics club?\nDid they want something?
We'll explain later. Start without us!
And there they go...
Those two aren't the type to skip practice for\nno reason. Whatever it is, it's important.
Yeah. Anyway, we'd better not slack off either!
And that's it for today!
Good hustle out there, guys!
We've got this field reserved for another hour or\nso, so you can stick around if you want to keep\ngoing on your own.
Yo! Good work, guys.
You're back!
So what did you have to do at the gymnastics club?
Actually, we had them teach us how they train.
Like we said before, we've been looking into\ndifferent ways to improve the Skylab.
But we figured that if we bulked up too much\nthat'd get in the way, too.
So if normal muscle training was out, we thought\nit'd be good to learn how gymnasts and acrobats\ndo it.
We watched a lot of videos and tried stuff out,\nbut videos don't always give the best\nexplanations.
So we went to the gymnastics club for advice.
Their teacher helped out too,\nand we learned all sorts of useful tricks.
Like how if you train with weights, you put on\nextra muscle which slows you down, so you should\ntrain using body mass.
And we learned how to do these one-legged\nexercises to improve your balance.\nAnd how to stretch so you don't hurt yourself.
Acrobats, huh? Come to think of it, a lot of\nplayers do flips to show off after they score\na goal.
I... I've always thought that kinda stuff\nwas cool.
You?! Doing a flip?!
Hey, what's wrong with that?
Anyway, could you teach me? I wanna try it out!
I think you'd better work on scoring goals at all\nfirst.
C'mon guys, what's wrong with wanting\nto look cool? It keeps the hype up!
Well, since the training focuses on improving your\nmobility, it couldn't hurt. Why not have everyone\ngive it a try?
Oh, how about we do it today then?\nWe've still got time.
Why not? Let's get started right away!
Tak!
Oh hey, the Tachibanas. It's been a while.
Hey Urabe. Not since elementary school, huh?
I know you two are good, but between our tight\ndefense and my offense, there's no way you're\ngetting past us.
This game's in the bag!
Yeah right! You don't stand a chance!
Wait, I know you... You're that guy that got hurt\nin our elementary school match!
Gee, thanks for remembering.
I know it was just an accident, so I'm not holding\na grudge or anything, but that doesn't mean\nI'll turn down a chance for some payback.
Don't expect to get past me today!
You're on! Wait'll you see our new and improved\naerial soccer!
Woohoo! We won!
That's two!
Gah! I can't believe this!
What a combo play!\nNot even our Otomo Quartet could pin them down!
We lost. But... having a reason to really go\nas hard as we could was refreshing.
And your tight defense forced us to play at 120%.
Let's all stay healthy and look forward to our\nnext encounter!
Absolutely!
Hey, Matsuyama. This is the first time we've met\non the field like this.
We've been hearing your name since elementary\nschool. We always figured this day would come.
I could say the same to you,\nMasao and Kazuo Tachibana.
Your team's different from any other.\nTo be honest, I've been looking forward to this.
Which is better, Furano MS's teamwork or your duo?
Let's find out!
We'll show you how we play at Hanawa MS!
Aw, yeah! We won!
Heck yeah! That's two!
We lost to you two, fair and square.
No, we lost to Hanawa MS and your unique soccer.
Matsuyama...
Your combinations are incredible, and your team\nworks hard to enable you to use them on the field.\nWe're... actually pretty similar.
Congrats, Hanawa. As another team from the great\nsnowy north, we'll be cheering you on! Good luck!
Yeah, you too, Furano!
Okay, stop running! Let's move on to passing!
Alright!
Everyone's so enthusiastic today.\nEveryone's been pumped since morning.
Must be 'cause we've been winning our matches.\nThat's proof that the work is paying off.
Is that the cheer squad drumming?\nSeems like they're excited, too.
Oh yeah, I met their captain this morning.\nTalk about a ball of energy.
Oh yeah?
Yeah. The whole school was rooting for us to take\ndown Nankatsu at Nationals.
I remember that. They must've been cheering for us\ntwice as hard during our match against Nankatsu.
Naturally, they knew we'd want to win every game\nat the event, especially against Nankatsu,\nso they were like "you got it this time!"
I hear it's not just the cheer squad.\nThe band's getting pretty into it, too.
Wow, I never realized they cared so much about\nus... That's a lot of pressure, actually.
That'll just make it all the sweeter when we win.
Exactly. Soccer's way more fun when there's a\nproper audience!
So we can't let 'em down!\nAnd we need to show twice as much spirit!
Darn right!
Alright, you're up next, <avatar_name>! Idziemy!
Wait until you see how much better I am!
Thanks again, Masao!
Go ahead! Surprise me!
Sure thing! Bring it on!
Alright, here I go!
Huh... Looks like those two are hitting more\npasses today.
It's not like Masao's slowing down either.\n<avatar_name>'s just improved that much.
Already? That was fast!
We'd better step it up ourselves!
You bet! We're not going to let the rookie\noutshine us!
Hey guys! Are you gonna let <avatar_name> show us\nup? Let's shift this practice into high gear!
Alright!
(It's not like anyone was slacking off before,\nbut practice today is really intense.)
(I guess this is yet another perk of adding\n<avatar_name> to the team!)
Okay, break time! Get some water!
Masao! Kazuo! The pool will be free in five more\nminutes.
Got it, thanks!
Sorry about taking over the pool.\nI know it's a lot to ask.
No, no, it's fine! We're all expecting great\nthings from the soccer team!
If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask!\nWe'll help out however we can!
First gymnastics, and now the swimming\nclub?
A dip in the pool does sound nice.
Yeah, whatever it takes to improve the Skylab.
One of the training techniques\nwe found uses a pool.
We're not going in to just splash around.
This is all about making the Skylab as perfect\nas it can be.
The Skylab Hurricane needs a lot of strength,\nbut timing is also critical.
The real power of the move only comes out when\nthe person on the ground pushes at the exact same\ntime as the person on top jumps.
If we're even a little bit off, the jump loses a\nlot of oomph. If it's really bad, we won't even\nreach the ball.
So we need to practice syncing up our timing. But\ndoing it for too long on land strains our legs.
But if we do it in the water, where we're\nbasically weightless, we can keep it up all day.
So we asked the swimming club when it'd be a good time\nto get in the water without getting in their way.
Wow, you guys are really putting a lot of thought\ninto this.
Well, duh. This is our signature move.\nOf course, we're the ones who'll be focused\non making it better.
Coming up with this stuff is half the fun!
Besides, special training away from the field\nsounds like we're on a secret mission.
Sounds like you two are enjoying yourselves.
I mean, if you're gonna train, why not have fun\nwith it? It'll probably be more effective that\nway anyway!
Whoops, been yammering too much.\nDon't wanna waste that precious pool time.
Later guys!
Heh... Yeah, I can see how developing new training\nmethods would be fun.
Those two have also been thinking up new plays\nand making them work.
Don't we all do that?
Huh?
I mean, in order to support a play no one's ever\ndone before, we have to make one too, right?\nIsn't that what we're training for?
Like... what?
Take the Skylab Hurricane.\nWe need to pass especially high for them\nto take advantage of it, don't we?
Isn't that super-high pass something no one else\nhas ever trained for before?
You've got a point. No one would ever do a\nsuper-high cross like that in normal soccer.
We were in a hurry before Nationals and somehow\nmanaged to pull it off, but...
If we wanna win our matches here, we'd better get\nthat down to a science.
Sounds right to me. Good thinking, Aimoto.
Actually, when I looked back at our game\nwith Nankatsu, I felt pretty crappy.
Why?
Because at the end of the first half, we had a\nchance for a Skylab Hurricane, but my pass was\ntoo low so they couldn't pull it off.
If I'd made that pass perfectly, we could've tied\nit up, and the whole second half might've gone\ndifferently.
I can't get it out of my head...
Aimoto...
I know we'll never be able to play the way Masao\nand Kazuo do. But what we can do is help them out.\nThis time that's what I'm gonna do!
Well said, Aimoto!
Alright, then let's practice those passes!
Okay, where should I aim?
I don't know how high to aim.
Well, I think I've got a feel for it.
You don't? Well, I usually just go by feel,\nI guess.
And you're that accurate? That's crazy...
Oh, I just thought of something! One sec!
Um, okay.
Sorry for the wait!
That's, uh, a pretty long stick.
Someone just left it behind the school.
What's it for?
If we're going to practice accurate high-passes\nlike Aimoto said, we'll need a target, right?
We'll stick up this pole in from of the goal to\nmark where the Skylab Hurricane would go and\nwe can aim our passes at it.
Oh, I get it!
Definitely better than aiming at nothing!
Good thinking, Ono!
It just popped into my head after what\n<avatar_name> said.
Then let's get into our positions\nand practice making our passes!
<avatar_name>'s a forward, so let's practice\nmaking kicks straight up from the goal box!
<avatar_name>'s a midfielder, so let's pass from\nthe side together!
<avatar_name>'s a defender, so we'll practice\nmaking passes from the edge of the attacking\nthird and the middle third.
Then, I'll do it from centerfield... no a little\nfarther. I'll aim for in front of the goal!
Just remember Daimaru, a strong kick's no good\nwithout any control.
Yeah, I know! I can do this!
Okay guys, let's rock this!
We're not gonna be outdone by Masao and Kazuo!
Racja!
Hey, Tachibanas.\nBeen looking forward to facing you.
Aerial soccer is kinda my thing too,\nso be prepared to get shut down!
Hmph! We'll see about that!
The skies above the pitch are ours! I bet you\ncan't even get high enough to compete with us!
The Ace Killer knows no such limits!
Masao! Kazuo! We'll get the ball up to you\nwhere he can't reach!
Trust us and go for it!
Got it!
Of course, we trust you!
Alright! We did it!
That's three straight wins!
Guess you guys are too tough, even for me.
I've never had to face a combo as good\nas yours before.
It's not like we won on our own, Soda.
We couldn't have done it without our teammates.
So that's the secret? Duly noted.
Anyway, good luck, Hanawa!
Yeah, you, too!
(Man, those brothers are crazy.\nThere's no one else like 'em.)
(I may have lost, but I've never had so much fun.)
The Tachibana brothers...\nAlways wanted to face you guys someday.
Ever since a duo made me look like a klutz back\nat Nationals, I've been workin' on ways to fight\nback.
Get ready to get wrecked!
Like that's gonna happen! We're invincible!\nThe ultimate duo!
Guess that means when me and Jito beat you,\nwe're taking the title of ultimate duo!
Go ahead and try! I can't wait to see the look on\nyour faces when this is over!
Same, but for when you're eating those words!
Masao! Kazuo! We'll be sending you our best\npasses! That guy may be a brick wall,\nbut you can hop right over him!
That's the plan!
We're counting on you!
We pulled it off!
That's three straight wins!
Gah!
How do you like them apples?
Grr... you two are some duo,\nmakin' a fool outta me!
It's not like we won on our own, Jito.
It was the strength of our teammates that allowed\nus to come through like we did.
Shoulda tackled more of your buds. Good lesson.
Anyhow, don'cha dare lose to anyone else!
I hope the "ultimate duo" wins the rest of their\ngames!
Thanks! And good luck to you too, guys!
...
What's wrong, Jito?
Nah, it's nothin'.
(The Skylab Hurricane is insane.)
(Yet... I may not be a jumper, but I sure as heck\ngot the legs to launch someone.)
(If we end up on the rep team together, maybe\nI could try that technique out with them...)
Three wins! We're on a roll! Full steam ahead!
But our next opponents are Musashi, Toho,\nand Nankatsu. That's gonna be a slog.
We gotta keep the hype alive, and spend as much\ntime in our cleats and on the field as we can.
Tak! Let's stop flapping our gums and get back\nto it!
Heck yeah!
Okay! Let's charge in with a Combo Pass,\n<avatar_name>!
What the...?!
S-So fast!
You're up, Aimoto!
On it like a bonnet!
Great pass, Aimoto! Got some good altitude!
Thanks! This special training is paying off!
Wow <avatar_name>, you're really working those\npasses with Masao.
I can tell you're figuring out how to move with\nthe team.
You're not quite there yet,\nbut you're syncing up pretty well.
You're incredible... We'd never be able to manage\nthat, and in such a short time, too!
By the way, that Skylab Hurricane just now looked\na lot... lighter? Like you weren't straining as\nmuch as you used to.
Yeah. We've really lowered its impact on our legs,\nso we can use it more frequently.
Training is the path to victory!
Also, my posture midair is less wobbly now.\nGives me some breathing room.
Like, I can see everyone from up there,\nno matter where they are.
Whoa, that sounds pretty sweet.
Yeah, I get a chance to take in the field after\nlaunching Kazuo, myself, while he's in midair.
Everyone's eyes are glued to Kazuo.\nAnd not just the players... the whole stadium.
After a crazy leap like that, of course they are.
Actually, I can feel everyone's eyes on me, too.\nI kinda like it.
I didn't notice before, but it must've been\nlike that ever since we started using the\nTriangle Shot.
Kazuo, can you see what they're doing?
Is there an opening?
You mean the opponents? Yeah, I can see them. Duh.
But to be honest, everyone pretty much comes to\na standstill when I'm midair.
An opening? Well...
Wha?!
Wait a minute...
That's it!
Wh-Why are you guys suddenly shouting?
You're a genius, <avatar_name>!
When Kazuo's in the air,\neveryone's attention is on him!
Which means they're full of openings!
Oh!
Now that you mention it...
No one can peel their eyes off the\nSkylab Hurricane!
So... I can use my airtime to look for a gap\nin their defense.
...
Oh! But that's not our only trick, Masao!
I was just thinking the same thing!
Wait, what? Just tell us already, you two!
The Triangle Shot!
Tak! We can use that!
Huh? But didn't...?
Yeah, Ishizaki figured out how to stop it.
But we have a solution for its weakness.
Really? What is it?
The Skylab!
Exactly! With that, we don't even need the\ngoalpost! We can just do it wherever we want!
No, wait, back up. If you're both doing the\nSkylab, then who's taking the shot?
Obviously that's...
<avatar_name>!
M-Me?!
You can count on me!
Yeah, you.
I mean, who else is there?
You bet we can! Just what I wanted to hear!
If you can sync up with our passes,\nyou can also do this!
It's your time to shine, man!
Oh yeah, didn't you say earlier that you wanted\nto unleash a three-person combo?
Well, I guess dreams do come true!
If anyone can do it, it's you, <avatar_name>!
Anyway, I think you already got the gist of it,\nbut we should probably make it crystal clear.
In the Triangle Shot, one of us jumps up in the\nair while the other dashes into a clear spot.
Then the guy in midair passes it down and BAM,\nright into the goal.
But this time we're adding the Skylab.
While I'm jumping, everyone's gonna be looking\nat me.
Which'll give you time to find a space to make\na clear shot and get to it.
Then, I'll pass it down to you.
Since you'll be shooting from a blind spot,\nthey won't have much time to react,\nwhich makes it pretty likely to score.
But if you can't find an open spot for a direct\nshot quickly, then our opponents will catch on\nand shut it down. It'll be all on you, man.
Anyway, let's try it out ASAP!
Ready, <avatar_name>?
Here we go you three!
C'mon, just pass it already!
Bam!
Let's go, Masao! First, the Skylab!
On it!
Now, <avatar_name>! Here's the pass!
I... I have to make it!
And the shot!
Whoops. Swing and a miss.
Eh, it was our first try.
One more time!
Ha!
Jump, Kazuo!
Here it comes, <avatar_name>!
Again? Hmm...
Just from watching, this seems pretty tough\nto pull off.
I mean, making a shot from a pass out of Skylab\nHurricane is doubtlessly easier said than done.
A direct shot like that is already difficult on\nits own. And on top of that the incoming pass is\nfrom the weirdest angle ever.
Not to mention the powerful header from Kazuo,\nnow that he's beefed up. Matching the timing with\nthat sounds like a nightmare.
Also, I think Kazuo may need to be careful\nwhere he's looking.
If he looks toward the place he's gonna pass too\nsoon, the other team will pick up on it.
Good point. The best part of this move is that it\nkeeps 'em distracted with the Skylab Hurricane,\nright?
I can't let my eyes give away the plot. Got it.\nI'll keep it in mind.
Anyway, as long as my legs are still good\nwe can keep this up as long as we need to!
Shoot, why isn't it working?
One more time, Aimoto!
No, we'd better not. I don't want your legs\nto pop a vein.
Please, Aimoto!
Your captain has given you an order!
I mean, I get how much you wanna get this to work,\n<avatar_name>.
You heard him.
Fine, but this is the last one!
Give me all you've got, Masao!
Sure thing!
Here it comes, <avatar_name>!
Darn, no good.
Ugh...!
Ngh!
Masao! Kazuo!
Dang, that's my limit.
It's a lot better than before,\nbut we still have limits.
Let's call it for today.
We'll take care of the cleanup,\nso you two head back first and get some rest.
Sorry, thanks.
Hey, <avatar_name>, can ya help me walk back?\nLend me a shoulder.
Anyway, thanks guys.
I suppose this is another weakness of the Skylab.\nIt's a tricky move, and it puts a strain on 'em\nwhen used to excess, even in practice.
<avatar_name> was really struggling with those\nshots, too. Is this gonna work?
He's the guy Masao and Kazuo chose.\nWe just have to trust them.
Three Days Later...
Here it comes!
Let's do this, Masao!
Get it, <avatar_name>!
Gah! So close!
But you're getting better every time,\n<avatar_name>! Your timing and aim are coming\ntogether! We're almost there!
Oof!
Ouch!
Masao! Kazuo!
Don't worry, we're fine.
But...
We can keep going. We just need a little break.
Hmm, it's been four days,\nand you've tried it forty times, maybe?
I mean, you can't help it if you need to rest your\nlegs, but if you don't get enough attempts in,\nI'm not sure it'll be ready in time.
Plus, you had to stop right as <avatar_name>\nwas getting the feel for it.\nThat's gonna set you back.
What if you jumped off the goal bar?
Maybe drop it from the second floor?
Oh, I get it. If we climbed up on top of the goal\nwe could jump off and throw the ball down?\nThat might get us as high as a Skylab.
It's not the worst idea, but wouldn't that\nbe really dangerous?
What if the goal fell over?\nSomeone could get really injured.
Oh! Why didn't I think of that?
Sure, but you'll have to do it near the windows,\nand won't have much space to work with.
Not to mention how we'd probably end up breaking\na window.
Yeah...
What other ways can we drop the ball from high up?
Oh, I just had a great idea!
What is it?
The gymnasium! The gym has that walkway on the\nsecond floor to reach the windows, right?
That should be high enough, and since it's the\ngym there's plenty of space to run around!\nThere's even a big net to split the room!
That might just be perfect!
But doesn't the volleyball team use the gym?
Can't hurt to ask! If they let us, then great!
Wow, Murasawa acts quick.
More like he gets tunnel vision as soon\nas a thought enters his head.
Hey guys! They'll let us use the gym!
Seriously?
Tak! They said okay after I explained the sitch!
They'll let us borrow it for an hour at lunch,\nand another hour first thing in the afternoon.
Man, glad you asked 'em.
Wait, lunch? That's like right now!
Sure is! So let's gather up some balls\nand head over!
Wait, hold on, we have to wash the balls first!
Oh yeah. I doubt the volleyball team would\nappreciate us dirtying up their floors.
Alright! First years, wash the balls!\nSecond years, dry 'em!\nThird years, take 'em to the gym! Hut hut!
On it!
As for Masao and Kazuo...\nGet some rest while we keep working on this.
Ah, yeah, sure thing...
Okay <avatar_name>. Idziemy!
Catch ya later, Masao and Kazuo!
I'm going to have this shot down!
Y-Yeah, good luck!
W-We're counting on you!
And off they go...
Wow, everyone's so focused on this.
For real.
As for us...
There's only one thing to do, right Masao?
Yeah.
If we ever end up like this in a match, how much\ncan we still contribute? And how fast can we\nrecover while running around?
We'll never get a better chance to test that out.
If life give you muscle fatigue,\nmake lemonade, right?
The whole team... actually the whole school has\nbeen helping us out.\nWe gotta make it all worth something!
For sure!
They're late.
Yeah, it's already been three hours.
Hey guys, sorry we're late!
You two got some rest, right?
Yeah, we made good use of our time.
What about you?
See for yourself!
Show 'em the new arsenal, <avatar_name>!
Here it comes!
Kazuo! Jump!
Show me what you've got, <avatar_name>!
Whoa... that was awesome!
I-It was perfect!
I can't thank everyone enough!
I did my best for you two!
Everyone helped, but no denying you still did most\nof the work!
Whoa, settle down there, <avatar_name>!\nYou're practically glowing!
It wasn't just us though. The volleyball team set\nup a relay system to pass balls back up to the\nsecond floor.
Which let <avatar_name> pound out shots constantly\nfor three hours.
Three hours non-stop?! Unbelievable...
And halfway through, the volleyball coach started\nspiking the ball so it'd be coming down faster.
Seriously, we owe this school so many favors\nby now.
That's just... We've gotta go thank them.
Still, the pressure's mounting, guys.
They're expecting us to win this after they've\nhelped out so much. We gotta win for them!
Ha ha... Sounds good to me!
Tak! With this up our sleeve, we can take on\neven Tsubasa, Hyuga, and Misugi!
But we can't slack off!\nWe're just getting started!
You said it!
Well, uh, after lunch anyway. I'm starving!
You can say that again.
Huh? So you two haven't eaten yet either?
Nope.
Figures.\nI'm guessing you didn't get any rest either.
Well... You can see right through us, huh?
Duh. How long do you think we've known you?
Whatever, we can all eat together\nand start practice a little late!
Okay!
Alright, let's call it for today!
But we're starting early tomorrow! Get some rest!
We will!
Alright, dismissed!
<avatar_name> is amazing, isn't he?\nWho could've foreseen he'd come so far?
To be honest, it's kinda frustrating that\nhe managed to do what we couldn't.
You know, I've been thinking...
What's so cool about Masao and Kazuo's playstyle\nisn't just the big flashy moves,\nbut all the thought that goes into it.
Yeah, I agree, Ono.\nMaybe <avatar_name> thinks the same way.
I just hope that we can keep up with him.
I know what you mean. It's not like we can support\nMasao and Kazuo the way he does.
But that doesn't mean we can't help out\nin our own way.
We can help all three of them out.\nWe just need to keep on thinking!
Absolutely!
We don't have many matches left, but we can each\nlook into stuff on our own and keep making Hanawa\nbetter.
We certainly can!
The famous Tachibana brothers of Hanawa MS... I've\nalways wanted a chance to face your unique style.
The feeling's mutual.
I mean, you're Jun Misugi, the prodigy who even\nTsubasa and Hyuga fear. Let's make this a good\none!
I've thoroughly analyzed all your matches\nfrom both Nationals and your league games.
We know all your tricks, and how to stop them.\nToday's the day the Musashi sword cuts you down!
That's what you think!
Then all we need to do is show you a way\nto play you've never seen before!
Victory!
That makes four!
Congratulations. You beat us fair and square.
I never imagined you'd reveal a brand new move\nhere.
It seems I'm still learning the depths of this\ngame... I underestimated what your imaginations\nwere capable of.
The strength of your combination moves exceeded\nmy imagination.
It felt just like when I faced Tsubasa and Misaki\nback in elementary school.
Thanks, Misugi.
That means a lot, coming from you.
I said this before the match,\nbut your style really is unique.
If you two are picked as reps, I'm sure you'll\nbe of great value as Japan takes on the world.
Eh, we can worry about that once this is over.
See ya, Misugi! Take care of yourself!
I will! You two need to rest up!
Okay, that's enough practice for today!
Good work, everyone!
Phew...
*pant*
You two seem exhausted.
Pull yourselves together!
What gave it away?
You're one to talk, <avatar_name>.
You two can head home. We'll clean up here.
Yeah, you seriously need some rest.
Sorry again, guys.
We'll leave the rest to you.
The fatigue really builds up when we have one\ntough match after another. It makes it hard for\nMasao and Kazuo to recover and be effective.
Then, we need to figure out how we can carry\nsome more of the load for them.
All that're left are Toho and Nankatsu. But at\nthis rate it'll end up just like Nationals.
That's why we're busy coming up with a brand new\nstyle for Hanawa, right?
Exactly!
Something new?
Spill the beans!
Oh, it's something we were talking about among\nourselves earlier.
We mean like how you worked hard to keep up\nwith Masao and Kazuo.
So we also need to step it up so we can better\nsupport them.
We mean like how you worked hard to keep up\nwith Masao and Kazuo.
We were talking about how we need to step it up,\nso we can better support them, too.
I'm pretty confident in the power of my kicks.\nThat's what I can offer!
On defense, we're gonna cover our marks so close\nthey can't breathe. Masao and Kazuo never need to\nworry about defense.
I can take advantage of the attention put on Kazuo\nand Masao to get away with some tricks on offense.
I'm gonna head deep into enemy territory\nand try to score in the confusion.
That way, our aces won't have to pay as much\nattention to offense OR defense, and they can do\ntheir thing.
We don't want to rely on those two for everything.\nWe're aiming for a playstyle where they're just\none part of the bigger whole.
We can go harder when we trust our teammates to\nhave our back. And that's good for morale all\naround. That's the new Hanawa!
Let me be a part of this!
I'll make good use of your support!
You already are!
We're counting on you, <avatar_name>!
Never doubted it for a second!
We're counting on you, <avatar_name>!
Both Nankatsu and Toho have improved a lot since\nNationals, so we need to keep up the pace too!
I mean, that's obvious, but I wish we had some\nhigh level practice partners to work with.
Sure, but we're the champions of Akita prefecture.\nWhere are we gonna find someone else on our level?
Oh, I know just the guys!
Seriously?
So how're you feeling, Masao?
Better than yesterday. Still not great.
We need to be in tip-top shape by\nthe next match...
Wait, isn't that...?
Long time no see, Masao and Kazuo!
Y-You guys?! Didn't you already graduate?!
What are you doing here?
We asked the old Hanawa alumni to come practice\nwith us.
If we want to take on Nankatsu and Toho,\nwe need to practice against the smartest\nopponents we can find.
We're here to whip you all into shape!\nNo lollygagging!
Racja!
Thank you guys for coming back and helping us out!
Thank you!
We've given you all the advice we have, so the\nrest is up to you. I can't wait to see you guys\nbeat Nankatsu and Toho!
Racja! We won't let you down!
See ya later!
Man, high schoolers are huge.\nIt's like playing against monsters.
But we learned a lot about how to shake off\na close mark and deal with rough tackles.
Showing us how to slip through a quick and strong\ndefense is definitely gonna come in handy, too.
And even though they were older than us, Masao,\nKazuo, and <avatar_name>'s combo still worked!
Y-Yeah.
Alright! Let's keep practicing what they taught\nus!
For sure!
Hey, what'd you think, Kazuo?
It was like playing with a whole new team today.
Everyone was way more proactive on both offense\nand defense. And even bounding around the field,\nthey were still light on their feet.
You know anything about this, <avatar_name>?
Actually...
We're starting something new for Hanawa.
Actually, what?
Oh?
So that's what they've been up to.
They wanted to mesh together with us better, huh?
They're doing so much for us.
Hey, Kazuo.
Yeah, I know, Masao.\nWe'll just have to play even better to repay them!
Hey, Hyuga. Haven't played against you\nsince elementary school.
Back then we tied, but today, we're winning!
I coulda won that match with one leg behind\nmy back.
I only let us tie to make Nankatsu drop out\nof the prelims.
Wh-What?!
But that was then. This is now.\nAnd the gap between us is even bigger!\nYou don't stand a chance!
I'll admit, I don't have a perfect defense against\nthe Tachibana brothers' aerial soccer.
But that doesn't mean I'm letting anything\nthrough! When they run up together it's obvious\nwhat they'll do!
Dang. They really don't think much of us.
But now it's clear they aren't giving much\ncredence to the rest of us.
This is what the new Hanawa is all about.\nTime to show 'em what we're made of!
Masao, Kazuo, we'll be running hard so that you\ncan do what you need to. Make good use of it!
Yeah, for sure! Thanks guys!
Tak!
We did it! We beat the champs!
We beat Toho Academy!
Are you freakin' kidding me?!
You like that, Hyuga?! We win!
I don't care how, but that makes our record one\nwin, one tie!
Grah!
I'm not exactly happy about it, but this was your\nwin, Hanawa. Congrats.
Not only were your combinations better than we\nexpected, but I couldn't direct my team fast\nenough to cope with all the on-field movement.
To be honest, you were pretty hard for us\nto keep up with, too.
But that just shows how hard we worked\nto beat you.
It's not over yet, Tachibanas!\nI'll see you in high school!
Can't wait!
Hope you'll be ready to lose again!
The night before the last day\nof the Junior Hero League.
I can't sleep...
I'm wide awake...
One... Two... Three... Four...
Five... Six... Seven... Eight...
Okay! Done with stretches!
Hey, <avatar_name>. Whatcha doing out so late?
I couldn't sleep.
What about you two?
Nervous? So even you get antsy sometimes.
Stretching every night before bed is part of our\nspecial Skylab training.
It's the night before our last match,\nso we're preparing as much as possible.
All that's left for us is to get a good night's\nsleep, get our morning massage,\nand then it's time for the final showdown.
You're so thorough!
Do you really need to do all that?
Of course.
We've got good reason to be.
Guess there's no use hiding it.
To be blunt, after all these games our legs\nare in bad shape.
But even so, holding back isn't an option.
Why? 'Cause we wanna end this with no regrets,\nwe can't let everyone down, and most of all,\nthis is our last game with the team.
So tomorrow we're gonna have a blast with everyone\nand leave it all on the field.\nThat's what we want.
Back before all this started, everyone told us\nthat it's been fun playing with us.
We were happy to hear that, but we're the ones\nwho should really be thanking them.
Without them, we never would've been able to play\nthe way we wanted to.
The way we play, our soccer,\nisn't made up of just the two of us.
No matter what crazy ideas we came up with,\nthey never would've worked without everyone else\nsupporting us.
Even the Skylab Hurricane...\nEven the Skylab Triangle we do with you.
Our teammates believe in us. They steal the ball\nfor us, dribble it up the field for us,\nand pass it to us.
Sure, acrobatic soccer isn't easy,\nand sometimes it hurts just to play.
But when your teammates are supporting you like\nthat, how could we let them down?
Those feelings are what make our soccer\nwhat it is.
Anyway, we should head back.
Yeah.
<avatar_name>!\nLiterally the most important part of pulling off\na combination move is food and sleep!
Sleep well, eat well, and have fun\nout there tomorrow!
It's finally here!
The match we've all been waiting for!\nOur final showdown with Nankatsu with our perfect\nrecord on the line!
And our last match together as a team.
Let's do this, Masao, Kazuo! Together!
Tak! We're counting on you guys!
We've done everything we could to prepare for this\nmatch. All that's left is to get out there and do\nwhat we do!
And when we win in the end,\nwe soak in the moment fully together.
Tak!
Now, let's head down to the field.
I-Is that... our cheer squad?!
There's so many of them!
Isn't this like double what it was at Nationals?!
Hey, soccer club guys!\nWe're here to cheer for you!
This time you'll beat Nankatsu for sure!
You've trained so hard for this,\nso you've gotta win!
Everyone...
Hey, look over there Kazuo!
That's... It's the guys from the\nHanawa Youth Soccer Club!
There are so many people here for us...
That's a lot of pressure...
We HAVE to win now, guys!
It's too late to complain now, <avatar_name>!
Especially, not in front of a crowd that size!\nYou just gotta roll with it and have fun!
You said it, <avatar_name>!
Not saying there's no pressure,\nbut that's part of the fun, too!
Okay people, we've got a lot of people hoping for\nus to win, so let's give 'em what they want!
Alright!
The day at last! What a beautiful summer sky!
Two teams will take the field, but only one will\nbe crowned champion of the Junior Hero League!\nWill it be Nankatsu or Hanawa?
Nankatsu's captain, Tsubasa Ozora, seems to\nhave recovered from his injuries at Nationals.
And on the other side is Hanawa MS, back for\na grudge match after their narrow defeat at\nNationals.
Their aces are Masao and Kazuo Tachibana, who've\npolished up their acrobatic soccer techniques just\nfor today!
And what's more, Hanawa is joined by a wild card\nfirst-year player, who has played a key role in\nthe team's success in this league!
Not only that, they brought a huge crowd of\nsupporters from their hometown in Akita\nPrefecture! Just listen to those cheers!
This will decide the ultimate, the best\nof the best, among the middle school teams!
Although this is an exhibition match,\neach is the champion of their league.\nThis is the de facto ultimate championship!
The match starts on the whistle!
Hey, is your shoulder okay, Tsubasa?
It's as good as new.
Good. Then we don't have to hold back!
We've been working hard on our aerial soccer\njust for you!
I have a feeling you'll like what you see!
Masao! Kazuo! I stopped your combinations\nbefore and I'll stop you again!
In your dreams!
We owe you big time for making our Triangle Shot\nand Twin Shot look lame. We've come with receipts!
Taking home the championship of the\nJunior Hero League with a perfect win streak,\nit's Akita's own Hanawa Middle School!
We... lost?
We... really lost.
We won...
We won?! For real?!
For real!
We finally beat Nankatsu and Tsubasa!
We WON!
Masao! Kazuo! We did it!
Oof, am I beat...
That was so fun!
This is what we've been working for all along!
This... This is the happiest day of my life!
You'd feel worse if you weren't!\nFeels great, doesn't it?
I've never felt so satisfied in my life.
Yeah, that emotion comes out in your play!
Playing is fun and having a serious match is fun,\nand those things together are soccer at its\nfinest!
Congrats, guys. You won the league.
Tsubasa...
Look, when we dominated all three years at\nNationals, I figured I was done with Japan.\nI was going to move to Brazil and turn pro...
At least, that's what I thought.
...
I was mistaken. I still have a lot to learn here.
What I felt from you guys on the field today\nwas the pure joy of playing your heart out.
Not to mention your imaginative attacks.\nI feel like... you've touched the root of what\nmakes soccer so great. I really enjoyed it.
Whoa... that's deep.
A herd of players chasing one ball. Scoring goals,\nstopping goals... There's a whole lot of room to\ncome up with tricks.
Isn't that what soccer's all about?
Yeah. That's why I love it.
Thanks, you two.\nYou reminded me of something important.
I never want to lose to anyone in the game\nI love so much. Or to enjoy it any less.
Which is why I need to maintain my dedication\nwithout becoming conceited.
Congrats, Hanawa. That was a knockout performance.
Tsubasa...!
Hear that? Your cheer squad's calling for you.\nGo thank them!
Racja!
Congrats, guys!
That was the best match ever!
Thanks for coming, everyone!
You wouldn't believe how much it helped!
We only won because of all your cheering!
Hey, Masao! Kazuo! Get over here!
Thank you so much, you guys!
Not just for the cheering either, for all the\nsupport you've given us this whole time!
We beat Nankatsu! We're undefeated in this league!\nThis is a victory for ALL of us!
We're so proud of you guys!
Thanks to all teams who participated\nin this exhibition tournament!\nThe Junior Hero League is now over.
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up\nfor the MVP of this tournament: the newcomer\nfrom Hanawa, <avatar_name>!
He shot through this league like a comet!\nHe is truly the "Junior Hero!"
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up\nfor the MVP of this tournament: the newcomer\nfrom Hanawa, <avatar_name>!
Not only that, he's also the top scorer of the\ntournament. It's a miraculous double crown, folks!
He shot through this league like a comet!\nHe is truly the "Junior Hero!"
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVPs of this tournament: the very symbols of\nHanawa, Masao and Kazuo Tachibana! What a pair!
And the top-scoring player of the tournament\nis the newcomer from Hanawa, <avatar_name>!
He earned recognition for sweeping past strikers,\nwhich is all the more impressive!
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVPs of this tournament: Masao and Kazuo\nTachibana of Hanawa MS! What a pair!
Since the Junior Hero League was won by their\nincredible combo techniques, it was agreed that\nthey would receive this honor together!
We would like to recognize twenty-one\nincredible players from the Junior Hero League!
From Hanawa MS: Masao Tachibana, Kazuo Tachibana,\nand <avatar_name>!
These twenty-one players will travel to\nthe United States to represent Japan\nin international competition.
Watch out! This new generation of players\nwill show the world what Japan can do!
So it's really over...
Tak! And boy did we end it on a high.
I feel so strange.\nLike, I'm happy, but also a little sad.
C'mon now, what's with this atmosphere? We won!\nThis was the best possible outcome.
Ha! You've got a point!
Time sure has flown since we first heard about the\nJunior Hero League, but looking back, every moment\nhas been amazing!
Coming up with new ideas for training,\nworking together with everyone at school...\nI can't imagine anything better.
We'll always treasure our memories of playing\nsoccer with you two, Masao and Kazuo.\nThank you so much!
What're you talking about?\nWe should be the ones thanking you.
Without you, we never could've come up\nwith our own style. Thanks, you guys.
Yeah, thank you so much.
Masao... Kazuo...
And let's not forget you, <avatar_name>.
Yeah, you seem a lot like them now.
Like us?
How do I put this...? It's not just the playstyle,\nit's the way you look at the game.\nThat's what's similar.
Yeah, it's the way they let their imaginations run\nwild, try out all these new ideas, and then bring\nit all together.
<avatar_name>'s the same way. You tried out a bunch\nof things, and came up with your own style.
We sure can't play like them.\nBut seeing <avatar_name> play helped us realize\nwhat makes the way they play so special.
So in a way, it's thanks to you that we could\nfinally all be on the same wavelength.\nYou taught us how to enjoy the process!
Thank you, <avatar_name>.
I wouldn't mind a little more praise!
I was always watching Masao and Kazuo!
Hey now, don't get cocky!
Yeah, that must be where you got it from.
Seriously, I'm so glad we met you!
Well, there you have it, <avatar_name>.\nApparently you've got the same thing we do.
I guess that's how you could sync up with us\nso well.
And you proved that you don't have to be brothers\nto pull off an awesome combo move.
Well... Maybe not the Skylab Hurricane.
Either way, just keep on spreading your love of\nsoccer to everyone else, and keep on lifting each\nother up to keep Hanawa fresh and exciting!
You can count on me!
You think I can?
Never a doubt! That's why I said it!
Have some confidence!\nIf anyone can do it, it's you!
I still can't believe <avatar_name> made it\nthis far, and I'm the one who recommended him!
Best play you've ever made, Daimaru!
<avatar_name>, your hard work has given us both\na new combination shot and a new Hanawa.
I kinda doubt you'll be pulling off any Skylab\nTriangles without us, but the second part you\ncan definitely keep doing!
Yeah, make sure you lead the team to victory\nat next year's Nationals!
You can ask us for guidance whenever, too!
Can't wait to see what Captain <avatar_name>\npulls off!
You can do it! Good luck!
Oh right, I almost forgot!\nCongrats on getting picked as reps you three!
Oh yeah, thanks!
Well, two of you at least were a given.
You wouldn't find that kinda acrobatic soccer\nanywhere else, even if you looked all over the\nworld.
You know it! I bet the reps'll be glad\nto have 'em!
But wow, <avatar_name>, you got picked too.
You weren't even a Hanawa regular until recently.\nThat's one heck of a promotion.
Yeah, your star is rising fast!
Yeah, remember that it's not just us,\nyou were picked, too.
Which means someone out there is looking forward\nto what we three can come up with together.
Go out there and show the world what makes\nus special!
Yeah, just watch us!
If they let me play anyway...
I know I'LL make regular, but...
Don't worry, we will!
Make sure you win in style while you're at it!
Uh, yeah, I guess you have to worry about that,\nhuh?
Don't worry, I know you can do it! You just have\nto let them see how hard you work in practice!
Oh, it's on now!
We're up against some stiff competition,\nbut we'll make it, you'll see!
Anyway, good luck you three!\nRemember that you're representing us out there!
Yeah, we know! We won't let you down!
We'll be cheering for you from Japan!
Along with everyone else from school!
And you might as well come back with that\nchampionship title while you're at it!
It's a promise! Just you wait!
Okay, that's enough!\nTime to move on to one-on-one practice with\nthird years against the first and second years!
Awesome!
Don't be shy because we're the senior squad,\nkeep on fighting!
I can't believe they're all so energetic in this\nheat.
I'd expect that from the third years, but even\nthe younger kids are keeping up with Jito's strict\ntraining.
Eh, this is nothing.
Training hard is how we get better.
Yeah.
Oh, Sano's next?
You won't stop me like that!
Sano sure is something else.\nI wouldn't be surprised if the team wins\nNationals with his help.
...
What's the matter, Hatakeyama?
It's just... that first year over there.
Hmm?
Well, seems like he's got room for improvement.
But what caught your eye?
He's been getting his butt handed to him\nevery time, but he's cool as a cucumber.\nIf anything, he's even more fired up.
Normally, I'd expect him to be discouraged,\nbut he's like a rhino charging back in!
Yeah, it's like he's a lion charging after prey.\nGood attitude.
And we're done! Time for a practice match!
Racja!
Heh heh! Training is one thing, but a match is\nwhere it's at. C'mon guys, let's do this!
Tak!
Is that all?
Nice moves, <avatar_name>.
You really went after the seniors. I bet you\nshine when it counts, rather than in drills.
Wait. Is that the coach?
Seems like he's in a hurry. Did something happen?
...
...
...
Alright, and that's time!\nNow, let's compare answers from the mock test.
Ho-Hold on a sec!
Just one more question! C'mon, Himeji!
Nope. You have to answer within the time limit.
It's not like in soccer,\nyou don't get stoppage time.
Mmm...
Fine...
I can't believe we're studying for a test in this\nsweltering locker room. What did I do to deserve\nthis?
Where else could we go? The study room is full,\nand the other clubs are using the library.
Gah, studying is such a pain! Why can't we just\nhead to the field and kick the ball around?
I'd love to too, but Nationals are over. And we'll\nbe in trouble if we don't study for this test.
I mean, sure, but...
Didn't we decide we were all going to Kunimi\nInstitute for its prestigious soccer program?\nThey won't take you if you're obviously dumb.
Grr...
Still though, feels like it was only yesterday\nthat we faced Nankatsu at Nationals.
That's true. We trained all last year just\nfor that one match...
That one match...
Yeah...
What the--?
B-Big news!
"Junior Hero League?"
Y-Yeah.
The coach came down to the field to tell us.
He was on the phone with the Soccer Association.\nApparently, there's a qualifier to decide who\ngets to represent Japan in America next month.
He got a call from the Soccer Association,\nand they said Hirado MS is going!
So basically just exhibition matches?
Ya think they'll let us third years play, too?
Absolutely. I heard anyone could play,\nregardless of year.
Well isn't that something!
We don't got time to be studyin'!\nWe gotta play in that league!
Heh. I'm gettin' fired up!
(Pst, Himeji. You think the captain's just trying\nto get out of studying?)
(Well, ALSO that.)
Huh? You two say somethin'?
Nope, nothing.
By the way, Morisue. Have you heard which schools\nother than Hirado will be there?
Figured you'd ask, so I made sure to bring a copy\nof the bracket!
Man, you think ahead. Let's see here...
Oh... so there are 14 teams total,\ndivided into groups of 7 teams each.
So who's in our bracket?
There's Nankatsu... Toho Academy... Otomo...
Nankatsu and Toho?!
They probably matched up teams with similar skill\nlevels to help choose the best players.
That means they must've rated us highly for\nour match with Nankatsu!
Hey Captain, this is our chance to go head to head\nwith Nankatsu again!
Hoo boy!
And it ain't just Nankatsu with Tsubasa either.\nThey're throwin' in Toho with Hyuga, too.
That's a fight to be sure! S'like they're doin'\nthis just for me! Awesome!
This is just a thought, but...
If we win a tournament that has the two national\nchampions in it...
...Isn't that just as good as winning Nationals?
Ooh, good point!
Alright guys! We're gonna enter this tournament,\nand we're gonna win it!
Tak!
Hey, so do we have a schedule?
Yup. Now, where did I put it...
Oh, here it is.
Let's see... Looks like our match with Toho is\nour fifth, and Nankatsu's on the final day.
Now that I get a good look at it, seems like\nNankatsu and Toho are the only big shots in the\nline-up.
Best to save our strength early on then.\nBuncha wimps ain't worth the trouble.\nGotta save our strength for the big fish.
...
Hey, Jito.
Yeah?
Since tournaments like this don't happen every\nday, how about we give it our all every match?
Every match?
I'm with Himeji on this.
Back when we were prepping to play Nankatsu,\nwe hid our skill and purposely got close wins\nso no one would notice us.
But after our match with Nankatsu, everyone\nalready knows what Hirado is capable of.
Which means our opponents are gonna face us\nseriously, too.
Yeah. And if they're throwing everything at us\nincluding the kitchen sink, we've gotta step up,\ntoo.
Even if we're the better team, they could pull the\nrug out from under our feet if we're not careful.
Studying's paid off. You make a good argument.
...
This Junior Hero League is almost definitely gonna\nbe our last soccer tournament in middle school.
So rather than focusing all our efforts on keeping\nunder the radar, I wanna show the country the\nskill we spent the last year honing.
Hmm...
...You guys got a point. If everyone knows\nwhat we're up ta, no reason to be scheming.\nLet's just blast 'em!
Crushing our opponents like bugs does sound\nlike a boatload of fun!
Alright, we're doin' this!
Our goal this time's not just to win all our\nmatches, it's to DOMINATE them!
Tak!
Heck yeah! Time to let loose with both barrels!
Beating all the top teams... I'm itching to go!
Really? Maybe you should see a doctor about that.
It's a figure of speech...
(Goin' all-out, huh?)
(And more than that...)
...
Hey, Jito?
What?
If we're aiming to "dominate" this time, how about\nwe try switching in new members to improve the\nteam even more?
Like, say, throw in some more offense to boost our\nfront line to keep up the pressure. That's how we\nreally wreck the other team's defense!
In that case, we've gotta boost our midfield,\nright? As they say, whoever controls the midfield\nwins the war.
Oh, if we're doing that, then nothing instills\ndespair like making our defense even more\nimpenetrable, yeah?
I getcha. I was just thinkin' the same thing.
Besides, if ya stop and think about it, how're\nwe supposed to beat Nankatsu or Toho if we're no\nbetter than before?
Yeah, and the Nankatsu we saw playing in the\nfinals seemed even better than they were when\nthey faced us.
Which means Toho must've been just as good as\nthem for the match to be that close.
Plus, wasn't Tsubasa injured during Nationals?\nHe should be healed up this time around.
Not to mention that ridiculous shot power Hyuga\nhas. I can't imagine it'll be easy to shut him\ndown.
Guys, we all know those two are good. But they've\ngotta have back-up who are good enough not to slow\n'em down, too.
So, uh, anyway, what kind of player should we add?
...
Sano. You know the first and second years better'n\nI do. Any of 'em seem promising?
The first and second years? Let me think...
Oh! There's one!
A first year named <avatar_name>.
He's always taking on players better than him, in\nboth training and matches. He's pretty decent in a\nreal match, too.
So I'd say he's got promise, yeah.
<avatar_name>, huh? Sounds good.
We had someone like that the whole time?
Then, I guess I'll give him a little test!
Hey, <avatar_name>, come here for a second!
Sorry for keeping you after practice.
Sorry 'bout the short notice,\nbut we're going mano-a-mano, now.
We're fighting? I won't lose!
If you mean soccer, I won't lose!
You think you can take me, Jito?
Wha--?!
Ya think you can take ME in a fight?\nYa know who I am?!
Plus, from what I'm seein' you're way too scrawny\nfor a brawl. No way, no how.
...But forget that. That's not why I'm here.
Duh! This is soccer!
Good answer!
Cocky, ain't ya?
But is your bite as good as your bark?\nTry sayin' that again when I'm through with ya!
You ready?
Hey, what's the matter!\nI beat ya ten times in a row!
That's Jito for you.\nNo mercy, even for a first year.
But look.\n<avatar_name>'s still got fight in his eyes.
He's not giving up even after all that? Wow.
Jito! The school's gonna close soon!
Hmph. Fine.
This is the last one, <avatar_name>.
Show me you've got the guts to take me on!
(Impressive! That drive to win...)
Łoł! Awesome!
<avatar_name> beat the captain!
...
Heh. I get it now.
(Sano must've seen how much courage and drive\nthis kid's got. He won't back down from nothin'.)
I've seen what you can do, <avatar_name>.
Thing is, there's a tournament comin' up,\nand Hirado's gonna be there.
Obviously, we've got an eye on winning it all,\nbut that'll be easier said than done with Nankatsu\nand Toho there, too.
We were lookin' to get some new blood on the team,\nso I was testing you out.
And now that I've seen ya up close,\nI gotta say you're just the guy for the job.
<avatar_name>! I'm movin' ya to regular,\nstarting tomorrow!
And then you'll get some REAL training to whip ya\ninto shape for the tournament.\nHope you're ready!
Bring it on!
P-Please go easy on me...
Hope you can keep up with my intensity!
I'll earn my spot on the team!
Just what I like to hear!
Hey now, what happened to that fire from before?
Don't worry, <avatar_name>.\nJust believe in yourself and stay strong!
Nothing scares you, huh?
He's gotta be at least that cheeky,\nor he's not worth my time!
We're gonna give ya the works,\nso look forward to it!
That's the spirit!
Anyhow, tomorrow we'll start the extra training\nfor the Junior Hero League!
Don't die on me now, ya hear!
Tak!
Junior Hero League: Day One
Man, never thought we'd be back in this stadium\nin the same summer.
You never know what's gonna happen in life.
Seriously though, all those days of training\nwere the roughest I can remember.
Jito's special training was almost nostalgic at\nthis point, but thanks to that I'm back in shape.
Hey, <avatar_name>, the captain really pushed you\nhard. You feeling okay?
My whole body is a bruise...
Jito can't slow me down!
I'm fine, but what about you all?
Well, of course.
But still, you managed to keep up with him.\nI'm impressed.
Well said!
I'm sure that's why he's taken such a shine to\nyou, <avatar_name>.
Huh, you're relaxed enough to worry about us?\nI guess you really are alright then.
Just keep it up!
The opening ceremony's about to start! Idziemy!
Alright!
The opening ceremony for the\nJunior Hero League sponsored by the\nSoccer Association will commence shortly.
Starting this month, the best teams from\nNationals and various regionals have gathered.\nBut this is no mere exhibition.
The known goal of these games is that\nthey will determine the players for the\nInternational Tournament in America next month!
While the top schools facing off is one thing,\nindividual play will also be important. The top\nplayers are competing to represent our nation!
Who from among these teams will be chosen to\nstand as heroes representing all of Japan?
And here come the players now!
We made it in time... somehow.
I'm impressed you were able to organize this\non such short notice.
You and me both.
It was only possible thanks to all the\nparticipating schools being so understanding.
I still can't believe the French International\nwas canceled and replaced with the\nJunior Youth World Challenge.
And there's also the inclusion of even more\nridiculously skilled teams from over the world...
The training camp... The European tour... All\nthose carefully laid plans just went up in smoke.
Yes, they did.
Every match is an opportunity\nfor a player to grow.
Exactly. That's why this\nJunior Hero League is so important.
Knowing that this isn't just an exhibition, but\nthat we're selecting players to represent Japan,\nshould inspire everyone to do their best.
Hopefully, the players can build on the potential\nthey showed at Nationals.
The Junior Hero League is a chance for us\nto see their growth in action.
Then we will have succeeded in another objective,\nas well.
We will have aided them in developing the kind of\nskill it takes to compete on the world stage.
Indeed. We've done our part.\nNow, we just have to believe in them.
Alright, the Junior Hero League is startin'.
Our goal here is to be godlike in all our matches.\nWho cares if they're Nankatsu or Toho?\nWe just gotta crush 'em like we trained for!
Heck, who cares about the score difference either?\nJust go wild out there and show 'em what Hirado\nis made of!
Tak!
This'll be your first match as a regular,\nhuh <avatar_name>? Nervous?
Just let me loose already!
N-Nervous? Of course not...
Turn that emotion into power!
Guess I didn't need to worry.
Okay! Go out there and get in their faces!
...Not the best liar, are ya?
But no need to be scared, we'll be out there, too.
Just believe in us and do what you do best!
So you already get how it works. Good to hear.
Everyone gets nerves before a match, but the\nwinners are the ones who can put them to good use.
I've got high hopes for ya, <avatar_name>!
Okay, it's about time to go!
Got it!
Listen, <avatar_name>.
The Junior Hero League has all the best players\nin the country. This is a pro style tourney.
Do well here, and a lot of guys'll take notice\nof ya.
You'll get to know a lot of folks,\nand learn what makes 'em tick, too.
And if you find a good rival,\nyou'll get to improve even faster.
So don't hold back out there!
We've done our research on you, Hirado.
I'll admit it's impressive how you pushed Nankatsu\nto the brink like that, but that won't work on us!
Heh.
Wh-What's so funny?!
We did our research, too.\nBut it was a waste of time, 'cause all we learned\nis that you guys don't stand a chance.
Wh-Why you--!
I hope you're ready for what we're like when\nwe're serious!
Took the words right out of my mouth!
Throwing the enemy off their game with a taunt\nisn't a bad strategy.
Eh, there's that too, but I just figured it'd be\nfunnier if they went all out right off the bat.
Oh. I see.
In that case, we'd better hit the ground running,\ntoo!
Aw, yeah! We won!
One win for us!
Dang, since when was Hirado so good?!
Same to you. You Meiwa Higashi guys were better'n\nI thought.
...It's our loss.
But we won't lose next time.\nWe'll see you again in high school!
Bring it on! You'll never know what hit you!
Ha! Good luck to you, too!
(That Jito guy is more than just big, he thinks\nbig, too. I could tell from playing against him.)
(Guess there are still plenty of tough opponents\nin Japan. I can't wait for high school.)
Both Minamiuwa and Hirado made it to the\ntop eight at Nationals.
Which is exactly why we can't lose here.
Get ready to be steamrolled by our skills!
Top eight? Who cares? That's luck in the brackets.
I sure hope ya don't think that puts us on the\nsame level.
What do you--?!
WE'RE the ones who're gonna do the steamrolling\ntoday!
Those words will be your dinner when this match\nis over!
Sounds like you really got to him.
That was the point.
Wouldn't even be worth my time without 'em\ncoming full force right outta the gate.
True.
Alright, then let's follow suit!
Woohoo! We did it!
Our total domination's off to a great start!
Ugh... We didn't hold anything back either...
Minamiuwa had some surprises.\nBut you weren't the only ones givin' it your all.
So you're saying we clashed head on,\nand you came out on top...
I hate to admit it, but it's our loss today.
But we'll get you next time!\nLet's have a rematch in high school!
Lookin' forward to it.
Anyway, good luck ahead!
You too!
...
What's gotten into you, Ishida? You look... happy.
That Jito guy sure is strong. But it's the kinda\nstrength that makes me wanna take him on again.
Takei, we have to get even better,\nso we can beat him in high school!
I had the same idea!
Ugh... the match from two days ago must've hit me\nsomething fierce. My muscles are still achin'.
Yeah, same here.
So this is what really laying it all on the line\nfeels like.
Guess so. When you put it like that,\nit doesn't seem so bad.
Come on guys, this is no time to be resting\non our laurels.
He's right. This tournament's just gettin'\nstarted. What comes next is what counts.
So pull yourselves together and let's hit the\nfield for some hard training!
Right behind you!
Everyone's really putting their heart into it\ntoday, huh?
Hard work can be really fun, after all.
Besides, nothing fires a soccer player up more\nthan getting to face real top notch players.
Bring it on, Sano!
The two of us'll stop you!
Here I come, Shinji!
C'mon!
Bring, brang, brung it!
...Wait, which Shinji?
You're open!
Whoops... Guess it was me.
I can't believe that worked.\nYou guys need to focus.
Gah... I've got no excuses.
Good as ever, Sano.
You too, <avatar_name>.
Now, bring it like you mean it!
Jus' try an' stop me!
You think ya can stop me with THAT?!
Please, one more time!
I won't give up until I win!
You bet! As many times as it takes!
That's what I like ta hear!
But ya can't just keep chargin' in like an idiot,\n<avatar_name>! You gotta use your head!
...Looks like he's having as much fun going up\nagainst Jito as ever.
Heck, Jito seems to be enjoying himself, too.
That's for sure.
Were it someone he saw as weak,\nhe wouldn't give a hoot.
But if he's willing to face off so many times,\n<avatar_name> must really be something special.
Hey! Himeji! Hatakeyama!\nWhat're you slackin' off for?!
Uh oh!
Okay Himeji, how about we practice penalty kicks?
Sure thing!
Kay guys, we're done for today!
Thank you, Captain!
Nice hustle out there, <avatar_name>!\nSee you tomorrow!
Yo, <avatar_name>, you must be exhausted!
Can't... Move a muscle...
I-I can keep going!
I don't doubt it. If you could keep going\nfull-force all day and not get tired\nI'd think you were a robot or something.
Drop the tough guy act,\nyour face gives it all away.
Still, I'm amazed you can tough it out.\nIt's the same stuff the rest of us did all year.
Maybe a first year like you wouldn't know,\nbut the club wasn't like this last year.
None of were this desperate to win. And most of\nall, Jito hardly ever showed up to practice.
The coach noticed his talent, and made him\ncaptain so he'd commit himself, but...
Jito loved fighting more than anything, and just\nkept picking fights with middle schoolers and high\nschoolers. Anyone who seemed tougher than him.
I can picture that.
He was infamous in elementary school.
Yeah, it's not hard.
Seriously? Even there?
Well, I guess they'd just be rumors.
Anyway, Jito's super strong, so eventually no one\ncould satisfy his desire to fight.
That's when Sano showed him a soccer magazine\nand told him about Tsubasa.
Tsubasa Ozora, two-time national soccer champ at\nNankatsu. Told him that beating Tsubasa was the\ngoal of every soccer kid in the country.
Jito was starved for tough opponents,\nso hearing that perked him right up.
The very next day, he came to the club and\ndeclared that his goal was to defeat Nankatsu.\nTo defeat Tsubasa Ozora.
At first we were just surprised,\nlike "where did this come from?"
But Jito was serious. More serious than you can\nimagine. He started getting everyone to do this\nkiller training.
He's always saying "my hobby is toppling the\nstrong," but that really resonated with us.
We all bought into it, and piled on the training\nfor a full year with a single goal:\ndefeat Nankatsu: defeat Tsubasa.
It must be tough for a first year to join the club\nand suddenly get subjected to all this training.
Some people even quit the club from how tough it\nwas, so for you to stick through it is pretty\namazing.
So let's go all out and win the\nJunior Hero League, together!
Don't work TOO hard though.\nWouldn't want you collapsing!
298... 299... 300!
Phew... Done with sit-ups.
Hey, <avatar_name>! Runnin' at a time like this?
After trainin' all day, too...\nYa really love this stuff, huh?
You're training too, Jito.
I thought you'd hate training.
What'd ya expect?!
Eh, it's a pain, but what're ya gonna do?
If I wanna beat tough guys, nothin's more\nimportant than puttin' in the effort to get\nbetter.
Besides...
...Nah, forget it.
Anyway, since yer here, let's train together!
I'd love to!
Can I handle it?
Good answer!
How're ya gonna know if ya never try?
Now, stop whinin' and give it a shot!
Alright, let's get started!
Phew... Guess we'll leave it at that for today.
Not bad, <avatar_name>!\nKeepin' up with my muscle training an' all.
Got high hopes for ya.\nBoth in the tournament and for next year.
Gotta carry the torch for the Hirado soccer club!
Been lookin' forward to our match with ya,\nTachibanas.
Let's see whose combo is better: me and the\ncaptain, or the famous Tachibana brothers!
You're challenging us to a combo contest?\nYou've got guts, I'll give you that.
Then, I guess we'll have to show you\nhow much better we are than you!
Hatakeyama, watch out for their attack.
Specially that Skylab Hurricane whatsit.\nEven I couldn't stop that weirdness.
Gotcha. But it doesn't matter what kind of shot it\nis, it still has to get past me.
Stay focused!
Sounds like ya get it. I'll leave it to ya!
Dang, we lost...
They weren't kidding about that Jito\nand Sano combo...
Thank you!
Fightin' tough guys is always a good time,\nbut unique opponent ain't half bad either.
You're pretty unique yourself, you know.
Seriously. Hirado feels like it's practically\n"Jito's Team" at this point.
Tough act to follow, huh Sano?\nYou're taking over next year, right?
What?
Um, yes, but...
...
Whoops. We shouldn't overstay our welcome, huh?
Later. Let's meet as reps next time!
Darn right! See ya there!
Hey, Kazuo.
Yeah?
Did I say something wrong?\nSano made quite the face back there.
I mean, it's always tough when a team relies\nso much on one guy. That's how it goes.
And it's not somebody else's problem either. We've\ngotta raise someone to take over Hanawa, too.
Yeah...
Yo. Been looking forward to going up against\nHirado's Jito.
Same to you, Azumaichi's Soda.
Don't see many defenders who can play offense,\nas well. Let's do this, you and me!
Soda. Pay too attention to the captain, and...
...I'll steal a goal right under your nose.
Then, I'll take you both together!
It's like he didn't even notice the rest of us.
All the more reason it's our time to shine.
He can't stop all of us on his own.\nLet's teach him a lesson!
Soda! I win our duel!
Fine, fine, I lost...
Jito and Sano aside, I never would've guessed\nthe rest of the team was that good.
Hirado really is "Jito's Team."\nHe's carrying a lot of weight.
But it'll be rough for you next year, huh?
What?
Ah, my bad. Shouldn't have said that.
Good luck ahead!
(Next year?)
...
Alright guys, listen up!
Meiwa Higashi and Hanawa are household names\nin this country, and we beat 'em both.
Meiwa Higashi and Azumaichi are household names\nin this country, and we beat 'em both.
Minamiuwa and Hanawa proved 'emselves at\nNationals, and we beat 'em both.
Minamiuwa and Azumaichi proved 'emselves at\nNationals, and we beat 'em both.
But we're just gettin' started! I need ya to fire\nyerselves up even MORE and keep followin' me!
All the way!
Jito's really getting into this.
You think he'd get bored and cut corners when he's\nwinning, but he hasn't done that once this whole\ntime.
Must be another influence, huh?
C'mon, come at me!
One more time!
Bwuh?!
Not half bad.
Do it like that again, <avatar_name>!
I suppose with the new kid coming after him every\nday like that, he doesn't have time to ease up.
I'm still surprised at how much <avatar_name>'s\nimproved!
Can't hurt that he's been seriously going at it\nwith a stronger opponent this whole time.
Well, we can't let ourselves fall behind,\ncan we Noda?
No way!
Jito, let us in on this too!
You bet! All three of ya, come at me at once!
You're up, Sano!
(I'm going to have to take over as the captain\nof Hirado!)
Here I go!
Ah...
What's wrong, Sano? Your shots are usually way\nsharper than that. And more controlled, too.
Haha... You're right. Sorry, just slipped up a\nlittle.
I'll do it right next time!
...
Kay guys, that's all for today! Get outta here!
Thank you, Captain!
Hey, Jito, about Sano...\nDoesn't it seem like something's bothering him?
Yeah. It feels like he's forcing his plays.\nLike he's trying to overdo it.
Ya think so, too?
Must be what the Tachibanas told him last match.
Must be what Soda told him last match.
...I see. Next year, huh?
Without us, the level of the team'll go way down,\nand Sano's gonna have to pull them up himself.
But if he's so worried about it,\nwhy not give him some advice?
Yeah, I'm sure he'd listen to you, Jito.
Nah, can't do that.
If he's gonna lead the team next year, if it's\ngonna be "Sano's Team" from here on out...
...Then, he's gotta solve this without me.
Heck, bet he feels that way himself.\nNever asked me nothin'.
Makes sense.
He may seem lost right now,\nbut honestly he's just as strong-willed as Jito.
You've really been watching him, huh Jito?
You bet.
(You ain't wrong, Sano.)
(But we're different, me and you.\nThis ain't somethin' you take on all by yourself.)
(That's why I gotta...)
Furano's Matsuyama, huh? I got to see ya at\nNationals. Yer a real fighter.
Made me wanna take ya on, personally.
I could say the same to you, Jito.
It's a fact that you were good enough to toy with\nNankatsu. With Tsubasa.
But no matter how tough the opponent, our teamwork\nwill tear apart whatever you bring against us!
Teamwork, is it? We're no slouches, either!
Yup. We'll take them head on using everything\nwe've got!
(Furano MS, trained by the guy even Jito sees as\na worthy opponent, Matsuyama...)
(The skills I've been developing will destroy\nthem!)
...
Alright! That's three in a row!
No one can stop us now!
Ugh... So this is Jito's...\nEr, Hirado's real skill!
Sure, we won, but ya sure didn't make it easy.\nYa made me sweat plenty of times back there.
Yer the real deal, Matsuyama.
You took the words right out of my mouth.\nYou and your team have got what it takes to win\nthe whole shebang.
Incidentally, this is about Sano, but...
Was it just me, or were his moves less sharp\nthan they were back at Nationals?
...Eh, he's got a lot goin' on.
I see. Well, I suppose there's pressure to being\na second year on a team this good.
(Oho. Saw right through it, huh?\nJust the man I thought he was.)
Anyway, let's both do our best in our last three\nmatches!
You bet! We'll see each other again as reps!
So Misugi's sitting out the first half again?
Maybe we'll already have won by then!
Don't look down on us. No matter how tight a\ndefense you've got, the three of us will break\nthrough it!
Musashi's Misugi, huh? I saw yer match in the\nTokyo Regionals. Yer just as good as Tsubasa.
Made me wanna compete with ya some time.
I could say the same to you, Jito.
It was pretty impressive how you toyed with\nTsubasa and Nankatsu like that.\nI'm looking forward to this.
Heard 'bout your heart condition.\nBut don't expect any mercy in a match!
Just what I wanted to hear.\nLet's have a good game!
(Musashi MS, trained by the guy even Jito sees\nas a worthy opponent, Misugi...)
(The skills I've been developing will destroy\nthem!)
...
Alright! That's three in a row!
No one can stop us when we get rolling!
Dang... So this is what Hirado's capable of...
I thought I understood your strength,\nbut you surpassed my expectations. What a team.
Especially you, Jito. You're definitely worthy of\nrepresenting Japan. I enjoyed our match.
That's my line. They don't call ya the\nYoung Noble of the Field for nothin'.
By the way, Sano...
Wh-What?
Your play today was lacking something compared\nto Nationals.
How do I put this? It was like you were\nforcing yourself to use more strength.
Y-You think? I'm not, though.
Well, there are so many girls in the audience\ntoday, so maybe I was trying to show off...
Anyway, good luck with your next match, Misugi!
Jito.
...Eh, he's got a lot goin' on.
I suppose it's only natural,\nif he's to inherit a team like yours.
(Jun Misugi. Ya give me honor student vibes,\nbut ya got a good head on yer shoulders.)
Alright. Three matches to go.\nLet's give it all we've got!
I hear that! See ya again when we're reps!
That night...
Who could it be at this hour?
Is it... a ghost?!
Ha!
No, this isn't right!
Hey, <avatar_name>.\nWhat are you doing out so late?
Ah, I see. You were out running, but then you\nheard me and came to see what I was up to?
What? You thought I was a ghost?!
A soccer-playing ghost...\nWouldn't have thought of that.
You're pretty awesome, you know that,\n<avatar_name>? However much you practice,\nthat's exactly how much better you get.
...
Hey, can I talk to you about something?
I'm all ears!
Wouldn't you rather talk to Jito?
Thanks.
Well, I wanna talk to you since we'll be playing\ntogether next year.
As you saw, the position I played in at Nationals\nthis summer was "captain's partner."
Nothing sums it up better than my goal against\nNankatsu.
But that was a strategic success. We only\nscored because we hid our power until that\nmatch and hit 'em with a surprise attack.
The fact that Ishizaki, Morisaki, and Tsubasa took\nnotice and blocked it in the second half proves\nI didn't have the skills I really need on my own.
And next year when the captain's gone\nI'll need to be able to score on my own.
Thankfully, having the captain and the other\nthird years around, the team's on a winning spree.
So, since I'm able to focus on myself right now,\nI wanna work on my skills.
Next year, I wanna be able to lead Hirado MS to\ndecisive victories, the way the captain does.
At least, that's what was going through my mind\nrecently when I was trying to put more power into\nmy plays.
But it hasn't been working out.
I must be doing something wrong.
How did you feel practicing this year?
What was your motivation this summer?
This year?
This summer? You mean for Nationals?
Well, yeah, it was all to beat Nankatsu.\nTo beat Tsubasa Ozora.
Really, I was the one who told the captain about\nTsubasa.
Oh, did Himeji and the others tell you? I see.
In those days, the captain was so strong that\nfighting started to get old. He was looking for\nsomething he could get serious about.
He's not the only one who feels strongly about\novercoming a tough opponent.
And then he got way more serious about soccer\nthan I expected. It was awesome.
This year we've been able to get stronger because\nof his dedication, and it drove us to us work\nhard.
Then, why not do that again?
It's nice having a rival, huh?
Do it again, eh?
You mean find a rival and strive to be as good?
I will admit, it was just us one-sidedly setting\nsomeone up as our rival.
Hmm... A rival.
...
Heh.
What? No practice today?
Yep. Instead, we're all gonna go scout out the\ncompetition.
Aren't we better off practicing?
I wanna grab souvenirs!
Don't be like that. Studying our opponents\nis important.
Yep, soccer's not like fightin'. You gotta do\nyer homework on your biggest competition.
Are ya kiddin' me? This ain't fun and games.
Hey, I'm up for it. To tell the truth,\nmy folks asked me to get somethin' fer 'em.
Fine! We'll make some time for it.
Woohoo!
Also, you get different info from a video\nthan you do from seeing it live.
True. Particularly, you can't pick up on a team's\nvibes during a match from a video.
<avatar_name>, if you can learn to pick up on\nthose, you'll be one fierce player!
Alright. Let's get a move on!
Look at 'em go. So, this is what Otomo's like.
They weren't at Nationals,\nbut they're not half bad.
Jito and Sano, you guys saw 'em in Shizuoka,\nright? How are they now compared to back then?
I got the impression they were a decent team,\nbut just okay. They've gotten way stronger.
What?!
Really?!
Don't underestimate me just 'cause I'm younger.
The forward's shot was intense, but he caught it.\nThat goalie's got perception and reflexes.
Here it goes!
Gotcha! Kishida!
On it!
What?!
How's this?!
Gotcha! Kishida!
On it!
What?!
Even Tsubasa had trouble with that midfield\ndefense, and it's gotten tighter than before.
You're mine! Falcon Shot!
You're mine! Falcon Shot!
But most of all, Nitta's gotten incredibly good.\nHe's gotta have undergone some gruelin' trainin'.
I gotta say, there's not a whole lotta forwards\nlike that anywhere.
And the defense puts some serious pressure on the\nplayer with the ball. They attack with this drive\nlike, "that ball is ours."
(Nitta and Ichijo are both in my year.)
...
Looks like the match is over.
And Otomo wins. They're good, man.
Alright. On to the next class!
This is Toho Academy?!
Their soccer facilities are on another level\ncompared to Hirado MS. That's a soccer school fer\nya.
Ya know, we were supposed to come here before\nNationals, but we didn't have the scratch for it.
We spent almost all we'd saved up on the\nround-trip to Shizuoka alone.
Their skills are top tier! Not that I'm surprised.
Bada-boom!
Whoa...
That was the Tiger Shot?!
We ain't gonna win if we can't stop that.
This is the kinda fight I'm lookin' for.
Wakashimazu's defense, Hyuga and Sorimachi's\nattack... and Sawada supportin' all o' that.
It's mine!
Rats!
Koike!
And that's a first year?!
If he took over our midfield, even we'd have\na tough time squelching that pest.
(Takeshi Sawada. He's just a first year, but he's\nalready a key player in a prestigious team.)
...
Okay, 'bout time we head back to the dorms!
Okay, 'bout time we head back...
Jito!
I know. 'Kay, Let's go check out the knick-knacks!
But ya better not cause any trouble!
We should be telling you that!
Don't go picking a fight if you see someone\nwho looks tough.
Gahahaha!
Shut yer yap and let's go!
Sorry to have you train with me so late,\n<avatar_name>.
Did you come up with anything?
Dude, I'm good anytime!
Yeah. I think I found a solution to my recent\ntroubles during our scouting around today!
You're a real good guy!
Guess what. I think I found a solution to my\nrecent troubles during our scouting around today!
Nitta's got a fast, powerful shot. Ichijo's got\nsolid saves. Sawada's got technique and an eye\nfor strategy.
They all play with a strong conviction to lead\ntheir respective teams while using their unique\ntalents.
I thought I needed to get stronger to take over\nthe team the captain built up.
But what I needed was to play to my talents and\nto have that level of conviction.
Those guys are gonna be our rivals as we go for\nNationals next year.
So, I'm gonna do like you said and aim to best\nthem.
Starting now, I'm gonna learn to play,\ntaking advantage of my unique strengths.\nI'm gonna beat those guys!
By the way, what do you think my strengths are?\nWhat do I do better than most?
Your technique.
Your agility.
Being short.
Well, you're not wrong, but what's important is\nthe quality of it.
Yes, that's exactly it!
Oh, come on...
I mean, you're not wrong,\nbut you didn't have to dish it like that.
A-Anyway, point taken. You're right, in a sense.
I'm on the shorter side of things,\nso I can respond quickly and be snappier.\nMy legs got swivel like no one's ever seen!
I'd used that to play circles around people\nbefore, but now I gotta take it a step further.
Tight motions are harder to read, right? So, I'll\nmake my kicks as compact as it gets, and on top\nof that, concentrate my body's power into them.
I figured I'd try to master a small, quick,\nyet powerful shot in that vein.
As far as the speed I'm looking at, the fastest\nswing I've witnessed was Tsubasa's Drive Shot.
That'll be my goal. I'm gonna figure out a move\nat least comparable to that.
I'm gonna start practicing shots. If you notice,\nanything--anything at all--sock it to me!
Hmm, that's not quite right.
How were my movements just now?
Your leg's swing is too wide.
Your hip might be opening too much.
Meaning my leg's going too wide, right?
Ohh, okay. That's why it felt like I lost power\nfrom my center.
So, that means...
Ah! It's the hip!
That's it! That's why my leg was going the long\nway around and it felt like I lost power from\nmy center.
I gotta be more careful with the hip than the\nthigh if I want to kick the shortest distance\nto the ball.
Okay, in that case!
How long do you think Sano and <avatar_name>\nare gonna practice?
They've been at it since before I did my homework,\nso it's been... about three hours already.
Jito, you think maybe we should stop 'em?
Right now, Sano's so fired up even I couldn't stop\n'im.
Sano... <avatar_name>...
Dang it!
My leg's got the shortest distance down,\nand I'm getting the power into the leg.\nAll that's left is the impact!
You've nearly got it!
Maybe you should break...
Tak! There's no way I can stop now!
No. I can't!
I appreciate your concern, but I'm so close\nI can taste it, and if I stop now, I'll lose it!
I'm doing this. I'm gonna go all the way!
(My body's totally beat.\nI've got almost no strength left.)
(But that's why... That's why I'm gonna squeeze\nout every ounce of strength I have and focus it\ninto the point of impact!)
GO!
That... That was it!
I swung at the ball using the shortest distance\nand concentrated my whole body's power into the\nimpact. I finally did it!
You nailed it!
Now to register it to muscle memory!
I did! Thanks for your help, <avatar_name>!
Now, gimme just a little more of your time.\nI want to really get the feeling down!
You got it! Help me just a little longer.
Looks like he finally pulled it off!
That took some real grit. Big respect!
(I knew ya had it in ya Sano, <avatar_name>.)
(Ya won't catch me laggin' behind, though.)
I've been looking forward to this match, Hirado.
I hope you're ready. Toppling giants is what Otomo\ndoes. It's our motto.
Heh...
What's so funny?
See, that motto of yers just so happens to be\na hobby of mine.
So, let's see whose conviction is stronger.\nLet this be a battle of titans!
I wouldn't want it any other way!
Hey, Sano. I've looked forward to our meeting!\nYou're a second-year forward just like me!
I took the liberty of studying your attack\npatterns, so don't expect to score any points\ntoday!
We'll see about that.
Oh, but do give it a good try!
Laugh it up while you can!\nWe'll see how it turns out at the last whistle!
(Nitta... Ichijo. I will beat you today.\nThis is what all that intense training was for!)
Sano?
What's up?
We'll keep the Otomo Quartet busy.
And you can count on the defense locking down\nNitta.
Just let him try that Falcon Shot or whatever!\nI'll be waiting!
Sano, you'll be free to go all out against\nNitta and Ichijo!
Hit 'em hard with your game and show 'em who's\nthe boss.
Guys...
You got it! We're gonna win this!
Crud! I can't believe you guys overwhelmed us\nlike that. Hirado, you guys are strong!
I tell ya what, the reason we were able to play\nburning from our strongest emotions!
In other words, it was actually us who helped you\npower up like that, huh? Joke's on us, I guess.
Either way, we fought as hard as we could,\nso it sucks, but it was still a lotta fun.
By the way, your goalie, Ichijo, was it?
Y-Yes?
Hard to believe you're a second-year bein' built\nlike that. And you know how to use it, too.
You're gonna go far if you train hard.\nSo, don't go slackin' off!
I won't! Thank you!
Sano, you're the winner today.
I didn't think you could pull off a shot that\nsharp with such a small motion.
Thanks.
But you know, it's thanks to you and Ichijo that\nI was able to get that movement down.
Come again?
I didn't wanna lose to second-years like me. And\nI'm going after that championship next year, too.
Ah, I hear that.
Well, get ready for payback come Nationals\nnext year! It's gonna be good!
I knew you were tough when I saw you at Nationals,\nbut I didn't think you were this tough!
That's me.
We may've lost today, but in the end, this was\njust an exhibition match. We'll be fighting for\nthe championship at Nationals next year!
For sure! Couldn't ask for more!
Catch ya later.\nGood luck on the rest of your matches!
See ya when we're reps!
Heads up, Shinji!
That's not gonna work anymore!
We'll stop you this time!
I thought you'd say that!
Heads up, <avatar_name>!
What?!
Go for it, Sano!
What Sano wants is... this!
I've got this!
Right on the money! Good pass!
We did it!
Wow... That combination was perfect.
You guys make a good duo.
(Hmm, they might be ready.)
The flow from <avatar_name>'s pass to Sano's shot\nwas perfect.
Thanks.
If ya guys are that in tune with each other,\nya should be able to pull off you-know-what.\nAm I right?
By you-know-what...
You don't mean our combination shot, do you?
You bet I do.
<avatar_name>, in the next practice match,\ntry a shot essentially the same as that pass.
And don't worry about settin' it up for Sano.\nIf the shot's weak, it ain't gonna work.
Just believe in Sano and slam it.\nIf yer really partners, it'll be second nature.
Alright, do it to it!
Practice Match...
Here comes the shot!
(I believe in you, Sano!)
Alright! <avatar_name>!
I'm blown away! I didn't think you'd get it\non the first try. Ya guys are somethin' else!
Wait, was that Jito and Sano's...
Those two really learned to coordinate perfectly!
I thought Hirado MS was gonna be Sano's team\nfrom now on, but it might end up being\nSano and <avatar_name>'s team.
We might actually win Nationals next year!
(Sano and <avatar_name> have grown more than I\nthought.)
(Can't let them get a leg up on me if we're gonna\ntake down our strongest opponents.)
Kay that's it for practice today! Get outta here!
Thanks, Captain!
Sano, <avatar_name>, ya two mind stayin' a bit?
S-Sure. I don't mind.
Thanks.
What are we doing, Captain?
So, I want ya to help me with some special\ntrainin'.
What do you have in mind?
Well...
We're up against Toho Academy next.\nHyuga's Tiger Shot is at least as strong as\nTsubasa's Drive Shot.
Whether or not I can stop it is gonna be a key\nfactor in that match.
This is the kinda bout I'd been wantin'.\nThe bigger my foe, the more I burn.
That said, durin' Nationals, I was overpowered by\nthe Drive Shot, and I got driven into the goal.
Captain...
If we're gonna win this league, I can't be makin'\na mess o' myself like that again.
I'm gonna stop that Tiger Shot. I've trained\nand built my abs up for this.
And with this practice, I'm gonna put the final\nglaze on my muscle armor!\nI want you two to shoot right at me!
Okay!
Fire in the hole!
Guh... Sano, ya squirt, ya really powered up.
Okay, gimme what ya got, <avatar_name>!
Oof!
Shoulda known. That's the kinda force I expect\nfrom someone who learned straight from Hyuga.
Oof!
As expected... That's some real power.\nNo surprise after learning from Tsubasa himself.
Oof!
Now, there's a shot with some serious grit cooked\nin.
Oof!
The spin on that thing...\nIt was as clean as a Drive Shot.
Oof!
That shot...\nIt wasn't just fast, it was powerful, too.
Oof!
Atta boy. That packed a decent punch,\nif I do say so myself, havin' trained ya.
Oh, look. You guys were doing special training,\ntoo?
Himeji!
Guess the team's all on the same wavelength.
What do ya mean?
What do you think? We're here for some extra\ntraining!
There are two matches left in the Junior Hero\nLeague, and they're against none other than\nToho Academy and Nankatsu.
They're teams we may not be able to beat even\nif we play as hard as we can.
So, we all decided we're gonna practice until\nwe're confident we stand a chance.
Alright.
You guys aren't the only ones lookin'\nto battle the toughest opponents.
Ya guys...
These are the teammates I've been trainin'\nfer a year!
All that to say, Sano, <avatar_name>,\nwould you guys help us with our training?
Any shot Jito's unable to block has to be stopped\nby me. So, I wanna practice against the meanest\nkicks I can.
Wait a minute. What about my trainin' then?
C'mon, man. We're here, aren't we?
That's right. We're gonna help with your training\nbefore we get to ours!
Let's get this party, I mean, training started!
Okay, Captain, we're gonna train with Hatakeyama,\nso we leave things here to you guys!
Leave it to us!
Alright, Jito. Zróbmy to!
Today we pay you back for all the training you've\ngiven us. Hope you like it!
Nice! Gimme all ya got!
Agh. That smarts.
I know I said all ya got, but that was a real barn\nburner. Even fighting doesn't leave me hurtin'\nthis much.
Well, we rarely get a chance to kick the ball\nat you for real.
You guys settling a score?
Nice of you to give back!
Yeah, that's what this is.
Hmm, I think it's more like settling a score.
Come on, Sano, we wouldn't do that.
All we did was reciprocate Jito with the strength\nhis training gave us! We're returning a favor!
I will say, it felt real good!
(Your true intentions are showing, Noda.)
You guys are messed up.
Okay, Jito, next up, help us out with our\ntraining, will ya?
Eh?
We're gonna be up against Toho Academy\nand Nankatsu's tough-as-nails defense.
We were thinking of training for it on our own,\nbut we figured it'd be more effective to do it\nagainst you, but ya know, when you're serious.
Yeah, if we can learn to challenge you without\nflinching, Toho and Nankatsu won't scare us.
So, Jito. Take us on!
I hear ya.
Well, you asked for it! And ya got me motivated.\nHere comes the beast!
Oh, it's on!
We're gonna crush you!
That's my <avatar_name>.
That's what I expect to hear from ya,\n<avatar_name>.
Don't let this guy one-up ya! Don't hold anythin'\nback! Go for the kill! Ya hear me?!
Tak!
Owww! Jito's power really is incredible.
I almost feel sorry for whoever's up against him.
But attacking Toho and Nankatsu won't be as scary\nknowing their defense won't be this bad.
Thanks, Jito.
No need to thank me.
(Gotta give it to 'em. Attackin' my defense\nrepeatedly without fear? Those guys are\nunstoppable.)
(I sure got myself some good pals.)
Ya guys ready to call it a day?
Jito, Sano, <avatar_name>... You guys go on ahead.\nWe'll take care of clean up.
Oh? Are you sure?
Yeah. You guys have been practicing for longer\nthan we have.
Rest up well. Get your energy back.
Guess I'll go on ahead, then. Thanks!
Yeah. Let's keep at it tomorrow!
Hey, is it just me or have we gotten way better\nsince the Junior Hero League started?
I think you're right. We've been practicing harder\nthan we ever did, and our game's improved for\nsure.
Why do you think that is, though?
You know, it's probably thanks to <avatar_name>.
You think so?
Yeah, since Nationals, I think the reason we made\nit that far was because Jito was leading us,\ngetting us to practice.
Now that you mention it, we used to just go along\nwith his crazy training.
But <avatar_name> is actually going after Jito\nhimself to try and improve.
I've been wondering if that hasn't rubbed off\non us.
It's true we've been practicing more on our own\nnow.
I guess that's the difference between passive and\nproactive. Not that we were slacking off before,\nbut you know...
Now that you mention it, Sano also teamed up with\n<avatar_name> to power up for next year.
Maybe <avatar_name> has the power to change\na team, like Jito does.
Yeah, maybe that's it.
It feels like we're all fighting together more\nthan we did during Nationals.
All the more reason I want things to end on a high\nnote.
You said it.
We've only got two matches left with this team.
This is for ourselves and to help Hirado MS be\nthe National champions next year...
And for Jito, Sano, and <avatar_name>!\nLet's pour in every ounce of effort we can!
Tak!
Right. Okay, now it's time to clean up together.
I've been looking forward to this day,\nKojiro Hyuga.
Let's see which is stronger,\nyour Tiger Shot or my Power Block.
There's no force in the universe that can stop\nmy Tiger Shot.
I'm kicking this like I'm trying to scare you off\nthe field! Hope you're ready for that!
Can't wait to see you try! I ain't backin' down!
(From what I can see, Hyuga's not the kinda guy\nwho backs down from a fight.)
(If this gets him to go after me,\nit'll lower the chances of them scoring.)
(So, come at me, Hyuga!\nHirado's gonna win this one!)
I wonder if you'll be able to keep up with me,\nSawada.
Your technique's on point, I'll give you that.\nBut you're not shutting me down!
I've been studying you, Sano.\nYou bring the chaos, but not today!
I'm gonna be shouldering Toho Academy next year,\nso I can't lose to you! It all goes down today!
(I'll be carrying a team next year, too. And\nyou're the one going down today. No matter what!)
We did it! We really did it!
We beat this year's National champs!
No way... I can't believe we lost!
Did ya see that, Hyuga?!\nWe're natural Davids taking down Goliaths!
Hey, Sano.
Sawada.
Hirado's spirit was incredible today.\nYou taught me how scary it can be to be the\nchampions being pursued.
But I won't let this experience go to waste.\nWe're the defending champs and next year\nwe're gonna win!
That gets me fired up, too! I look forward to it!
The night before the last day\nof the Junior Hero League
I can't sleep.
I couldn't be more awake right now.
...
That you, <avatar_name>?\nWhat are ya doin' up at this hour?
Me? I'm just a lil' lost in thought.
You have thoughts? What thoughts?
What are you thinking about?
Wow, okay... Hey, I'm a middle schooler with\nthings on my mind just like anyone.
Anywho, you're bound to be Hirado's captain\neventually, so listen up.
There's some stuff 'bout stuff before the league\nstarted.
Before the Junior Hero League began, Himeji\nand company told me they wanted to realize\nand use their whole potential.
I doubt it was their intention, but when\nthey said they'd do play with all they had,\nit got me right in the feels.
Ya probably remember, but when we played Nankatsu\nback at Nationals, we had a huge lead in\nthe first half.
Back then, I thought I had Tsubasa and Nankatsu's\nstrength all sized up.
With that in mind, even though everyone was pinin'\nfor another point, I had everyone reel it in\nfor the second half.
But I'd underestimated Tsubasa and Nankatsu,\nand I got careless.
Then with no way to counter it, my dumb butt\nlet Tsubasa score with his Drive Shot,\nand Nankatsu rode that momentum to victory.
In the end, Kisugi and Taki did me in.\nI learned what it was like to be on the\nlosin' side of a comeback.
And this was after takin' everyone through\ngruelin' trainin' under the banner of beatin'\nNankatsu and Tsubasa Ozora.
I was the one who held everyone back in that\nmatch. I'm the one who crushed everyone's dreams.
Maybe things mighta turned out different\nif I hadn't been careless and kept us tryin'\nto score in the second half.
That was really hurtin' before the\nJunior Hero League started.
So, as a man and as captain, I vowed this time\nI'd make everyone's dream a reality.
As it stands, I'm just a big fat liar.\nI gotta lead us to take down Nankatsu and\nTsubasa Ozora for everyone's sake!
Wh-What's goin' on?!
Dang, that was one passionate speech, Jito!
That's our captain!
When did you guys--?!
We've been here for a while, but you got really\nintense, so we didn't want to interrupt.
I've said this before, but we're only as\nstrong as we are now because you set a goal\nand pushed us toward it. You had a vision.
It's not like Hirado's soccer club was much of\na powerhouse. We weren't even in line to win\nthe Nagasaki regional finals.
If it weren't for you, we'd never have made it\nthis far or tried to win as big as we have.
We likely would've put in an okay effort to get\nokay results and that would've been the end of\nthe regional finals.
Yup. It was you who gave us big dreams and a big\ngoal to work for.
And this time, again, it's you who's pushing us\nand working super hard for it.
Jito, we're absolutely gonna beat Nankatsu\ntomorrow and make you the most legendary\ncaptain in all Japan!
Dang it, you guys...
You're gettin' me hyped up somethin' fierce.
Well, then let's end it my way. Let that fire in\nyou rage like it's got full forests to consume!
Tomorrow we're gonna be blazing!\nWe're gonna win the whole dang Junior Hero League!\nAre ya with me?!
Tak!
Now, let's get some shuteye.
We have some great teammates in the older players,\nwouldn't you say, <avatar_name>?
Let's thank them for all they've done for us.\nLet's use all we have to make their final middle\nschool soccer dreams come true!
We'll use our skills to make their final\nmiddle school soccer dreams reality\nRight, <avatar_name>?!
Sano and I are unstoppable!
Let's take down that Nankatsu giant!
My duo with Sano is still better than yours!
That's what I like to hear! Your greatest weapon\nis that fighting spirit of yours.
We're counting on you two, Sano, <avatar_name>!
Achoo!
Sano! I hope you're not catching a cold before\nour big game.
It's just a little chilly!\nAnyway, we should head back in.
Sano seems much more confident these days.
Let's not forget about <avatar_name>.\nThe two of them are really carrying the team.
Yeah.\nHirado's in good hands with those two around.
The only thing left for us to do is win tomorrow's\nmatch to lift this team's name to where it belongs\nfor both them and everyone else.
That's what I'm talking about!
We've gotta secure the win tomorrow and fulfill\nour dreams, as well as give a little juice to our\nteam's hopes next year.
Tak!
Today's finally here! What a beautiful summer sky!
Two teams will take the field, but only one will\nbe crowned champion of the Junior Hero League!\nWill it be Nankatsu or Hirado?
Nankatsu captain, Tsubasa Ozora, seems to\nhave recovered from his injuries at Nationals.
On the other side is Hirado MS, who gave them\na hard time at Nationals but lost in the end.
Hirado's back-to-back victories have been led by\nJito and Sano, and now they're granted a chance\nto redeem themselves against Nankatsu!
What's more, Hirado is joined by a wild card\nfirst-year player, who has played a key role in\nthe team's success in this league!
This will decide the ultimate, the best\nof the best, among the middle school teams!
Although this is an exhibition match,\neach is the champion of their league.\nThis is the de facto ultimate championship!
The match starts on the whistle!
Tsubasa, are you all better already?
Yeah, my shoulder and leg are fine.
That's good to hear.
If I'm gonna take on these tough guys, I wouldn't\nwant them making excuses for losing! Pretending\nthey were taking it easy on me or whatever.
You won't catch us off guard like last time! We're\nat our best, and we're not backing off the gas!
And I'll be the one stopping each and every one\nof your attacks!
As if! We're better than we were last time.
Nankatsu's Silver Duo will shatter your wall\nagain!
And I'll stop any combo play you guys try against\nus. Just a heads up for later!
Hirado's got more than just combo plays, you know.
And who's to say our plays haven't evolved\nsince last time we shared the field?
Taking home the championship of the\nJunior Hero League with a perfect win streak,\nit's the dark horse of the tournament!
No one can deny the strength of these heroes\nhailing from Nagasaki, it's Hirado MS!
We... lost.
I can't believe it. We...
We're the national champs.
We lost. To Hirado.
We pulled it off!
We won! We really won!
We finally beat Nankatsu!
Somebody pinch me.\nThis is really happening, right?
We did it Captain! <avatar_name>!
Tak!
We gone and done it. We beat Nankatsu.\nWe beat Tsubasa!
Aw yeah! We finally did it!
Overcoming a proper foe is everything!
You veterans sure pulled some weight!
Where's the live cam?
You can say that again.
I totally get how you feel, Jito.
Oh, stop. You were a big factor in us winning,\ntoo.
That's right. This is OUR victory!
You really crave the attention, don't you?\nI mean, I do, too.
Hey, over there! There's a camera that way!
You ready, <avatar_name>? We'll do a victory dance\nfor the folks watching! Idziemy!
Congratulations on a perfect sweep in the league,\nteam Hirado.
Tsubasa...
Look, when we dominated all three years at\nNationals, I figured I was done with Japan.\nI was going to move to Brazil and turn pro...
That's what I thought.
...
I was mistaken. In my heart, I'd gotten arrogant.
The desire to go up against a giant and beat\nthem... After winning three straight years at\nNationals, I'd lost that drive.
But today's match helped me remember a very\nimportant feeling that I get only from\nthe soccer pitch...
I never want to lose to anyone\nin the game I love so much.
Which is why I need to keep giving it\nmy all without becoming conceited.
Congrats, Hirado. That was a knockout performance.
Thank you, Tsubasa. We appreciate you as well.
Thanks to all teams who participated\nin this exhibition tournament!\nThe Junior Hero League is now over.
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament:\nIt's the newcomer from Hirado, <avatar_name>!
Not only that, he's also the top scorer of the\ntournament. It's a miraculous double crown, folks!
He shot through this league like a comet!\nHe is truly the "Junior Hero!"
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament: Somehow, it's the\nnewcomer from Hirado, <avatar_name>!
He shot through this league like a comet!\nHe is truly the "Junior Hero!"
The MVP of the tournament is\nHiroshi Jito, Hirado's team captain!
His huge stature led the team with such intensity\nthey took the Junior Hero League by storm with a\nperfect win streak!
And the top-scoring player of the tournament\nis the newcomer from Hirado, <avatar_name>!
He earned recognition by sweeping past strikers,\nwhich is all the more impressive!
The MVP of the tournament is\nHiroshi Jito, Hirado's team captain!
His huge body pumped out huge plays\nand powerful leadership.\nHe is the embodiment of Hirado's soccer!
We would like to recognize twenty-one\nincredible players from the Junior Hero League!
From Hirado MS, Jito, Sano, and <avatar_name>\nhave been chosen.
These twenty-one players will travel to\nthe United States to represent Japan\nin international competition.
Watch out! This new generation of players\nwill show the world what Japan can do!
Man, I can't think of a more perfect way to end\nour middle school soccer careers.
I thought it was the end for us after Nationals.\nI can't believe we got the chance to redeem\nourselves... and here we are.
Come to think of it, we spent the entire year\nplaying soccer in order to beat Nankatsu and\nTsubasa Ozora.
I can't believe how good it feels to be rewarded\nfor that hard work.
Jito, we really owe it all to you.\nYou're the best captain in all of Japan!
Come on, team!
Thank you, Captain!
S-Stop that, guys. You're embarrassing me.
Besides, I should be the one thanking all of you.
I joined this club because I was obsessed with\ntakin' down tough guys.
Thank you all for joining me on this journey.
If I'm the best captain in Japan,\nthat makes all of you the best team!
You taught me so much, Captain.
To lead with strength means you've got to be\ncommitted to carrying the team. I think I've\nlearned to do that during the tournament.
I may not be as physically big as you, but I have\nthe same heart. I know I can lead Hirado.
Just wait and I'll take this team to Nationals\nnext year and win it!
Sano, you don't have to carry the team alone.
He's right, you know. You've got an amazing\npartner in <avatar_name>.
These were just exhibition matches, but we beat\nout the best of the best without a single loss.\nThey'll be gunning for us next year!
<avatar_name>, you've gotta lead Hirado MS\nnext year along with Sano!
You can count on me!
I'll be the one leading Sano!
I'll follow Sano's lead!
We've got this, <avatar_name>!
That's what makes you, you, I guess.
We'll keep pushing each other,\nand the team will get stronger as a result.
Sounds a bit weak coming from you.
I don't want to hear any of this following\nbusiness. We'll push each other to new limits\nand lead together, partner!
(Heh. They definitely make a good duo.\nMakes me think of Sano and me.)
That's the spirit, Sano!
You first and second years need to keep up with\nSano, you hear?
Soccer is a team sport, and there is no "I" in\nteam! You need to get stronger together.
I look forward to hearing about you winning\nat next year's Nationals!
Tak!
Ah, before I forget, congrats on becoming\nJapan reps, Jito, Sano, and <avatar_name>.
Yep! Thanks so much!
They'd be dumb not to pick me with my skills.
The world stage... I'm just looking forward\nto what strength we can encounter there.
I can't wait to play against whoever!
We had no doubts that you and Sano would be\npicked.
But we're a bit surprised that even\n<avatar_name> made the team.
Seriously. He wasn't even a regular on the team a\nwhile ago, and now he's representing Japan!
I'm off to face global powerhouses!
I'm off to conquer global powerhouses!
This means I can skip school, right?!
Don't be satisfied just playing against them.\nIf you're going to go, be sure to beat them!
Of course! We'll be number one in the world!
Global powerhouses.\nI'm excited just at the thought!
Don't be silly, <avatar_name>.\nYou might miss school, but be sure to study or\nelse you'll regret it later.
That goes for you, too, Jito. Be sure to study for\nyour entrance exams while in America.
Else, we won't be in the same school next year.
I know, already. Don't worry about me!
(He's totally not going to study...)
We're giving you three all of our strength.
Take it and bring home that championship cup!
You got it!
With your hearts and grit behind us, we'll beat\nthose other countries' teams and be back with\nthe champ's cup before you can spit!
Just keep the lights on and the grub warm for us!
...
16th National MS Soccer Tournament\nTokyo Regional Semifinals
I did my best.\nI don't have any regrets...
Captain!
...!
"Junior Hero League"?
Yeah.
Next month, the Junior Youth World Challenge\nis being held in America.
It's an exhibition league to decide who will\nrepresent Japan in the big tournament.
I see. So it's just like a qualifying match!
And the school just got a call from the Soccer\nAssociation! The Musashi team is going to be in\nthe qualifiers! We get to go! Coach just said so!
Hmm... Can third-years like us still join in?
Yup! That's what Coach said.
C'mon, let's go check out the tournament bracket!
There're 14 teams taking part,\nsplit into two leagues of 7 teams each.
Which schools are in our half of the bracket?
Let's see... Furano, Toho, and Nankatsu.
Whoa...!
Jeez... Those schools have tough teams.
Duh. They're trying to pick who\nwill represent our whole country.\nYou can't expect easy competition.
Who cares who we're up against?\nMusashi is the best of the best!
We can't let them see any weakness from us.
(This is the same league that\nNankatsu Middle is in...)
(I could rematch Tsubasa...!)
Misugi?
Wait, don't tell me... Tsubasa?!
Hey guys, how're you?
Misugi! How long's it been?
Too long, Tsubasa.
Have you heard about this "Junior Hero League"?
I have, as a matter of fact. Musashi and Nankatsu\nare actually in the same tournament bracket.
Is that so?
Back in elementary school, I always wanted\na rematch with you, Misugi.\nBut I never got the chance...
Until now! I can't wait!
You said it! Me too!
It's going to be Nankatsu and Musashi\nfacing off in the finals!
Let's both stay in tip-top shape,\nso we can have the perfect match.
You're on, Tsubasa!
And let's take it one step further!\nIf we can, let's both make it to the finals\nwithout a single loss!
See ya soon, Misugi!
A battle to have the best winning streak...?\nYeah, that sounds like Tsubasa, all right.
That sure would be awesome.
(Except this time, our match isn't a\nregular game... It's just an exhibition.)
(If we both make it to the finals with zero\nlosses, I see no reason to lose the finals either!\nIt'll be a battle for the ages!)
(I'll bet that's what Tsubasa is thinking. He's\nthe kind of guy that would play a middle school\nsoccer tournament like his life depended on it.)
(Then again, this isn't just any tournament...\nIt's to decide who represents Japan!)
(Whether or not I get to live my dream of being\na player representing my home country abroad\nall depends on how hard I fight!)
Young man, is your name Misugi?
Uh, that's me, but who are you?
I'm Katagiri, and I'm with the\nJapan Soccer Association.
What?
Oh, the Soccer Association!\nWhat do you want with the Musashi team?
My business isn't with the Musashi team.\nIt's with you, Misugi.
What do you want with me...?
Next month, the Junior Youth World Challenge\nis being held in America.
Yeah, I've heard.
Good, then this conversation should be brief.
Young man, the Japan Football Association wants\nyou to be a representative sent to America.
What?
But isn't the whole Junior Hero League being\nheld to pick the representative?
The players are being picked that way, yes.
But we want to send you along as a coach.
A coach?!
I've had my eye on you ever since\nyou played in elementary school.
You're smart, you have good intuitions\nabout soccer, and above all, you can\ncalmly observe the people around you.
So why not have our representative players\nbe guided by a coach the same age as they are?
I could really be... a coach? No way...
And my dream to be on the representative team...\nI never thought it would happen this easily!
But there is the matter of your heart condition...
Well...
Competition from the other countries will be\nfierce. Every game requires you to push your body\nto its limit. And it will leave you exhausted...
We can only send players who're\nin perfect health. To do otherwise\njust puts the team at risk.
The same is true for you, young man.
Well, I can't deny what you're saying...
My heart has only gotten worse since\nelementary school. I can feel it...
My doctor only allowed me play after I\npromised to not stay in a match for too long.
But even if it sounds crazy, I can still play!\nI just have to manage my time on the field\nreally carefully!
...
I thought you might say something to that affect.
Huh?
Normally, even if you were to qualify you would\nbe very limited in what you could do.\nYou'd likely be turned away.
This would mean the representatives would have to\ngo without your skill and your eye for tactics.\nIt would be a big loss for the Japanese team.
That's why I wanted to tell you what you'll\nneed to do to be able to take part.
There's a way?
Participate in the six matches during the\nJunior Hero League, and play for only 30 minutes\nin each with every ounce of spirit you can muster.
If you can meet those two conditions,\nI'll consider letting you join the team.
R-Really?!
Really.
But don't neglect your health!\nIf you feel ill or your doctor tells you to stop,\nswap with another player immediately.
I've already spoken with the coach of the\nMusashi team. He's given his approval.
But like you said, it is a bit crazy.
I understand.
We need proof that your body is up to\nthe task. Can you provide us with that?
Of course!
Good. You'll need that kind of determination to\nbe a representative. I hope you're up to it.
See you in the Junior Hero League!
(Play against the strongest players in the\ncountry. Play for no longer than 30 minutes.\nPlay exceptionally...)
(It'll be tough going, but I can do it!)
(I'll face off with Tsubasa\nwith a perfect winning streak!)
(And we'll both be on the same team\nas representatives!)
Did you hear?
Tak!
Misugi...
The next day...
Let's go, Sanada!
Gah! What a bad shot!
My bad! I should've waited\nlonger before passing.
Nah, that one's on me. Keep up\nthat hustle on the next one too!
Keep up the pressure on defense, Kido!
Easier said than done!
Just keep hold of the ball\nuntil Misugi takes the field!
All right, time for the players to switch out!\nNow the first-years will take the field!
(Looking at the scorebook,\nMusashi's weakness is clear...)
(We spend the first half on the defensive,\nthen in the second half, I hafta come in\nand make up all the lost points...)
(When it comes down to it,\nthe whole team is depending on me.)
(But that has its drawbacks. I realized as much\nin the finals of the Tokyo tournament...)
Coach, let me go in!
If we don't get more goals,\nwe won't win the match!
(When we played Toho Academy, we conceded three\ngoals in the first half, so I had to swap in\nearly. But when I had to swap back out, we lost.)
(If we can't overcome this shortcoming,\nwe'll never win the Junior Hero League.)
Jun!
Ah! The team manager!
...
What are you doing?
W-Well... We'll be competing in the\nJunior Hero League soon. I was\nthinking of how to strengthen the team.
(Honma and the others are much better\nat going on the offensive.)
(They could aim for goals in the first half,\nbut if our opponent knows it's coming, it'll be\neasy for them to wall up and defend against.)
(So to make that tactic work, we'd need\nanother player who can lead the team without me.)
(But is there a player like that out there?)
Oh, what were you saying?
I said, it's time! Head for the soccer field!
Man, this is an uphill battle!
Darn it! This doesn't look good...\nWhy can't I get the ball?!
Who is this guy?!
He got it in! That was one nice goal!
Nice job, dude!
Isn't that whiz-kid just a first-year student?
(This first-year has definitely got skill,\nbut he has some rough edges, too.)
(He's strong enough to keep up with the\nolder kids, and he's totally focused on the\nball... There's something special about him.)
(Maybe he could be...)
All right! Huddle up, everyone!
To finish off today's practice, I want everyone\nto split into two groups, so we can scrimmage!
The groups will be...
Yo, new kid! You're <avatar_name>, right?
We haven't talked much, have we?\nJust a hello here and there.
Let me introduce myself. I'm Misugi, captain\nof the soccer club. I hope we'll get along!
<avatar_name>...
You were a forward, right?
You were a midfielder, right?
You were a defender, right?
That's the one! It's nice to meet you!
I'm glad I finally got your attention.
It's good to meet you properly.
D-Does this mean I've been chosen\nto be on the regular team?!
Even after practice, you're still full of\nenergy. You must have good stamina.
And you're clearly confident.
Make sure your confidence doesn't\nturn into recklessness, though.
Granted, you look pretty worn out...
But I bet that's because you practice so hard!
You know what?\nI think you have a bright future with us.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.\nFirst, we should talk.
Sorry to put you on the spot like this, but...\nShow me what you got.
In the practice match, join the same group as me.
In fact, I'll do the honors. Hey, Ichinose!\nPut <avatar_name> and me in the same group!
You got it!
All right, let's get going!
Not bad! Not bad at all.
(He had no trouble getting into the rhythm\nin the match, either. Hmmm...)
See me after practice, <avatar_name>.
After practice...
Sorry to make you stick around.
Truth be told, I want to see more of your skills.
So why don't we have a one-on-one match?
Of course! It'd be my pleasure!
Just don't be insulted if I win!
I get to personally face-off against\nMisugi?!
Good answer!
I admire your confidence and pluck!
Now let's see if you've got the skill\nto back up those words!
Enough chit-chat! Idziemy!
How'd you do that?! It went right past me!
But there are holes in your defense!\nI'm not giving up!
Looks like <avatar_name> is\nstruggling to keep up with Jun.\nGuess that's to be expected.
But am I imagining it, or is he\nactually starting to close in on Jun?
Łoł! It's already gotten late!
Captain! You have to get\ngoing to the hospital!
Got it!
All right, <avatar_name>! This'll be\nthe last round! Give me all you got!
Man! He's so quick!
(He's got a fighting spirit,\nand he's so persistent!)
Is he... beating Jun?
It's not over yet! No free shots!
Haaah!
Jun!
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
Nice shot!
(He stuck it out all the way.\nHe never surrendered the ball! And he's got\nthe stamina to fight hard the whole way.)
(He's the player I'm looking for!)
To be honest, <avatar_name>,\nthere's a tournament coming up soon,\nand we need some talent to fill out our ranks.
You've convinced me of your skill.
You could lead the players of the\nMusashi team while I'm on the sidelines.
Huh? What's the first-year\nfrom yesterday doing with Misugi?
They stayed out pretty late.\nWhat were they getting up to?
Hey, you all made it!
Starting today, <avatar_name>\nis going to be my practice partner.
Huh?
I'm going to give him special training,\nand in the Junior Hero League, he's going to\nlead the team when I'm not on the field!
But he's just a first-year...\nAre you serious, Misugi?
You might be green, but you showed a great\nhustle yesterday, <avatar_name>.
Well, if Misugi is going to all this trouble,\nthere must be something special about him.
Plus, since we won't be around after graduation,\nit's important to train the freshmen now.
Just because I'm taking him under my wing\ndoesn't mean he's getting a free ride!
You're the boss.\nDo what you think is best, Misugi!
You're one of us now, <avatar_name>!
One-on-one time with Misugi is gonna be tough!\nYou better be up to it, <avatar_name>!
I'll do my best to fight for the team!
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous.
I'll do my best!
I'm more than ready!
Well said!
Always remember that passion!
Think you can handle it?
Keep that same intensity you\nshowed yesterday, <avatar_name>!
Rock and roll!
I've got high hopes for you!
Well, I can't fault your enthusiasm.\nYou're just the kind of person Musashi needs.
Everyone's expecting a lot from you,\nbut I don't think you'll disappoint!
Okay, that's all I had to say. Now let's practice!
Remember, we're on our way to the Junior Hero\nLeague! Let's battle to the final whistle!
Yes, Captain!
Junior Hero League: First Day
Here we go! It's time for the opener\nof the Junior Hero League! Everyone ready?
With how much I've been practicing,\nnothing scares me!
Doesn't matter if it's Toho or Nankatsu!\nWe'll take 'em all down!
Remember: If you could do it in practice,\nyou can do it here! Heh, wish I coulda\npracticed as much as you guys.
This time will be different! It's a whole\nnew Musashi MS! We're not just a team\nthat defends until Misugi swaps in anymore!
I'm trusting you to be our secret weapon,\n<avatar_name>!
The game will really be decided when\nyou come in, Misugi.
I'm pretty nervous, actually...
The team can still depend on you, right?
Ha! C'mon, don't talk like that!
Of course the team can depend on me,\nbut don't get too overreliant on me.
I've seen your talents on the field,\n<avatar_name>! Don't be afraid!\nLet's go in with our heads held high!
You're actually nervous? That's kinda surprising.
Show no mercy on the field! Give 'em all you got!
I always get nervous, too, <avatar_name>.\nIt's normal. You'll do fine!
Your nerves will vanish once you get on the field!
And as always, I'll come in\nduring the second half.
Play until you're too tired to move!\nThen Misugi will take over!
What are you talking about? Aren't you and\n<avatar_name> going to join me in\nthe second half?
Tak!
Well in that case, <avatar_name>...
You'd better have enough energy for two men,\n'cause you'll be on the field the whole time!
We've been training like crazy for this day!\nNow it's time to show off how strong we've gotten!
Musashi MS is new and improved!\nSay it loud and proud!
Musashi MS is new and improved!
The opening ceremony for the Junior Hero League\nsponsored by the Soccer Association will commence\nshortly.
Starting just this month, the best teams from\nNationals and even various Regionals have\ngathered. But this is no mere exhibition.
The known goal of these games is that they will\ndetermine the players for the international\ntournament in America next month!
While the top schools facing off is one thing,\nindividual play will also be important. The top\nplayers are competing to represent our nation!
Who from among these teams will be chosen to\nstand as heroes representing all of Japan?
And here come the players now!
We made it in time... somehow.
I'm impressed you were able to\norganize this on such short notice.
You and me both.
It was only possible thanks to all the\nparticipating schools being so understanding.
I still can't believe the French International\nwas canceled and replaced with the\nJunior Youth World Challenge.
And there's also the inclusion of even more\nridiculously skilled teams from over the world...
The training camp... The European tour... All\nthose carefully laid plans just went up in smoke.
Yeah.
Every match is an opportunity\nfor a player to grow.
Exactly. That's why this\nJunior Hero League is so important.
Knowing that this isn't just an exhibition, but\nthat we're selecting players to represent Japan,\nshould inspire everyone to do their best.
Hopefully, the players can build on the potential\nthey showed at Nationals.
The Junior Hero League is a chance for us\nto see their growth in action.
That's another benefit to this.
We will have aided them in developing the kind of\nskill it takes to compete on the world stage.
Indeed. We've done our part.\nNow, we just have to believe in them.
Keep up the pressure on defense\nuntil Misugi can swap in!
We're really cutting it close...\nShould I give the signal early?
On a good cross all I want is for the ball\nto stay low and travel really fast!
I know! But all the opponents are really tall!
If we need the ball to fly high, I'm your man!\nWe won't lose when I'm on forward!
Everyone is planning all on their own...\nI'm glad they can play without me.
How are you holding up, <avatar_name>?\nStill nervous after you've had\na taste of your first game?
Nervous? Don't even know the word!
Actually, I'm getting pretty tired...
A little, but everyone is supporting me!
Ha! You're reliable, all right!\nThe players who can turn their nerves into power\nare the strongest!
Show everyone what you can do! Impress the team,\nfrighten our opponents, and wow the audience!
You feeling okay? You're not gonna\nfall asleep out there, are you?
That'd be a new one! A player having a nap\nmid-game! Heh. But it's only natural to feel\ntired. Just don't let your concentration slip!
I'm glad the team is treating you well.\nFitting in with everyone is most important!
When you're in trouble out there, all you have to\ndo is look around you! Everyone on the team is\nsomeone you can count on!
They're always there for you if you start\ngetting too nervous!
Yo, Misugi! Good to see you in uniform again.
I saw you in the finals of the Tokyo tournament.\nYou okay, man?
Sorry to have worried you. I'm perfectly fine.
They haven't announced the names of the\nstarting line-up yet? It's just like the\nTokyo tournament...
Will Misugi come on the field at\nthe turning point for this match?
Heh, probably. He's a one-man team for Musashi.
Oh, shut up. That's not true!\nIn fact, we're about to take a big lead!\nIt'll be Musashi MS that decides the game!
I'm confident, of course,\nbut this could still go either way.
Yeah, we can't get too full of\nourselves. We can't know who'll\nwin until the game actually starts!
You look like a first-year.
Then again, younger players can still be good.\nWe've sure learned that in the past.
So don't expect us to use kid gloves.
I was hoping you'd say something like that!\nThe gloves are off for me, too!
You know, it's gonna be super embarrassing\nwhen a first-year kicks your butt!
Don't expect me to hold back, either!
Heh, you sure it's a good idea\nto goad me like that?
Meiwa Higashi doesn't play nice on the field.\nWhen we sense weakness, we strike.\nI hope you're ready for that!
Cocky little brat, aren't ya?
I don't care how old you are!\nPrepare to be crushed!
That's how Meiwa Higashi rolls!
Well, there's nothing wrong\nwith a little confidence...
But Meiwa Higashi is about to\nsmash that confidence to pieces!
Now listen closely, <avatar_name>.
This league tournament is going to\nhave all the best teams from Nationals.\nWe'll be seeing the highest level of play.
If you can snag people's attention here, a number\nof other players are going to take notice, too.
Which means you can meet some players\nfrom overseas and learn from them.
If you can find good rivals who can push you to\nbe better, it'll mean a lot for your growth as a\nplayer.
No time to waste!
Listen, <avatar_name>.
The league tournament is going to be the cream of\nthe crop. They're bringing in all the best teams\nfrom Nationals.
If you can snag people's attention here, a number\nof other players are going to take notice, too.
Which means you can meet some players from\noverseas and learn from them.
If you can find good rivals who can push you to\nbe better, it'll mean a lot for your growth as a\nplayer.
Time to get out there!
You gotta be kidding!
Jeez, I expected you Musashi kids to play like\nyou did at the Tokyo finals, but you did\nso much better than that!
Of course we did! We've been training for this!
But you guys have clearly been practicing, too!\nYou were even stronger than you were at Nationals!\nWe only won by the skin of our teeth!
Guess you aren't all talk, huh, Honma?
And we've still got so much further to go!\nWe'll keep getting better!
Yeah, but it's plain as day that you're really\nenjoying it out there. When you were losing, did\nthat inspire you to come up with a new plan?
Toho has Hyuga, Nankatsu has Tsubasa,\nand now Musashi can put up a good fight!
You got a win today, now get out there and\nwin the whole tournament!
You know it! We always give it our all!
(That first-year who was on defense...\nI've never met someone who can tackle that hard!)
(He would even fit in on Meiwa's Sliding Squad!)
(He's definitely not your average player!)
(He could dodge so easily, even while\nhe was dribbling the ball! He's good.\nHe might even be better than Takeshi!)
(I didn't think it was possible for a first-year\nto measure up to Takeshi. Looks like a\nchallenger to the throne has arrived!)
(In Junior High next year, Takeshi and\nthese guys will be in the spotlight.)
You're Jun Misugi, right?
Oh, you guys are Ishida and Takei!\nYou're the heart of Minamiuwa's team!
Tsubasa Ozora and Jun Misugi...\nHeh, two geniuses headed for a showdown!
Isn't this your first big tournament?\nAren't you scared?
Just the opposite! I'm completely thrilled!\nIt's not every day that you get a chance to\nplay against opponents of this caliber!
So let's have the best game we can!
Heh. We'll wipe that smile off your face!
You put a first-year in your starting line-up?\nGuess your team's stretched a little thin.
You sure you can handle it out there?
Shut up!
Age doesn't matter in soccer!
It's nice to meet you, sir.
Heh! The new kid's got such a temper.\nBut I always say the angry ones\nare trying to mask a lack of confidence!
I think it's time someone taught you how\nreal soccer is played.
So you think you can keep up with us, junior?
We'll see how long that confidence lasts.
Oh. Uh... Wow.
You actually have manners. Wasn't expecting that.\nYeah, it's nice to meet you, too!
Takei...
Fine, whatever. Time for you to learn\na lesson from your elders.
I don't get it... The genius Jun Misugi\nhas teamed up with this rookie?
When you swapped in, Misugi, the whole course of\nthe game changed. What if you were able to\nplay like that the whole match?
If only. I can only devote my energy\nto playing for a short time.
I had to learn how to pace myself.\nI can't even run for too long.
Oh, now I get it! The kid here is your\nsubstitute. But a prodigy like you, relying\nso much on him? He must really be somethin'.
Aha! But until Misugi swaps in, you're just...
...Hey!
Drop it, Takei. We lost.\nThere's nothing else to be said.
Okay, I guess...
But I'll get my revenge against\nyou next time! Be ready, Misugi!
Heh. I'm looking forward to it!
I'm sorry, Ishida. I was being\na sore loser... I didn't mean it.
I know. I'm sure they understand that, too.
So when we play against them next time,\nshow them how much stronger you are!
Wait. You actually look... happy?
I have a team to rely on, just like Misugi.\nThe stronger opponents we have, the better!
(To be honest, I'm shocked. Never\nthought I'd be outplayed by a first-year.)
(This summer, the competition is really gonna\nbe tough. I'm just now realizing that...)
(But I won't let these regrets pull me down!\nI'll use them as fuel to push me toward\nbecoming the best soccer player in Japan!)
You had some superb headers out there.\nReminds me of Takei in our first year.
(<avatar_name>...\nHe has the potential to become a great forward!)
I'm counting on you, <avatar_name>!
Hey, don't get too reliant on him.\nHe's still sloppy when crossing.
You can trap the ball so easily,\njust like Misugi...
Hey, get moving, <avatar_name>!
Easy, Sanada! Don't get too wild!
That dribble...! Where was Sanada's head?
Oh, that's just jealousy talking!
<avatar_name>, you were on\nfire out there! How're you feeling?
You did wonderfully, <avatar_name>.\nYou improved so quickly, I could hardly\nbelieve you were the same person!
We've still got a long ways to go!
I'm just worried about Misugi.\nAre you feeling okay?
I only did well because we practiced so\nhard!
Heh, that's true. It's good to stay focused on\nimproving. You can always get better!
We won't lose!
Ah! Back to practice already?
The next one won't be as easy!
<avatar_name>'s improvement is spurring the\nrest of us on. We can get even better!
What? Look at him, he's fine! Unless...\nYou weren't just putting up a tough front,\nwere you, Misugi?
Hey, good point.\nYou've got a big hurdle to overcome, Misugi.
Well... If that's what you're taking motivation\nfrom, <avatar_name>, I can't complain.
But don't worry about me.\nI can do anything I set my mind to!
Yeah, it's a good way to drill out bad habits.
Our teamwork is getting better.\nIt's a lot easier to communicate now.
But on the flip-side, our opponents barely\nknow anything about <avatar_name>.
All the better! He's our secret weapon!
You're ready, <avatar_name>! You can lead the\nplayers of Musashi MS while I'm not in the game!
That's what I've wanted this whole time.
Captain! Everyone!
The captain's father sent along some\ncold sports drinks. Let's all take a breather.
Dad...
All right, good idea. Let's take five.
Props to Mr. Misugi! Man, I could\ndrink that whole thing in one go!
Me too!
Oh man... There's nothing better than\na cold drink after a long workout!
Ahhh! I feel alive again!
*pant*
Hey, you okay, Misugi?
Yeah, just worn out. I've been\npracticing since sunrise.
But even with all that, I'm still not\nback to being as good as I was before...
Misugi... You don't have to worry about that.
If that's all you want, why don't you\nget out and practice more?
Yeah. Our next match is against a pretty tough\nschool. If you can improve your condition any\nbefore then, all the better.
Heh, I appreciate your concern, but I'll be fine.
Besides, I want to know how well I can play\neven when I'm tired. Practice is the best way\nto find out!
Well... If you say so, Misugi.
Just don't overdo it, man.
Be the best you can be, Captain!
We'll all pull our weight!
You said it, <avatar_name>!
You know it! We always give it our all!
All right! Let's help Misugi find out what\nhis limits are! More practice, everybody!
If we all do our best, we can take some of\nthe load off Misugi!
I'm counting on you, <avatar_name>!
Everyone on the team looks out\nfor each other, huh?
Yeah. We're lucky to have each other.
(Everyone is working so hard...)
(And the matches will only keep getting harder...\nI hope my heart can hold up.)
(But no matter how sick I get,\nI can't let it stand in the way of my dreams!)
If I remember right, in the finals at Shizuoka,\nOtomo lost to Nankatsu.
Otomo is strong even in Shizuoka, where\nsoccer is serious business. Stay alert.
Ha! "Stay alert"!
Is that your whole strategy?\nSounds like you think you already got us beat.
It's...!
Shun Nitta! You're the striker for Otomo, right?
Yup. And I know you, too. You're Jun Misugi.\nIt's an honor to finally meet.
Likewise. I heard from Tsubasa how fast you are,\nand what a fierce weapon your Falcon Shot is.\nAnd you're only a second-year!
Tsubasa told us all about you!
Today's game is really gonna be somethin'!\nMisugi and Nitta squaring off! Ace against ace!
I'm game. I've been waiting for this!
You're no match for me! There's no way I'll lose!
But our team is more than just Nitta!\nYou're no match for the Otomo Quartet, Misugi!\nYou won't be able to do anything against us!
What'd you say?!
As long as we can keep Misugi shut down, we win!\nYou'll have nothing left but regret\nafter the game is over!
Hehehe...
Shut up, man! Lemme tell you something...!
It's okay, Ichinose. Don't worry.\nOur top trio will shut them up.
Tak! I'll show you that you should've\nbeen keeping an eye on me instead!
Yeah, what he said!
Pretty cocky for a team with a first-year\nin their starting lineup.
But don't expect us to take it easy on ya\njust 'cause you're a kid.
That's for sure! You better watch your back\nwhen you've got the ball.
Cause the Otomo Quartet is gonna steal it\nso fast your head will spin!
Four of you? Sounds fun.
Then... I'll just make an escape!
I can handle you four loudmouths!
Well, you certainly have some spirit.
It's gonna be fun tearing you apart!
Ha! Coward!
But no matter how far you run, you can't escape\nthe great Shun Nitta! Never forget that!
Hey, get it right! It's the Otomo Quartet!
Cool it, Cap! This guy's\njust trying to rile you up!
Oh, I get it. You're trying to get me mad,\nso I don't think straight on the field.
You've got a mouth on you, alright.\nYou almost tripped me up, first-year!
You're joking! Only Nankatsu\nis a worthy opponent for me.
I hate to say it, but not even the\nOtomo Quartet could stop you, Misugi...
I mean, by the time I got out,\nyou guys had really worn everyone down.
The Otomo Quartet wasn't\neasy to beat, that's for sure.
You were right, though. Your trio\nhad some pretty fancy moves.
You guys should call yourselves\nthe Musashi Tridente!
Tridente... what, like a trident?\nHey, that doesn't sound bad!
This was the first time since elementary school\nthat we were able to play against each other,\nMisugi. You didn't disappoint.
Good luck in your next match!
Thank you. Much appreciated.
Jeez, Nitta... The guy's a genius to\nrival Tsubasa, ain't he? What'd\nyou make of him after the match?
We couldn't beat him now, but... One day I'll get\nstrong enough to win this tournament! No doubt!
If any of us can, it's you.
(Nitta's really getting fired up...\nOtomo is in good hands with him around.)
(<avatar_name>... Who even was that guy?)
(The way he was able to bob and weave while\ndribbling... It was just like Tsubasa!)
(Next year's Nationals... I thought Otomo had\nit in the bag as long as they had Nitta,\nbut it's not gonna be that easy...)
(To be honest, I'm shocked. Never thought\nI'd be outplayed by a first-year.)
(But there's no way I'll lose next time!\nNext year is a whole new game!)
(I'll see you next year at Nationals,\n<avatar_name>! Don't you dare\nquit between now and then!)
All right, guys! Let's tear up the field today!
We've been playing together since\nelementary school, haven't we? The\ntwo of us pull off the best combos.
Ahahaha! You're deluded if you think\nYOU'RE the perfect duo!
If this is how they psych themselves up before\na match, this one's already in the bag, dude!
What'd you say?!
Whoa, I'm seeing double!
Oh no, not you two again...
The Tachibana Twins, from Hanawa...\nRenowned as the best pair of players in\nmiddle school soccer.
We've been playing soccer together\nsince we could walk!
Today, you have the honor of witnessing\nthe best combination play in Japan!
We're not gonna lose! So what if there are\ntwo of you? We've got a trio!
Not just the starters! At Musashi MS,\neven players on the bench are fighting!
If you only focus on pairs of two,\nyou'll just get double vision.
Doesn't matter if you have three starters or\nthree hundred! We won't stop!
That's right! No one can beat\nour Skylab techniques!
You two better stay sharp. You pay so much\nattention to jumping around that you don't\nrealize when your weak spots are exposed!
Idziemy! We can overwhelm 'em\non the field, Musashi MS!
You said it, Captain!
It doesn't matter how good of a player YOU are,\nsoccer's all about combination plays!
Nobody in Japan can keep up with our\nco-op combo! We're unstoppable!
I'm not going to lose to some gimmick.
I can take you two on by myself!
So... Who's who again?
Oh? You think you can take on the twins?
I like you. This'll be fun!
Oh, is that so?
Then let's see what you've got!
That's... Is this really the time for that?
Are you trying to be funny? I mean,\nwe're twins, so we look the same, but...
A-Anyway, just remember\nthe numbers on our jerseys!
We got sucked into his pace.
Shoot! We couldn't win...
We were trying to work our duo magic...!
Your moves as a duo were something else.\nIt wouldn't've been surprising if the match\nhad gone the other way.
Doesn't jumping around like that put a lot of\nstrain on your legs? Can you really keep that up?
I'd like to say we can handle it fine, but we\nprobably bit off more than we could chew.
Yeah, we were worried about\nconserving our energy, and that\nalso kept us from playing our best.
Speaking of worrying, how are you, Misugi?\nFeelin' any better?
Hey, don't worry about me. Did I look uneasy?
Nah, man, you played great! It was cool to have\na match against Japan's future representative!
Ah! Well... I'm doing my best to make that happen.
You know, those guys from Musashi\nhad a solid duo, after all.
Yeah, they did.
That's Misugi for ya. He joined\nand Musashi became a whole new team.
Hmm. Our combination play is still important,\nbut maybe we should find players that can\nimprove the team as a whole.
Musashi and Nankatsu have a lot of players like\nthat. Maybe that's the difference between us...
And can you believe that first-year? He could\npass so well... We got torn apart by his skill!
Yeah... Even with Hanawa's tough defenses, he\ncould pass the ball through like it was nothing.
He tore our plan apart. We should've led\nHanawa MS so differently...
No way! There's no way we could've known\nthere was a guy that would shred our defenses\nlike that. It was a total shock! Like an ambush!
Yeah... That dude could totally rep Japan\nwith defense like that.
It blew me away to see that\nfrom a first-year! Good grief...
Good work out there, everyone.
I'm warning you! I'm gonna start pushing everyone\nreally hard from here on out. Trust me and\nfollow my lead. Thanks, everyone.
The Junior Hero League is just\ngetting started. Get some rest.
That's what I was about to say!
Couldn't agree more. Rest is super important!\nBut you'll take your own advice, right, Misugi?
I will. I'm going home and taking a long nap.
Thanks for everything, Misugi!
Huh...?
No one has gone home?
We're...
My parents are coming later so I have more\ntime to practice. Heading home early would\njust be lame.
All right, until tomorrow then.
Keep pushing yourselves, everyone!\nRemember, pain is weakness leaving the body!
10 minutes later...
For crying out loud! No more, man! Have mercy!
There's no turning back now! Keep going!
Okay, everyone! Cleats on,\nand let's bring up the lights!
It's time for the second half of practice!
Have you guys already worn yourselves out?\nC'mon, you won't do well in the game\nif that's all you can handle!
Hey, Ichinose! Your\ndribbling is getting all weird!
*wheeze* I know. I'm gettin' tired...\nBut I can keep going!
Yo, Sanada! The timing of your shots is off!\nThe ball's gonna go right over the goal!
*pant* Yeah, I'm getting sloppy...
No surrender! C'mon, come at me again!
Sorry, <avatar_name>.\nHave you ever practiced for this long before?
I just want to get better!
Why didn't we tell Misugi?
My parents want me to study more.
Good answer, bro! The rest of us feel the same.
Yeah, don't hold back! Next game, follow my lead!
Wait! Let me practice with you too,\n<avatar_name>!
It happened so suddenly, but before I knew it,\nthe team started to revolve around\n<avatar_name>...
I wish Misugi could see this...
You know Misugi.\nHe'd just say "I'll practice with you guys."
If he knew about these extra practices, he'd just\npush himself 'til he was exhausted. He'd never\nrest. That's why you have to keep it secret.
Besides, isn't secret training so much cooler?
I get that. Sometimes I wonder if I\nshould spend more time on classwork.
Really? My parents aren't like that.
Look, <avatar_name>,\ndon't worry about your grades.
Tak! Misugi told me everything\nis being taken care of.
Misugi is scarily good at studying\nand teaching. Dude's brilliant.
A soccer genius and a school genius. Sheesh...
Now that I think about it,\nMisugi really is an extraordinary person...
Okay, everybody! Take five before\nthe next phase of practice!
Whew... Can do!
Just... get me some water...
Why do you practice so hard, Honma?
Is all this practice really necessary?
Why...?
Duh! This is our big shot! We can't screw it up.
Look, <avatar_name>...\nYou know... about Misugi's heart.
Misugi loves soccer more than anything,\nand he's really good at it,\nbut he was born with a handicap.
That's why I attended this middle school. He\nloves soccer, but he's barely been able to play\nit. I wanted to help him hold off his illness.
Misugi is desperate for a cure. He was betting\non being well enough to play this year...
He wants to rematch all the players he faced in\nelementary school. Especially Tsubasa Ozora.
To accomplished that dream,\nhe even put his health at great risk during\nthe Tokyo finals earlier this year.
Even then... We couldn't\ndefeat Hyuga or Wakashimazu.
We weren't good enough... Musashi lost to Toho.\nWe never even made it to Nationals...
Misugi is fighting for his life... And that's\none fight we're powerless to help with...
He always just says, "Don't worry!"\nI laugh along with him, but...
We were in elementary school with Misugi.\nWe've known him for a long time.\nSo the losses hit that much harder...
Yeah, the last one really got to me.
But the Junior Hero League is a whole new chance!\nMisugi's dream could still come true!
Hey, it's more than just one dream, now.
First, we need to beat Nankatsu.\nWe'll rematch Tsubasa Ozora and win.
Second, we'll represent Japan\nin an International Tournament.
Actually, the Soccer Association and Misugi...\nWell, it's not my place to really jabber about it!\nThat's his business.
Ever since elementary school, Misugi has been\nthere for us. He's always there if you need\nsupport, and he practically carries all of us...
So this is it! It's time we help Misugi\nfor a change, and made his dream come true!
And regain our honor, too!\nI'm still haunted by that final game in Tokyo...
<avatar_name>... I know it'll be hard,\nbut you'll help us, right?
Tak! With <avatar_name> helping us,\nI'm sure we can pull it off!
Of course!
I'll lead Musashi to victory!
D-Do you think I can really do it?
Tak! Let's finish this together!
That's the spirit!
Well, we're askin' a lot from a first-year...
But you're a good player, through and through!\nWe need you if we're gonna beat the other schools!
Misugi himself brought you under his wing,\n<avatar_name>. You have the most potential\nout of all of us!
I've seen your talents on the field,\n<avatar_name>! Don't be afraid!\nLet's go in with our heads held high!
C'mon, let's get back to practicing!\nWe'll all get better and surprise Misugi\nwith how much we've improved!
Tak!
Hey, Young Noble of the Field!
Ugh, that nickname is so embarrassing...
Aw, c'mon! Nicknames are cool! Especially yours!\nGet it? Because that's how you play on the field?\nLike a noble! And you're young. So... Young Noble!
Oh, you're so very clever... Ace Killer, Soda.
See, you do like nicknames!\nYou even got mine right.
Today, I'm not ashamed of the name "Ace Killer."\nI'll show you how good I am on the field, and Team\nMusashi's aces will know how I earned that name!
No, I... I get it. It's pretty self-explanatory.\nAnyway, I've been looking forward to this!\nEven if you do win, we won't make it easy!
Okay then! Let's put that idea to the test!
You might look like a first year...\nBut you can't fool me.
I'd bet my life that they\nbrought you in as a ringer.
You're about to learn how accurate\nthe title Ace Killer is!
Not if I get you first!
Uhhh... I'm not an ace!
Let's just have a good game.
Oh, everyone says that.\nYou've got no creativity, kiddo.
But I've yet to actually see it happen.
What, you think if you act like such a coward,\nI won't come after you on the field?\nThink again, junior!
The thing I loathe most of all... is a coward!
They'll hafta carry you off this field.
Aww, look at the innocent widdle baby!\nOnce we hit the pitch, you're gonna\nlearn what a real match is like.
A kind heart won't save you out there!
You were a sight to behold out there.\nYou really are the Young Noble of the Field...
Right back at ya. You definitely\nlived up to your nickname, too.
You just kept coming, and you could tackle\nso hard! I felt hounded.
Heh. I'm glad I was able to\nshow off my unique style of play!
By the way, Misugi, are you feelin' okay?\nYou looked like you were in pain\nduring that last part of the match.
Oh, I'm fine! Anyone would be sore\nif YOU were playing against them!
Aw, thanks, bro! It's like I always say:\ndefeat the ace and the whole team falls!\nThat's why I'm the Ace Killer!
Well... I guess that's all she wrote. You're\nstill undefeated, right? Then go for the gold!
Hey, Misugi... Are you actually okay?\nYou're sweating an awful lot...
I'll be fine. Besides, we're only halfway through.
I dunno about that... I mean, I think\nyou're working the hardest out there.
Not any more than the rest of you. But I might\nbe flagging a bit. I'm sorry, you guys.
No one is thinking that, Misugi.
Well, the game's over. Let's head out!
Y-You got it!
(Man, Azumaichi just couldn't avoid that kid\non defense. That first-year could dribble\njust like Tsubasa...)
(Was he just a first-year? He was a beast...)
(His tackle was so strong! And he had such reach!)
(I'm not sure there's anyone who can tackle\nlike that... Besides me, of course!)
(Looks like I've got some competition\nin my quest to be a national representative!)
Jun Misugi, you're that noble guy...\nBeen meanin' to have a word with ya.
That'd be me. And you're Hiroshi Jito,\nthe guy that put so much pressure on Tsubasa.
I heard 'bout your heart condition. But don't\nexpect any mercy out there. Prepare yourself!
I wouldn't want it any other way!\nI won't cut you any slack, either!
Hey, I love that confidence! But I'd be surprised\nif it's enough to break Jito's strength!
Soccer isn't about raw strength!\nWe'll show you that with our combos!
Heh... Think that all ya like,\nbut I'm about ta teach ya a valuable lesson.
And after the match, I'll be lookin' forward\nto you sobbin' all the way home!
Heh heh...
Misugi...
It's just like Ichinose said, soccer isn't about\nraw strength, and Musashi MS will show them that.
Let's keep going, you guys!
Hear, hear!
Been hearing plenty of rumors about you.
I got a good instinct for people.\nComes from fightin'. I got a feelin' there's\nsomethin' special 'bout you.
But I'll crush ya with my raw power!\nGet ready to lose!
You're the one who's gonna be crushed!
That won't work on me.
What do you eat to grow that big...?
Just like a yappy lil dog.
Perhaps my gut was wrong 'bout you.
Oh-ho! Guess ya can't be goaded into a\none-on-one fight. You're smarter than ya look.
Now ya made me hungry.
Wait, what were we talkin' about?
Well... Uhhh... I just eat whatever, really.\nI got this big just by... growin' up.
Weird thing to ask about before the game.\nYou're a strange dude, dude.
What?! How could I lose at a game\nof strength like soccer?!
It's not like that, Jito. You called\nsoccer "a game of strength", but\nit's not even about strength, really.
It's about how you USE that strength! It's about\ntechnique and skill! But if nothing else,\nI can't fault your dauntless fighting spirit.
Misugi...
Yeah, you made yer point... I mean, strength\nsure didn't help me win, did it?
Now that I have a chance to ask...\nMisugi, is it true that you're ill?
You were lookin' kinda pale\nin the second half, there.
An' you were getting pretty shaky, too.\nHad me worried. Ya gonna be okay?
Thanks for worrying about me, guys. But it's not\nreally something I can do anything about. My body\nmight be sick, but my spirit isn't! I'm still me!
Well, if you say so...
But the show must go on!\nGo on and win the whole tournament!
Tak! Then I can say I've played against\nJapan's representative!
Hey, Misugi... Are you actually okay?\nYou're sweating an awful lot...
What are you saying, Sanada?\nWe've only played half the game. I'm not tired.
Yeah, but you haven't given yourself\nany time to rest. You've just been going\nfull speed ahead this whole time.
Hasn't everyone been doing that?
Well, yeah, but... It's not as hard\non us as it is on you, Misugi...
If you guys can do it, so can I!\nNow let's keep going!
Y-You got it!
(Ya made up for your age in skill.\nYa beat me man to man.)
(With that kid's skill, it'd be no surprise\nif he was made a representative...)
(Fightin' against world champion players\nside by side... That'd be somethin' fer sure!)
(But I musta really gotten rusty since\nNationals if that first-year was so tough...)
(Still, they won, fair and square.\nI didn't realize how good the kid was...)
(If that kid's better than Sano, after Hirado\nconquers Nationals next year, I'll send him to\nSano to make an all new Hirado duo!)
Over here, <avatar_name>! I'm open!
Nice pass!
Here we go!
H-Huh...?!
Aaah...
Sorry about that, <avatar_name>...\nYou gave me a perfect pass, and I wasted it!\nIt was totally my fault! Sorry, buddy.
H-Hey, even Michelangelo made some\nbad paintings! Nobody's perfect, man.
Wait, Michelangelo made paintings?\nI must've missed that episode...
Not the cartoon character, you moron!\nThe Renaissance artist!
Point is, anyone can make a mistake.\nMisugi's just human, like all of us.
Oh! It's already gotten late!
Practice is over for today, everybody.
I'll clean up the field, Misugi. You go on ahead.
No can do. I should help clean up...
No, no, really, I'm good! Listen... Don't you\nhave your examination at the hospital today?
Yeah, but... It always takes forever,\nand it's so irritating...
Hey, did you hear that? That must be your\nparents' car, Misugi! You should get going!
Oh, okay... See you guys soon.
(We're only halfway through the Junior Hero\nLeague, and I already feel so weak...)
(Playing against our opponents...\nIt's so draining on my stupid, weak body...)
(But I can't stop. I won't stop.\nI have a dream I have to realize!)
(And if I want to make it come true, I...!)
Did you see him try to make that shot?
Yeah. Misugi would never miss a shot\nthat easy in a million years.
He's obviously exhausted.
I wish I could help him more...\nMisugi is carrying such a terrible burden...
Our opponents in the Junior Hero League will\nonly get stronger. But if we rely on Misugi now,\nit would only risk his health even more...
But if we don't have Misugi\nduring the game this time...
Well, we've been a team since elementary school.\nMaybe nothing's changed. We don't know.
But when a match gets tough,\nwe've always had Misugi to fall back on.
Yeah, guess we have... Sorry.
Hey, I've been helping, too!
If I could just keep improving...
Just hang on, you guys! Don't give up!
Yeah, you totally have. But you shouldn't\nhave to. You're just a first-year.\nThis is our burden to bear, not yours.
You've been giving it your all.\nThe real failures are us third-years...
Yeah... Even if we all work together,\nwe're still not able to ease Misugi's load...
No, <avatar_name>! That's not what we meant!\nYou've been improving amazingly fast!
Yeah. The real problem is us not improving.
And if we want to, the only way\nis with more practice!
But we need to do more than just not give up!\nWe need a way to take the pressure off Misugi!
All I can do is watch in silence as he exhausts\nhimself... I feel so ashamed.
I'm sorry... If only I was more skilled...!
Snap out of it, guys! What are we even doing?!
I just want Misugi to be able to play\nwithout hurting himself!
But we're just standing here whining\nabout it, being all pathetic!
Use your anger to drive you!
We need to grow together!
Listen to <avatar_name>!
Take that anger, and put all of it into kicking\nthe ball! Little by little, we'll get better!
Listen to <avatar_name>!
It's time we stop playing soccer by relying\non Misugi the whole time! We've been playing that\nway since we were in elementary school!
Yeah... Tak!
Misugi would want us to grow, too!
We have to pay back all the trust he's put in us!
<avatar_name>, I've just been timid and weak.
But together, we can help Misugi! We can\nsupport him, like he's always supported us!
Tak!
Alright, now let's get back to practice!
Turn the stadium lights on!\nWe'll use the field for as long as we can!
We've got a special training\nprogram today, <avatar_name>.
We'll be doing a series of one-on-one match ups.
Let's see just how good you've gotten!
Alright, that's good!
Not bad at all, <avatar_name>.\nI'm impressed with how much you've improved.
I'm expecting great things\nfrom you come game time.
I'm not calling you a slouch, <avatar_name>,\nbut I know you can do better than that.
Bigger, faster, stronger! We hafta work hard. You\nwant the team to be able to rely on you right?
Okay, we'll take a little break\nand then it's back to training!
We've got a special training\nprogram today, <avatar_name>.
We'll be doing a series of one-on-one match ups.
Let's see just how good you've gotten!
That's enough!
Not bad at all, <avatar_name>.\nI'm impressed with how much you've improved.
I'm expecting great things from you come game\ntime.
I'm not calling you a slouch, <avatar_name>,\nbut I know you can do better than that.
Bigger, faster, stronger! We hafta work hard. You\nwant the team to be able to rely on you right?
Okay, we'll take a breather, but then it's back to\ntraining!
Yo, Misugi! Long time no see!
Matsuyama!
Yeah, haven't seen you since we caught\nthat game together at Nationals.
Back then, I thought for sure we were gonna\nface-off. Guess life's funny like that.
Yeah. I thought the same.
We're in the middle of training for the league!\nWe've been working harder and harder\non our teamwork!
Today will be the test of that teamwork!\nWe'll defeat the genius Misugi of Musashi MS!\nYou'd better be ready!
Heh. I'm not the one who'll lose, Matsuyama.
Both of us will need all our strength to defeat\nthe other. This'll be one for the history books!
We're facing off against\nMatsuyama, eh? I can't wait!
Listen. Matsuyama is one of the best players in\nJapan, and Furano is known across the country\nfor their teamwork. We're in for a tough match.
We've got them beat there, at least.\nNo one can top our sense of teamwork!
And Matsuyama can't compare to you,\nMisugi! We'll come out the winners!
Tak! Let's kick off the second half of the\nJunior Hero League with a strong victory!
Heck yeah!
You gotta be kidding!
My team sure hasn't been slacking, but even with\nall our practicin', you had us dead to rights.\nYou're amazing, Misugi...
...
Misugi?
...Huh? Oh, sorry. I was just lost in thought.
You okay, man? During the last part of the game,\nyou really seemed out of it.
Look, I get it. These league matches require\nhigh-level play. It'd wear anybody out. But with\nyour condition... Like, do I have to say it?
Heh... You're very kind. I'm touched\nby your concern, but I'm fine.
You guys had enviable teamwork and determination.\nI just wanted to feel like that again...
That's why I'm tired. That's all.
Heh... Okay, dude. Whatever you say.
I'll be cheerin' for ya, Misugi.\nGive it your all in the rest of the league games!
Ah... Matsuyama, the next time\nyou see me, I'll be representing\nJapan on the international stage!
Oh! Well, uh... Good luck!
Agh...!
Hey, Misugi, you alright? You're burning up...
I'm fine... I'm perfectly fine.
(Two more games... Just two more games...\nI can't bow out now!)
(If I do, my dream...)
(Playing against Tsubasa with a perfect winning\nstreak... And wearing the uniform of a Japan\nrep... They'll all be for nothing!)
Ugh...!
Misugi!
Misugi collapsed in the stadium locker room,\nand was rushed to the hospital...
Aoba... How's Misugi? What's his condition?
Jun's... Ah, Captain Misugi's heart is very weak.\nThe doctor said it's because of fatigue.
That's what I was afraid of...
But they said that if he stays in the hospital\nfor a bit to recover his strength, he might still\nbe able to play in the final game of the league.
Really? Finally, some good news!
But that means he'll be hospitalized for\nthe entire next game. We won't be able to\nrely on his skill.
And the next match is against Toho Academy...
...
There's nothing more we can do.\nLet's head back to school.
If we stay here at the hospital,\nwe'll just be a bother.
Yeah... You're right. We should go.
You've got a point... I mean, we have our answers\nabout Misugi. Now, we'd just be a nuisance.
Well, okay... Aoba, take care of our boy, y'hear?
Of course! I'll call if there're any updates.
...
Aoba... Where is everyone?
They went back to school.\nJun, I'm terribly worried about you...
I understand...
...
Don't let yourself get depressed, Jun.
If you skip the next game, if you give yourself\ntime to recover, you can still have your\nrematch with Tsubasa.
I'm sorry, Aoba. Could you just leave me\nalone for a bit? Please?
...
Alright...
(It's happening again...\nIt's happening to me all over again...)
(I've never hated my stupid body\nmore than I do today!)
(My body will always stop me from competing...\nI can just kiss my dream goodbye!)
(And with it, any hope of a rematch...)
(Musashi faces Toho Academy next. Last time,\nat the Tokyo tournament, we lost. And Hyuga can\nonly have gotten stronger since then...)
(If I'm perfectly honest with myself, Musashi has\nlittle to no chance of winning without me.)
(The only hope we have of winning...)
(...is <avatar_name>.)
(If he can lead everyone on the team... If he can\nbring them together... They might have a chance.)
Look how one-sided the game was...
Wakashimazu is an iron wall between us and the\ngoal. Sawada attacks us relentlessly from the\nmidfield. Sorimachi is just waiting to score.
And then there's Hyuga's Tiger Shot...
How much better must they have gotten\nsince we played against them at Tokyo?
Probably a lot. We're talkin' about the team\nthat took home Nationals.
Compared to Toho, we're still playing catch-up.
We've just been relying on Misugi this whole\ntime, and they've actually been improving.\nWe stopped growing...
I've been practicing so hard every day, and yet...
We're basically a bunch of wimps.\nWe can't beat Toho...
Where's your fighting spirit?!\nYou're third-years, not kindergartners, right?!
Listen to yourselves! You're so whiny!
<avatar_name>...
<avatar_name>...!
Be more like Misugi! He rises to any\nchallenge!
Don't you want to make up for\nyour loss at Nationals?!
Grow up! For Misugi's sake!
What happened to the brave athletes\nI called teammates?!
Be determined... like Misugi...
That day... I've always regretted that day!
For... Misugi?
Brave... Until now, we've been...
Listen to <avatar_name>!
Honma?
Misugi's been battling his illness for the last\ntwo years, all just to play soccer! And we've just\nbeen leaning on him this whole year!
Back in the finals of the Tokyo games,\nMisugi risked his life just to play,\nand I failed him at the very end.
I've never regretted anything more!\nI've never felt worse!
All I want now is to make his dream come true!
Honma... You...
I'll find a way! I'll crush Toho, and bring\nMisugi to the finals with a perfect win streak!
It's my dream to be like Misugi... But I haven't\nhelped him achieve any of his own dreams...
That changes now! I'm going to get\nMisugi his rematch with Tsubasa Ozora!
Honma...
We all let Misugi down in that final game,\nnot just Honma. I share some of the blame, too.
Before the tournament, we all swore to win!\nNow Misugi's spirit will be with us\nas we take on Toho!
You said it!\nWe can still make Misugi's dream come true!
Only we can win him the opportunity to rematch\nTeam Nankatsu and Tsubasa Ozora!
Tak! And we can't win if we're moping around.
We still have time before the match with\nToho Academy! We have to train all we can!
Tak!
Okay, we've talked enough. Let's get to work.
First up is our analysis of Toho Academy's\nstrengths and weaknesses...
Check everything about their recent\ngames carefully! They have to have\na weak spot somewhere!
Go ask your teachers to borrow more computers!\nWe can't go through all their games\nwith just one screen!
And go ask to use the soccer field until late!
Out there, we can be Misugi's legs!
Let's show Misugi how strong we've\nbecome!
Tak!
Heck yeah!
Alright, everyone... Do you see any\nweak spots in Toho's playstyle?
Nah, they're pretty airtight.\nThis is gonna be tough...
No kidding. Hyuga and the other players are on a\nwhole 'nother level since the last time we played.
Until the semi-finals of Nationals, that is.\nThen they were playing without Hyuga,\nand they got sloppier...
All the mistakes they make...\nIs it because they're thinking, "I have to\ndo this without Hyuga?"
Heheh... Kinda funny, isn't it?\nShoe's on the other foot now.
Then that means it's on us\nto rise to the challenge.
<avatar_name>, does anything\ncatch your eye about Toho's playstyle?
Hyuga on offense...
Sawada at midfield...
Wakashimazu on defense...
Tak! His kicks are enough to split concrete.\nEspecially, what he calls his Tiger Shot!
But look at Nankatsu's defense!\nThey blocked a bunch of his shots anyway.
Yeah. We'll have to spread ourselves\nthin on defense...
Come to think of it, <avatar_name>,\nyou're the same age as Sawada was then.
Sawada can win the entire game by himself\nif you take your eyes off him.\nWe gotta watch him closely.
We need to watch where he heads after\nthey break their starting formation.\nHe has to have some kind of habit...
Back in the Tokyo finals, I had the best\npossible shot on Wakashimazu. But even then,\nI couldn't get a goal in...
Wakashimazu is a real beast...
And now he's the number one goalkeeper in Japan.\nBut that doesn't mean he's invincible...
There's a way past any goalkeeper.\nThere has to be a way past him...
...Yeah, that might be it.
Do you see something, Honma?
Not about Toho... I see something about us.
What do you mean?
This summer, only three players have scored goals\nagainst Toho Academy.
Misugi, Tsubasa...
...and Sawaki, from Meiwa Higashi.
Now, I'm not saying Sawaki's a bad player,\nbut he doesn't have anywhere near the skill of\nMisugi or Tsubasa. But he still scored.
The same is true of us. None of us can stack up\nto Misugi or Tsubasa either, so we should look\ncloser at how Sawaki was able to score.
You might be on to something!
It was the semifinals of Nationals. Meiwa\nHigashi's entire team converged on the goal. It\nwas chaos, and in the confusion, Sawaki scored.
It's an all-or-nothing strategy.\nIf we're not all committed and in unison when\nwe swarm the goal, it'll be a disaster.
But if that's our only play, we don't have much\nof a choice. And when I think about it...
I mean, I can dig a little chaos.
That explains the state of your homework.
Okay, one plan on the books...\nUntil the night staff forces us out,\nlet's keep studying tape for more strats!
Okay, so now, let's watch each\nposition to see how all their players\nreact to a midfield defense...
Starting tomorrow morning,\nwe'll practice based off our observations!
Let's do it!
The following morning...
OK, after we're done warming up,\nlet's practice our strategy from yesterday!
Alright, we'll divide up into offense and\ndefense, but we all know the game is\nREALLY gonna be decided in the box.
The attackers win if they score a goal.\nObviously. But the defense wins if they\nget the ball out of the penalty area.
Alright, let's get this started!
Okay, cross it in front of the goal!\nJust like that!
Now! Everybody swarm the goal!
Take the shot!
It's not over yet! I won't just let you shoot!
I'm open!
Oh no, you're not!
<avatar_name>! Go for it!
Goalie!
Nice try! It's my ball now!
It's wide open!
Eh, you blocked it?!
You almost had it, <avatar_name>!
So close, yet so far...
No point dwelling on it.
Yeah, it was super close. So take the\nnext step, and push yourself harder!
Exactly! Put a little more oomph in it.
No! I was a split-second too late!
Of course! The goalie has to predict where the\nball is gonna be. After they take a few steps out,\nwe can shoot for the space they leave exposed.
That's the way!
Problem is, it'll only take the Toho Academy\nplayers an instant to react to where\nthe ball is really going.
In that instant, we have to line up the ball\nwith the goal, and shoot. Both have to\nhappen almost immediately.
One other thing, Ichinose.
There's always a chance the ball ricochets off a\ngoal post, so you gotta be ready to head it in.
Tak! So if there's a spilled ball, we have to be\non it in an instant, and knock it into the goal.
We have to be hyper-aware of the ball. Like,\nmore aware of the ball than our own heartbeat.
OK, let's run through it one more time!
Kido, you're on fire! The ball was so close!
Center your thoughts and strike.
Alright, here I go!
Ngh!
Kido, can this even work!
I know exactly what I'm doing, Mukai.
Hyuga's Tiger Shot is still scary, though. Got\nhalf a mind to just run when I see him coming.
Heh... No joke. So let's call this training\nfor my confidence, too. I've gotta be ready\nto block him with any part of my body!
Uhhh, but if you block him with any part of\nyour body, won't you get bruised from head to toe?
Probably. But if I can block a goal,\na bruise is a small price to pay!
I can't lose to Kido!\nNext time, that ball is getting in!
Gotta treat this like Hyuga's Tiger Shot!\nAlright, I'm ready and waiting!
Okay, going off of our observations yesterday...\nWhen Sawada passes, it usually goes\nto either Hyuga or Sorimachi.
So blocking Sawada is the best way to keep\nHyuga and Sorimachi from getting the ball!
Victory might just come down to\nwhat we can do in the midfield...
Man, how does Misugi do it...?
Eureka!
Something just occurred to me...
If Sawada is really that good, but Misugi can\nstill block him anyway, then Misugi has to have\na way of predicting his movements, right?
Hey, yeah!
Maybe you do have a brain after all, Sanada!
Hey, shut up. Too much thinking\ngets in the way of the game!
Oh, that's perfect.\nWe should print that on our jerseys.
OK, enough goofing around!\nLet's move into the second half!
We'll have a ten minute break before we start.\nKeep yourselves hydrated and watch\nyour salt intake!
You got it!
How ya feelin', <avatar_name>?\nWe been at it for a while today. You tired?
I'm fine! This is what I live for, man!
I'm beat. Stick a fork in me, I'm done.
It's all for Misugi! I'll keep going.
You're unreal, dude. Wish I had a way to\nbottle up that energy of yours and sell it.
You really love soccer, don't you?
For real. I'm gonna sleep like the dead tonight.
Me three. Sleep well because you know what\nwe're doing tomorrow? More practice.
To tell the truth, I like it. Right now,\nthe only thing we have to focus on is soccer.
I know, right? Misugi chose us to be his\nteammates, and now it's time to repay him!
Heh. You're a good teammate, <avatar_name>!
Hey, <avatar_name>, could you\ngrab me a sports drink?
Could I get one, too, please?
Our team really has changed...\nIt's all thanks to <avatar_name>.
Like, I've had the benefit of playing with Misugi\nthis whole time to learn soccer and discipline\nand all that jazz. But he hasn't.
He's our junior, but he's fearless. He stepped up\nto lead our team. That kind of grit is amazing.
Yeah. I get why Misugi chose him now.
If he wasn't there yesterday, when Misugi's heart\nnearly gave out, I don't know if we would've\nrecovered. We might've all crumbled.
He was there to give us the kick in the pants\nwe needed to snap out of it.
Well, I mean, Honma did bear his soul to us,\npretty much. Credit to him for having the guts to\nput himself out like that. Let's not forget that.
Uh, I-I mean... It wasn't that big a deal.
Honestly, looking back on it...\nThat was so embarrassing.
Pfft. Whatever you say, man. But me\nand Sanada got nothing but respect for ya.
Pretty much.
Well, anyway... For Misugi, and for\n<avatar_name>, we gotta give it our all!
You said it!
Let's keep at it and spend\nthe whole day practicing!
We'll pour our entire souls into it! For Misugi!
Alright!
For today, there are no limits!
Everyone is working so late...
The game against Toho Academy...\nThe day's finally here.
Play with everything you've got!
I couldn't ask for a better team!
Win one for Misugi!
Tak! We'll play 'til we drop!
I wouldn't expect anything less!\nLeave everything on the pitch!
Tak! We'll fulfill Misugi's dream!
Hey, Honma!
Yeah?
For today's game, will you be the captain?
Me... the captain?!
When we faced off against Toho last time,\nyou were the most crushed after by our loss.
And you're the one who inspired our\nspecial training these last few days.
Yeah, Honma. You make sense\nas the captain for today.
We need your passion today most of all, Honma!
Guys...
...All right. I'll do it!
Only the thing is, I'm not like Misugi.\nI don't know how to use you guys effectively.
But there's one thing we do have in common...\nGiving everything to win! No surrender!
Give me all your strength, everyone!\nLet's kick Toho off their pedestal!
All the way!
We're entrusting our fate to you, Captain!
We've been a shadow of our former selves\never since we lost at the Tokyo finals.\nLet's reclaim our lost glory!
Where's Misugi?
Misugi is... taking a break. So he can\nhave all his strength for the final game.
So... Today, what you see is what you get.\nWe're your challengers!
What?! He underestimates us so much that he's\njust kickin' back and watching TV right now?
Musashi without Misugi is hardly a team at all!\nYou should've learned to respect us\nwhen we whupped your butts in Tokyo!
Don't count us out yet!\nWe're a different team now!
Same goes for us, dude! Do you know how much\nstronger we've gotten since Tokyo?
Well, it doesn't matter if Misugi is here or not.\nWe're still gonna obliterate ya!
Now you'll see the power of the new\nMusashi MS for yourselves!
On the pitch, it's do or die.\nThat's what I believe.
Kiss your dreams goodbye\ncuz I'm not showing any restraint.
Time to cage the tiger!
Let's just have a good game.
Yo, Takeshi! It's game time!
Nice to see you came armed...\nat least with clever banter.
So be it! My Tiger Shot will rip you to shreds!
You mean to stand toe to toe with me and\ngo head to head? Such brash confidence.
This is just the way I like it!\nI'm comin' for you!
Very well, then! Let me show\nyou what true skill looks like.
Wait, wha...?!
Pretty bold just ignoring me.
You need a lesson in manners, punk!\nYou wanted me angry? You got it!
(Wait, is this a part of their strategy?\nGoading Hyuga into coming after them? Are they\ntrying to get us to break our formation?)
We... We did it!
We won! We really won!
W-We won! Against Toho Academy!\nWe actually pulled it off!
How... How'd we screw up this badly?! We... lost.
How's this even possible?!
How'd Musashi MS ever get this strong?!
...
Honma.
Wakashimazu.
You fought like your lives depended on it. Your\ndrive was... awe-inspiring. How'd you pull it off?
We had to redeem ourselves for the Tokyo finals.\nWe had to do it for Misugi and for ourselves,\ntoo. That debt is paid, now.
That's all there is to it.
I see...
Back in Tokyo, it was me who stopped your last\nshot. Guess the tables have turned this time.
Unfortunately, we just couldn't compete with\nyour intensity. You won, fair and square.
You've only got one game left. Give it your all.
We will!
(I just couldn't stop them from scoring goals.\nMisugi, Tsubasa, now that first-year... Could\na kid that young already play like a captain?!)
(Nah, it must just be a fluke...\nExcept, no... Maybe not...)
(I'm sure that <avatar_name> will be on the\nteam representing Japan. I'd bet my life on it.)
(I know true talent when I see it.)
(<avatar_name> can pass like nobody's business...\nWho knew there was someone like him,\ncompletely flying under the radar?)
(But that's all the better for me!\nI'll rematch him next year and the year after!)
(I'll take up Hyuga's mantle, and carry\nTeam Toho into the future! I'll bring home\nevery championship I can!)
(And next time, I'll take home the cup!)
Guys?!
Aoba...
Wait, no way...!
Misugi!
What are you doin' here, Misugi?!
You should be in the hospital, man...
I heard from Aoba how hard everyone was working.\nI had to come and see the game with my own eyes.
How you guys played today...\nI'm so proud. I don't have the words.
I'm so thankful for every single one of you...
We did it all for you, Misugi!
I led the team in your place,\njust like you wanted!
For... For me?
You sure did, <avatar_name>! You did better\nthan even Misugi could've hoped for!
<avatar_name>, you're...\nYou're a true friend and teammate.
We all had to make sure your dream came true,\nMisugi! We never gave up! We ran around doing\neverything humanly possible!
The stage is set for a grand finale!\nWe're rematching Tsubasa with a\nperfect win streak behind us!
Wait. How did you know what my dream was...?
Uhhh...
Well, uh... Y-You know...
Sorry, Misugi... We called Tsubasa,\nand we spoke to people at the Soccer Association.\nAnd we kinda, uh... eavesdropped on you earlier.
It felt terrible, hearing about how bad you\nwanted to rep Japan... But at least we can do\nsomething about your dream of having a rematch!
There's no time for regrets! The final match\nof the Junior Hero League is soon.\nWe gotta rest and get our strength back.
And when we rematch Nankatsu, we'll meet\nTsubasa on the field with all our might!
Guys...!
...
(Since elementary school, I've wanted to face\nTsubasa again. That goal has guided my life...\nI'm still playing soccer because of it.)
(Granted, when I was elementary school, I was\npicked to be captain, so maybe...\nmaybe it's a lot of things that led me here.)
(I have to lead the team to victory.\nI've never forgotten that responsibility.)
(And yet, despite everything that happens...\nIt's always ME at the center of the team.)
(Everything I am today, I am because of soccer.)
(But even saying that, the team managed to\ncome out ahead in dire straits without me.)
We all had to make sure your dream came true,\nMisugi! We never gave up! We ran around doing\neverything humanly possible!
(They did it for me. They beat Toho Academy.\nAnd they did it on their own.)
(I don't think Musashi MS has ever had\na stronger showing.)
(In the few days when I wasn't there,\nthey buckled down and grew as a team.)
(And then...)
There's no time for regrets! The final match\nof the Junior Hero League is soon.\nWe gotta rest and get our strength back.
And when we rematch Nankatsu, we'll meet\nTsubasa on the field with all our might!
(I have to repay their determination.)
(For everyone that worked so tirelessly for me...\nAs captain, I have to pay them back!)
Jun, we should be getting back to the hospital.
Yeah...
(Even though my dream of representing Japan is\nlost to me... I have to do something for them!)
We're doing another special\ntraining program today, <avatar_name>.
This time your opponent\nwill be a little different.
But I know you'll put up a good fight. Good luck!
Alright, that's good!
You're a force, <avatar_name>.\nYou're even better than I'd hoped.
I hope you'll keep up the good work and push\nyourself beyond what any of us could expect.
<avatar_name>, I can tell you're trying,\nbut I had hoped for so much more from you.
Not only can you be better than this, but you\nare. I know it. Don't stop pushing yourself!
Okay, we'll take a breather,\nbut then it's back to training!
We're doing another special\ntraining program today, <avatar_name>.
This time your opponent will be a little\ndifferent.
But I know you'll put up a good fight.\nGood luck!
That's enough!
You're a force, <avatar_name>.\nYou're even better than I'd hoped.
I hope you'll keep up the good work and push\nyourself beyond what any of us could expect.
<avatar_name>, I can tell you're trying,\nbut I had hoped for so much more from you.
Not only can you be better than this, but you\nare. I know it. Don't stop pushing yourself!
Okay, we'll take a little break and then it's back\nto training!
It's finally the big day.
I've been thinking about this moment for the\nlast three years. I finally get my rematch with\nTsubasa.
Tsubasa is no match for you, Misugi!
I hope you're right. Everyone, this game will\nrequire your complete attention and focus!
Don't forget, the game isn't just about Tsubasa.\nWe've got the rest of Team Nankatsu to worry\nabout. We gotta do something about them!
Guys...
(It wasn't my dream that made me who I am.\nThe team has always relied on me... so I became\nstrong for them. So I would never let them down.)
Everyone... Thank you.
Don't get me wrong, I'm excited for the rematch...
But facing Tsubasa isn't everything.
Huh?
Battle Tsubasa and win... Finish the\nJunior Hero League with a perfect win streak...\nThat was what I wanted to achieve.
But... The best schools in the country all came\nto this tournament. Yet in the end,\nit's Musashi that's in the finals.
Today, I'm not fighting for my dream!\nI'm fighting for all of you! For Musashi MS!
Misugi...!
And to make sure this new dream comes true,\nI'm going to play for the entire game!
What?!
D-Dude... Can your body handle that?!
It can. This isn't a spur of the moment decision.\nI've had a full physical and my condition\nhas been stabilized, at least for today.
(Even though I know there's no way for me\nto represent Japan now, I can't help\nbut dwell on it.)
(This is my last game of middle school soccer...\nI've prepared myself for it.)
Doesn't matter how strong Musashi MS has gotten\nsince last time. If Misugi is playing a full game,\nwe'll have 'em runnin' scared!
Then... Misugi, if you're gonna be playing\nthe whole time, make a promise to us.
A promise?
If you feel ill or start getting weak,\nyou have to stop playing. Immediately.\nPromise us that. Please.
And if you do have to stop, don't worry.\nWe'll find our way to victory.
When we're on the field, we'll give it everything\nwe got! We can be heroes today!
I have the best team...
Thank you. Thank you for being who you are.
It's time. Let's head down to the soccer field.
Let's win this thing!
Going up against Nankatsu...\nEvery single one of them are worthy opponents.
Hey, <avatar_name>! Lemme hear your war cry!
Let's do our best!
Complete and total victory!
I'll clip Tsubasa's wings!
Tak! We'll pour our souls into this match!
Tak! This will be Musashi's crowning achievement!
Oh, <avatar_name>, I didn't realize\nyou were also excited to battle Tsubasa.
I feel the same way, of course! When you throw\nyourself into a challenge, it's all or nothing!
This is it, everyone!
We're right behind you, Captain!
Under this azure summer sky,\nthe day has finally arrived.
Two teams will take the field, but only one will\nbe crowned champion of the Junior Hero League!\nWill it be Nankatsu or Musashi?
Nankatsu is a powerhouse among middle school\nteams, recently taking home a third straight\nNational championship title!
Their captain Tsubasa Ozora was injured at\nNationals but now looks to have returned\nfighting fit.
Their opponents: Musashi MS, who've made a\nstunning comeback after being defeated in the\nTokyo finals! They'd actually missed Nationals.
Handicapped by a heart defect, Musashi's captain\nJun Misugi is captivating on the field! Known as\na genius, can his smarts lead Musashi to victory?!
Despite not having their beloved captain in the\nlast game, Musashi MS won against Toho Academy!\nThey've grown into a force to be reckoned with!
And what's more, Musashi is joined by a wild card\nfirst-year player, who has played a key role in\nthe team's success in this league!
Both of these teams have made it to this final\nmatch with a perfect win streak up to this point!
But don't be fooled into thinking this is just\nany match! The winners will be the top team\nin the league! These are the league finals!
It's almost time for the starting whistle, folks!
Tsubasa... The day's finally here.
So it is! I've been looking forward to this\nfor a long time, Misugi!
I'll be playing for the whole match, this time.\nDon't you dare hold back on me.
Misugi...
Don't worry, Tsubasa. This isn't like\nelementary school. You can come at me\nwith everything you've got!
You got it, Misugi!\nThen that's exactly what you'll get!
I can't believe I actually get to play a whole\nmatch against you... This is gonna be great!
I've long dreamt of this day, too, Tsubasa.
There was more I'd hoped to do, but...
But I can still win against you\nand against Nankatsu!
Kid, I've taken a good look at your work so far.
Even though it's still kinda an exhibition match,\nI'm glad we get to play one another\nthanks to this new league.
This is it. Let's make it a good one!
Yeah, good luck, have fun!
Today, I become number one in Japan!
There's no way I can lose!
Back at ya. I'm jumpin' out of my skin already!
Let's have a good, clean match! I've saved up\nall the strength I could muster for this day.
I've been waiting for a challenger\nwith your kind of ambition.
Bring it on!
It is not my fate to lose today!
Is that arrogance... or confidence?\nHeh, I think you're the kind of challenger\nI've been waiting for.
We're going to have fun on the field.
Taking home the championship of the\nJunior Hero League with a perfect win streak,\nit's Tokyo's own Musashi Middle School!
How... could I lose...?
Sorry to butt in, Tsubasa,\nbut this doesn't make you a bad player...
I know, Ishizaki. They had the\nbetter showing, plain and simple.
Today, Misugi was beyond anything\nwe could conjure up.
We won! We really won!
Today, we're victorious, Misugi!
Is this real? Someone tell me this isn't a dream!
It's no dream, dude! It's the real deal!\nWe actually won!
We won... I guess all that hard work\nreally did pay off...
Quit crying, Kido! Ya big baby!\nYou're... you're gonna make me cry, too!
We've earned a few tears.
Tears are good, but smile, too!
This is just a stop on the road!
Tak! With how hard we've been working...\nWe've at least earned that much!
I... I don't know if I've ever\nfelt this happy before!
Hey... I can only do so much\nI'm not an actor, y'know!
But somehow... That's exactly what I feel\nmy face doing anyway!
Heh... You can be pretty cool\nsometimes, <avatar_name>.
Not just sometimes. You're not a regular dude,\nyou know? You're exceptional.
Thank you, everyone. Because of all of you,\nI achieved my dream in the exact way I wanted.
I'm... I'm so grateful that\nI didn't have to give up on it!
This wasn't just YOUR dream today, Misugi!
Exactly right! It was everybody's dream!
To have a dream I could take charge of, and see\naccomplished on the national stage... You really\nare the best captain in the world, Misugi!
You guys are the best...
Misugi.
Tsubasa.
...
Is something the matter?
Nah, just...
Look, when we dominated all three years at\nNationals, I figured I was done with Japan.\nI was going to move to Brazil and go pro...
At least, that's what I thought.
But the way you handled the ball out on the\nfield... I realized I've just been coasting.
There was such a perfect unity to your team.\nIt was palpable... Everyone on your team was\nconstantly thinking, "For Misugi!"
But you weren't just thinking of yourself.\nI could tell you were thinking, "For everyone!"\nIt was different than when we fought before.
So after everything I just saw, I think\nit's pretty obvious that I haven't been\npushing myself as hard as you.
Sure, we'd been through Nationals a few times,\nand I thought we were growing...
I figured, if we beat you back then, we could\nbeat you here. That's what I kept telling myself.
Tsubasa...
Thanks, Misugi. You and your\nteam pulled me back to reality.
I love this game, and I have no plans to go on\nlosing. It's time to put my ego aside and put my\nheart back into it.
Congratulations, Misugi. I'm so glad I got to\nplay a whole match against you.
Let's play again someday! And next time,\nI'LL be the one making a comeback!
Tak! Play even more with your team\nand grow together!
(That's what I'm striving to be... Someone who\ncan score goals while still being a team player.)
(I wasn't able to be that today, but now I have\nsomeone to look to: <avatar_name>!)
(I'm sure that <avatar_name> will be on the\nteam representing Japan. I'd bet my life on it.)
(But I'll be right behind him! The representative\nteam better not give the #10 jersey to anyone!)
(That feeling I had when I first met\n<avatar_name> on the field... I can't remember\nthe last time I had a shock like that!)
(He's just like Hyuga was...\nMaybe even better than Hyuga was at his age!)
(I regret that the first time we met\nwas my last game in Japan...)
(If we could've met sooner,\nwho knows what could've...)
Misugi.
Mr. Katagiri...
Congratulations on winning the league with a\nperfect record. Your match with Tsubasa,\nespecially, was a sight to behold.
You've proven, yet again, what an indispensable\nresource you are to any Japanese soccer team.
I... don't know about that...
Well, Mr. Katagiri, I suppose we should get right\nto the point. About being a representative...
I couldn't meet the condition\nof playing in every match.
...
I won't lie, I'm disappointed I won't be repping\nJapan. But for my own sake, I think\nit's important I start studying to be a coach.
So if your offer still stands, would you please\nallow me to be the coach for the All-Japan Team?
Of course, you can. The job is still open.
Thank you.
And your spot as a player is also still open.
What?!
B-But I couldn't meet all your conditions!
But you played for the entire game today.\nThat's the same as playing two games\nin your usual condition.
Speaking of which, your condition seems to have\nimproved. The Soccer Association has ruled\nyour health is not an issue.
Mr. Katagiri...!
That's to say nothing of your skill or your head\nfor tactics. Your passion for soccer is beyond\nreproach. These are all traits I look for.
The Soccer Association has decided to invite\nyou both as a coach and a player.
I... get to be on the All-Japan Team...
Th-Thank you! Thank you so much!
Ah, I haven't even spoken to the other\nplayers yet. Perhaps, I've said too much.
Well, the closing ceremony will begin soon.\nYou should get going.
I-I will! Thank you again!
And so, the Junior Hero League, an exhibition\nleague to choose who will represent Japan,\nhas finally come to a close.
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament: Somehow, it's the\nnewcomer from Musashi, <avatar_name>!
New stars are raining down on us like comets,\nfolks! It's this moment when our winners\nreally get to feel like Junior Heroes!
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament: The newcomer from\nMusashi, <avatar_name>!
<avatar_name> is also the top-scoring\nplayer of the tournament!\nWhy, it's a veritable double crown, folks!
What a meteoric rise for our debut star!\nHe is certainly the kind of junior hero that\nthis league was named for!
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament: the captain of\nMusashi MS and an inspiring young man, Jun Misugi!
And the top-scoring player of the tournament,\nis the newcomer from Musashi, <avatar_name>!
He earned recognition by sweeping past strikers,\nwhich is all the more impressive!
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament: the captain of\nMusashi MS and an inspiring young man, Jun Misugi!
And now, given the results of the Junior Hero\nLeague, 21 of the best players have been\nannounced to be Japan's representatives!
From Musashi MS, Misugi and <avatar_name>!
These 21 players will represent Japan at an\nInternational Tournament to be held in America\nnext month!
This golden generation of soccer players will\nface off against the world's best! Listen up!
Thank you all for coming. My name\nis Mikami, and I will be coaching\nthe All-Japan Junior Youth team.
Next month is the Junior Youth World Challenge\ntournament in America.
Each of you has been specifically chosen to join\nthe team Japan is sending to that tournament.
Wait, really?! I'm going to America\nto represent Japan?
Exactly.
I get to represent Japan!\nI would've never dreamed...
Starting in three days, you're going to be housed\ntogether as a team. Settle whatever other\naffairs you may have and get ready by then.
Members of the Soccer Association\nwill explain the rest.
That's all I have to tell you for now.
Congratulations, Misugi!
And <avatar_name>, too, of course!\nI've got two prodigies for teammates!
And we won the Junior Hero League!\nWe have so much to celebrate!
But after so much hardship, it's all worth it!
And just when we were getting used to\nyou guys being regular players like us, heh.
Thank you, everyone!
You're the real hero of the\nJunior Hero League, <avatar_name>.
Misugi is an obvious choice, but you really\nrose to the challenge, <avatar_name>!
Tak! I knew it would happen!
The dude's just got good instincts.
Heh...
Of course, <avatar_name> does!\nThat's why I picked him!
But I never thought you would come this far,\nif I'm being honest.
There are so many players who can never reach\nyour level, even with practice.
But you did so well in every game...\nIt was such a heartening thing to see!
Grit! That's the word!\nIt's so important in soccer!
It's about more than how you play, though.\nHe was able to lead us when we needed it!
Especially while Misugi was gone.\nIt was your encouragement that saved us!
Huh? What happened?
Uhhh... Well, while you were gone,\nHonma and <avatar_name> were able\nto rally us out of our slump.
Aw, c'mon now!
Well, when Misugi wasn't there,\nit was <avatar_name> that led the team.
So for that match, you were the one\nwho brought the team together?
I can't believe it... You're so much\nmore than I ever expected!
You've done so well, <avatar_name>!
Tak! I knew you had to have some talent because\nMisugi picked you, but you were stellar!
You're an essential part of the\nteam now, <avatar_name>!
You were exactly what we needed, <avatar_name>.
Thank you again, <avatar_name>.
When I couldn't play, when I couldn't be there,\nthank you for being able to unite everyone.
And I don't just mean the other teammates.\nEven I, as Captain, took inspiration from you.
You're a good teammate. And maybe\neven a good rival... Let's continue\nour coalition on the All-Japan Team!
I'm looking forward to playing with you!
Not gonna let you outshine me, Misugi!
Coalition?
I'm going to be trusting you with\nso much more as we go forward.
There aren't many players who can\ninspire that kind of confidence in me.\nIt's so welcome to see it from you!
Ha! That's exactly how I like it!
But the same goes for you,\nso don't feel bad when I win!
I don't make a habit of losing, as you've seen!
Uh. Have... Have you really not learned that\nword by your first year of middle school...?
Welp, guess now we know what <avatar_name>\npaid for all that soccer talent with.
Well, Misugi can teach you during\nthe World Youth Championship!
Tak! You guys will be on the\ninternational stage soon!
Remember, you're representing us, too!
Misugi, <avatar_name>...\nShow the whole world how Musashi fights!
Okay! Fifteen wind sprints! Idziemy!
Idziemy!
Don't cheat yourselves!\nTired or not, give this everything you've got!\nThis is how we win the big games!
Y-Yes, Sir!
Alright! Catch your breath!\nMake sure you stay hydrated!
Working 'em hard, Ishizaki?
You bet! Who else is gonna push 'em?
More like you just don't\nwanna study for exams, right?
Ha ha, very funny.
Still, it's only been a few days since we won at\nNationals, and it already feels like a hundred\nyears ago.
It still hasn't sunk in for me. We pulled\noff a three-peat. That's kinda... amazing?
Too bad Toho gets to keep the championship banner\nfor another six months. At least, we'll get it\nback before graduation, even if only barely.
So uh, what're you guys doing here?
Hey, don't tell me you forgot! Today's the day\nthird years were gonna clean up the club room.
Wait, really? Sorry, that totally slipped my mind.
Where's Tsubasa, though?\nI could swear we reminded him when to meet up.
Oh, he shot me a message. He said the hospital\nwas crowded, so he's running a little late.
Come to think of it, Morisaki's not here either.\nI thought he said he'd be minding the younger\nplayers with you, Ishizaki.
Oh, the coach called him into\nthe staff room a little while ago.
Oh, okay.
Oh, I know!\nWant something to do while you wait for Tsubasa?
We were right about to split up for a\npractice match, so how about you join in?
Sounds great!\nIt's been days since I kicked a ball around!
Count me in, too!
Alright! Then start warming up,\nand I'll make the teams!
Hey, <avatar_name>! You were looking pretty good!\nYou're the standout from the younger\ncrowd for sure.
Yeah, I agree. You were awesome out there.
Tsubasa!
Tsubasa!
Sorry I'm late, guys.\nThat check-up took more time than I expected.
So how're you feelin'?
Well, I'm not really in pain anymore at least.
They say it'll still be a while until I can\nstart playing again, but it's looking good.
Whew, that's a relief.
But man, seeing you guys play... It's like having\nan itch I can't scratch! I just want to get in\nthere!
Some things never change.
Anyway, since Tsubasa's here,\nwe'd better get cleaning.
Whoa there, Morisaki! What's got you so worked up?
Th-This is big, you guys!
"Junior Hero League"?
Th-That's right.
I was talking to the coach about the training\nschedule, when he got a call from the Soccer\nAssociation.
Supposedly, there's going to be an exhibition\ntournament to pick who gets to represent Japan\nin America next month.
No way!
So you're telling me they're making it a\ntournament and a qualifier at the same time?
Exactly. So Coach talked to the principal,\nand we're gonna be in it!
F-For real?!
Wait, so are us third years in on this, too?!
That's what I heard!\nThe whole team, no matter what age!
That's crazy!
So what other schools are gonna be there?
I thought you might ask. I brought a list!
Good lookin' out!
Let's see here...
Whoa... Looks like fourteen teams total,\nsplit into two sets of seven.
So who's in our league? Who're we gonna face?
Um... Toho, Musashi, Furano...
Seriously? Those are all killer teams!
Well, since they're using it to pick the\nnational reps, they probably put all the\nbest teams together on purpose.
...
What's wrong, Tsubasa?
I don't think I've ever felt... this happy.
Even if they're just exhibition matches, we get\nto play against the best teams from Nationals\nall over again.
Throw in the fact that we might even end up taking\non the best in the world... My heart's racing!
(This is my chance! I have to get picked\nas a rep, so I can play against the best\nthe world has to offer!)
Tsubasa.
Oh! Mr. Katagiri!
We just heard about the Junior Hero League!
Good timing. That's what I'm here to discuss.
I'm gonna set that field on fire! When people see\nme in the Junior Hero League, I'll be a shoe in\nfor the national team.
Well, the thing is...
I'd prefer it if you focused on\nrecovering from your injuries.
B-But...
We need you representing us to the world, Tsubasa.\nEveryone who saw you at Nationals would agree,\nand so does the selection committee.
We can't risk you exacerbating your injuries\non the field. We need you at your best for the\ninternational tournament.
Just keep it in mind.\nThat's all I came to ask of you.
But I...
...
Sorry man, but what he's saying makes sense.
Morisaki...
Yeah, I agree. After what you did at Nationals,\nyou're a sure pick anyway.
Yeah, definitely.\nNo one else is fit to wear #10 for Japan.
But that's why we need your injuries\ncompletely healed. This is for you\nas much as it is for the team.
I dunno much about teams outside of Japan, but\nyou can bet they'll have their own share of aces.
To face that, we'll need you\nplaying at your absolute best.
But...
Look, Tsubasa. I'm not going to tell you,\nyou can't play in the Junior Hero League.
Once the doctors say you're good to go,\nby all means, go wild.
But your friends are right. We need you at your\nbest to take on the international teams, so I'm\nasking you to please be patient.
...
He's right Tsubasa.\nThey're absolutely going to pick you, regardless.
Besides, don't you wanna play against the world's\nbest without worrying what shape your leg's in?
Of course, I do...
I've been with you since the beginning, Tsubasa.\nWhen healthy, you're better than anyone.
Which is exactly why I think you should\nlisten to what everyone's saying. All right?
...
Fine. I hear you.
But that doesn't mean I'm definitely accepting I\nwon't be able to play. I'm going to focus on my\nrehab, so I can make it back in time.
It's up to you guys until then!
You can count on us! Right guys?
Tak!
Hmm... So for now, how about\na training schedule like this?
So you're taking it easy for awhile, Tsubasa?
I'll still be practicing a little,\nbut I just need to not overdo it.
Not happening. What if it opens up your wound?\nYour chance at being a national rep will be blown.
They're calling these exhibition matches, but\nsince the spots on the national team are on the\nline, everyone's gonna be playing for keeps.
This'll be a grudge match for Furano\nafter Nationals, and no way Toho's\ngonna just roll over either.
But we're the three-time middle school soccer\nchamps. We're not going to start losing now.
Our win streak isn't going to end here, is it?
Of course not! We've got our pride on the line!
But winning's easier said than done,\nespecially without Tsubasa.
Yeah... That's for sure.
The question is who we bring on\nthe field to fill his position.
Maybe a forward? Beef up our front line.
Obviously, no one will be as good as Tsubasa,\nbut I wish we had another midfielder.\n"Whoever controls the midfield," and all that.
Well, without Tsubasa we can't count on having the\nsame offensive momentum, so maybe a defender would\nbe the way to go.
So... How about we pick someone\nfrom the younger players?
Huh?
Why would we do that?
I was discussing this with the coach earlier,\nbut we've pretty much relied on the third years\nall the way from the prelims to the championship.
Which means the underclassmen aren't getting much\nreal game experience. With the future of the team\nin mind, shouldn't we give them a chance?
Now that you mention it...
It's not like they can't pull their weight.\nJust look at Nitta from Otomo MS.
Yeah, and Takeshi and Sano\neven made it to Nationals.
I mean, wouldn't it be awesome if we were champs\nFOUR times in a row? Morisaki might be right,\nwe have a duty to give them that push.
Okay, so who's the best candidate?
How about <avatar_name>?
I thought he showed a lot of promise\nin the practice match just now.
<avatar_name>... Now that you mention,\nI've seen him copying some of your moves, Tsubasa.
He was looking pretty good, too.
Well, he's got guts at least. Why not!
Hey, can I have a word with you, <avatar_name>?
Sure! What is it?
Is it finally\nmy time to shine?
Um... Wh-What is it?
Thank you for making\nme a starter!
Wow, you're sure chipper\nafter practicing all morning!
Hey, that's what counts, right?
Whoa there, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
But confidence is important for playing well.\nI like it.
C'mon, what happened to that\nenergy from the practice match?
(Is he one of those people only\nconfident on the field...?)
H-Hold on, where'd that come from? Calm down.
But actually...
Basically, they're holding a new tournament,\nbut I'll be out for a while.
We need someone to fill in, and we thought\nit'd be a good idea for someone younger to\nget some time on the field.
That's where you come in. You played pretty good\nin the practice, but more importantly, you've got\nthe guts we're looking for!
But, to be blunt, the training the regulars do\nwill be way tougher than anything you're used to.
I know you can handle it though! C'mon, this\nis your chance to show us what you've got!
I'll try to be as good as you,\nTsubasa!
I'll be even better\nthan Tsubasa!
I won't lose to anyone!
The tougher the better!
Yeah, that's the spirit!
W-Wow... That's bold...
But it's just the right attitude!
That sounds like a challenge to me!
Well, I won't lose to you either!
Sounds like you've got promise!
But actions speak louder than words!\nShow us what you've got!
Don't be afraid to speak up just because\nwe've been with the team longer.
If you've got a question, ask away.\nWe're here to teach you everything we can.
It's normal to be anxious, but stick it out\nand you'll see results. That's guaranteed!
Whoops, I've gotta head home.\nIt's almost time for my Portuguese lesson.
Oh, right. Verb it up!
Ha! Thanks. See ya!
Tsubasa's incredible. He's been studying\nPortuguese for the last two years, all so\nhe can go to Brazil.
I mean, what choice does he have, if he wants to\ngo pro in another country? I bet he just thinks of\nit as more soccer practice.
Probably.
All right! Our training starts for real tomorrow!
Woohoo!
Junior Hero League: Day One
I'll never get used to how huge this stadium is...
How long have we been here again?
I don't remember...
You really didn't have to come all this way,\nTsubasa.
I wouldn't miss this for the world. Even if\nI'm benched, I'm still a part of this team.
I'll be right there with you from the stands.
Yeah, we'll do you proud, Tsubasa. We won't\nlet anyone sully the pride of Nankatsu!
But I'm impressed you could keep up with our\ntraining, <avatar_name>. You holding it together?
I'm beat...
You call that training?\nThat was nothing.
I've always got stamina\nleft over for soccer!
Figures. Anyone would be after suddenly\nramping up the training like that.
Just make sure to get some good sleep.\nIt makes all the difference.
You're an astounding player. I mean, that\ntraining is designed to be hard even for us.
Sounds like we made the right choice then!
That's an interesting way to put it...\nBut same here!
You really love soccer, huh <avatar_name>? I bet\neven I could learn a thing or two from you.
Oh right. Listen up, guys.
I can't come to practice for a while,\nand I won't be playing in games either.
So I want you to treat Ishizaki as the\nacting captain for the Junior Hero League.
Wha?! Me?!
Yeah. I think you're the man for the job.
You'll do fine, Ishizaki. Probably.
I mean, you're always leading practice anyway.\nI think you'll be great.
Do you intend not to do as our captain asks?
Me... The captain...
...
Got it. How could I say no? I'll do it!
Thanks, Ishizaki. Or should I say...\nCaptain Ishizaki!
I won't let you down!
Okay guys, let's head to the opening ceremony!
You said it, Captain!
The opening ceremony for the Junior Hero League\nsponsored by the Soccer Association will commence\nshortly.
Starting just this month, the best teams from\nNationals and even various regionals have\ngathered. But this is no mere exhibition.
The known goal of these games is that they will\ndetermine the players for the international\ntournament in America next month!
While the top schools facing off is one thing,\nindividual performance will also be important. The\ntop players are competing to represent our nation!
Who from among these teams will be chosen to\nstand as heroes representing all of Japan?
And here come the players now!
We made it here... somehow.
I'm impressed you were able to\norganize this on such short notice.
You and me both.
It was only possible thanks to all the\nparticipating schools being so accommodating.
I still can't believe the French International\nwas canceled and replaced with the\nJunior Youth World Challenge.
And now there'll be even more amazingly\ntalented teams from all over the world...
The training camp... The European tour... All\nthose carefully laid plans just went up in smoke.
Yes, they did.
Every match is an opportunity\nfor a player to grow.
Exactly. That's why this\nJunior Hero League is so important.
Knowing that this isn't just an exhibition, but\nthat we're selecting players to represent Japan,\nshould inspire everyone to do their best.
Hopefully, the players can build on the\npotential they showed at Nationals.
The Junior Hero League is a chance for us\nto see their growth as it happens.
That's another benefit to this.
We will have aided them in developing the kind of\nskill it takes to compete on the world stage.
Indeed. We've done our part.\nNow, we just have to give them our faith.
Alright guys, it's finally here:\nThe Junior Hero League.
None of our opponents are gonna be easy wins,\nand as three-time champs we've got a target on\nour backs. You can bet they're playing for keeps.
But don't forget THAT WE ARE the champs!\nWe're Nankatsu!\nBelieve in yourselves, and we can't lose!
None of them want to win this as much as we do!\nSo we will! We'll win this whole thing!
Tak!
Are you nervous, <avatar_name>?\nThis'll be your first match.
I'll show you I can\nfill your cleats!
N-Nervous? Maybe... Yes!
I can't wait to start!
Well, you certainly seem to have the heart for it.
But don't worry about being as good as Tsubasa.\nDon't be afraid to rely on the rest of us!
Heh, well I guess at least you're honest.
I can tell you're excited\njust by the look in your eyes.
That's the spirit to have! We're counting on you!
Just remember that the team's got your\nback out there and you'll do fine.\nI know you won't let us down!
Okay, well, I'll be cheering you on from\nthe stands. Go out there and win, guys!
Zróbmy to!
Hey <avatar_name>, can we talk?
We've got some of the best players on the Nankatsu\nMS team, but there are some amazing players across\nthe country.
The Junior Hero League is going to feature the\ncream of the crop. The best of the best.
If you stand out in your matches, others players\nwill take note and get acquainted with you.
You can get to know the other players and even\ncompete with them as rivals to help you improve\nyour own skills.
Don't miss out these opportunities! Now go and\ngive it all you've got!
Last time we played each other must've\nbeen back in elementary school.
Yup. But the teams are a\nlittle different this time.
Yeah. We used to have Hyuga, Takeshi, and\nWakashimazu, while you're missing Tsubasa,\nMisaki, and Wakabayashi.
But that makes it the perfect chance to test\nour teamwork, without any aces up our sleeves.
Right. But that's why you're going to lose!
The champs are going down today!
You wish!
Never underestimate Nankatsu!
All right! We won!
Grats on your first win as captain, Ishizaki!
Heh, thanks!
Gah... How could we lose?!
Hey, that was a good game.\nWe edged it out, but that was a close one.
If you think about it, you've got eight players\nfrom the old Meiwa FC, and we've got seven from\nNankatsu SC. If you count Tsubasa.
We've all been playing together so long, we know\neach other as well as we know our own teammates.\nWe're like mirror images of each other.
Hey... you guys are gonna keep\nplaying in high school, right?
Yeah, duh.
Then we'll be seeing each other for at least\nanother three years! And that's plenty opportunity\nto whup your butts!
Bring it on! We'll be waiting!
...
Sorry, Narita.
Hmm?
You weren't in Meiwa FC, right? Hate to make you\nfeel left out by all this talk about old rivalries\nand stuff.
What? No, don't worry about it.
Besides, you guys've told enough stories about\nit by now that it almost feels like I was there.
Heck, sometimes I even worry that I'll forget that\nI wasn't! And I'm sure Murasawa and Suenaga feel\nthe same way.
Narita...
Look Sawaki, everyone in Meiwa Higashi feels\nthe same way you do about losing here today.\nNone of us are outsiders here.
Which means all of us are looking forward to\npaying them back in high school just as much\nas you, too!
Right on!
Hmph. You act like you're the champs, but without\nTsubasa you're nothing.
You take that back!
It's high time you learned the taste of defeat.\nDon't worry, that time will come soon enough...\nOnce I take over the midfield!
Go ahead and try. But as long as I'm there,\nyou won't be doing squat!
Woohoo! We won!
Heh heh, my first win as captain...\nNot bad at all.
Man, and that was WITHOUT Tsubasa?!
That's what real teamwork looks like!
How long do you think we've been watching him\nplay? It's hard not to pick up a thing or two.
Our dirty little secret is that we're all\ntrying to become Tsubasa clones,\nand that's made us all better.
I see... So he's leading the whole team\nby example? I'll have to remember that.
Well, I'm sure you guys are under a lot of\npressure from being the reigning champs and all.\nGood luck in your next match.
Yeah, same to you.
...
What's the matter, Ishida?\nYou look kinda... happy?
Yeah. I learned a good lesson for next time.
We all get better by trying to be more like\nsomeone we look up to. If you think about it,\nisn't that what soccer's all about?
So if I can BE that someone for my teammates,\nthen I can really motivate them!
(Just you wait, Nankatsu...\nWe'll get you back for this in high school!)
Okay, we're done with practice for today!\nNice work, everyone!
Thank you, Captain!
Just make sure you keep it up tomorrow!
All right, it's time get some grub and shut eye!
Sounds good!
Huh? You're not heading back yet, Ishizaki?
Yeah. I'm gonna sneak in a little more practice.
Now that I'm captain,\nI can't afford to embarrass us in a match!
Now that you mention it, didn't you have to\nwork your butt off to pass the test to get\ninto Nankatsu to begin with?
What? You used to be bad?
So you've always\nbeen a hard worker!
Yup. I sucked all right.
I seem to remember you losing\nto Shutetsu thirty to nil.
Ha, yeah. But look how far I've come since then!\nCrazy, right?
No one can deny you've made insane progress.
Well, you're the only one who had to study for it.\nThe rest of the team forced special training on\nyou because they weren't sure you'd pass.
But I never gave up, and that's why I'm here!
But there's another reason I'm practicing late.
Yeah?
Do you remember what I said the night\nbefore the championship match?
That it was Tsubasa's last match with us, and\nthat I wished he could be in perfect condition?
Yeah, I remember that.
Well, I still mean it. I may have thought it was\nhis last match back then, but with this new\nleague he's got another shot.
I dunno when exactly he'll be healed up,\nbut I know he's definitely going to make\nit to the final match.
And that final match on the final\nday is gonna be between us and Toho.
There's no way they're going down before then, so\nno matter what happens, we have to keep winning,\ntoo.
That way, we can beat Toho with Tsubasa and send\nhim off to Brazil with an untarnished record.
I was never the greatest player. But after meeting\nTsubasa, I won the championship with Nankatsu SC.\nI won with Nankatsu MS THREE TIMES.
So now that it's all coming to an end,\nI want to finally return the favor.
Even if it's just an exhibition match, I want to\ngive him that final, perfect match against our\nfellow national champions.
That's why I'll do whatever\nit takes to get him to that pitch.
Ishizaki...
You're... really letting this whole\ncaptain thing go to your head, huh?
What was that?!
Tak! We're not gonna let\nyou act all cool by yourself!
You're not the only one who's benefitted\nfrom Tsubasa's leadership! We all have!
I still remember the shock I felt\nwhen I first played against him.
We were the champs in elementary school, but then\nhe slipped right past us. He even scored on\nWakabayashi, who had never conceded a goal before.
Seriously. We never saw him coming.
But ever since then, we've all been busting\nour butts just to keep up with him.\nThat's why we're here.
Definitely. Back in the elementary school\ntournament, I took a shot from Hyuga right on\nthe chin. I was so scared of the ball after that.
But Tsubasa told me "the ball is your friend. It's\nnot scary." He gave me the courage to stand up and\nface those shots again.
We all owe something to him. And we all want to\ndo for him what we can to show our gratitude.
So everyone is...
Let's all put in extra hours!
I'll work to repay\nTsubasa, too!
Tak!
Wait... that's my line!
Oh right. You've even been modeling\nsome of your moves on his, right?
I guess he already changed your life, too!
Anyway, let's get to it!
Tak!
Man, what a workout!
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.
Ha ha, same here!
Hey guys!
Tsubasa!
You were practicing this late?
I guess we got a little worked up...\nOut for a run, Tsubasa?
Yup! With the doctor's permission, of course!\nThey said a little light exercise would be fine.
That's great! One step closer to a full recovery!
Mind if I tag along?
I think I'll cool\noff with a run, too!
Huh?
After all that training?\nWhat rocket fuel are you running on?
You're still in the mood to run...?
What a guy.
Just don't overdo it, you two.
Watch yourselves out there!
Roger! You too!
Come on, let's go <avatar_name>!
Okay, let's take a short break here.
Maybe I overdid it a little...\nI was just so happy to get moving again.
Or maybe I'm just out of shape after my hiatus.
Remember not to\npush yourself.
You'll be back on\ntop in no time!
Yeah. Thanks.
I know. I just have to take it step by step.
I want to be in perfect shape for the tournament.
...
Do you have a dream, <avatar_name>?
To become a Nankatsu regular.
To get picked as a rep.
To be a pro soccer player.
To be the world's best.
Yeah, that's a good place to start.
You're surrounded by the best teammates you could\nask for though, so make sure you learn as much as\nyou can from them!
Well, do well enough here,\nand I'm sure you can achieve that.
You've got a lot of competition,\nbut don't let that get to you!
You too?
Well, I don't think any of us\nhaven't dreamt of that.
Ha ha! Aiming high, huh?
Actually... that's my dream, too.\nWhich I guess makes us rivals.
I'm not sure if you already know this,\nbut I'm moving to Brazil after graduation.
That's where Roberto Hongo lives,\nmy soccer mentor.
And that's where I'll go pro.
That's what I've been working toward this\nentire time, ever since elementary school.
So let's work together, <avatar_name>,\nto make both our dreams come true!
Wait, Tsubasa's not playing? What's the point\nthen? This won't even be a competition.
And ISHIZAKI's the captain? That sure brings\nback memories... of when you guys sucked.
H-Hey!
Izawa. Kisugi. Taki.
We've been training day in and out for\nthis chance, ever since the Shizuoka Regionals.
Today's the day the Otomo Quartet\ngets a complete shutout!
Yeah right, Urabe!
If you're the Otomo Quartet,\nthen we're the Shutetsu Quartet!
With the three of us on offense and Takasugi\non defense, there's no way we're losing to you!
You're not getting past me, Nitta!
By all means, do your worst!
Gah, we lost when they didn't even have Tsubasa!
I guess they didn't win three championships\nin a row just because of Tsubasa!
See that, Urabe? I'm not the same\nlittle kid I was in elementary school!
Geez, you don't have to rub your win in my face.
But I gotta admit, you're right.
And that Shutetsu Quartet of\nyours ain't half-bad either.
But this is just gonna make us go even harder off\nthe field, until we get to crush you on the field.
Urabe...
Don't forget: the tournament's not over, Ishizaki!\nDon't you dare lose to anyone else!
As if! But I hope you guys do well, too!
Captain.
What?
We'll have our chance to undo this humiliation.\nJust you wait!
Next year, we'll beat Nankatsu at the Regionals\nand take home the championship!
Nitta...
Yeah, if anyone's got the skill to pull it off,\nit's you. Stay strong and lead Otomo to greatness!
Racja!
(<avatar_name>... Where the heck did he come from?)
(The way he was able to bob and weave while\ndribbling... It was just like Tsubasa!)
(Next year's Regionals... I thought Otomo had\nit in the bag as long as they had Nitta,\nbut it's not gonna be that easy...)
(To be honest, I'm shocked. Never thought\nI'd be outplayed by a first-year.)
(But there's no way I'll lose next time!\nNext year is a whole new game!)
(Just you wait, <avatar_name>!\nI'll be seeing you in next year's Regionals!)
What? Tsubasa's not playing today?
Don't tell me he's still out of action\nfrom that injury at Nationals?
Nah, it's nothing that serious. He's just playing\nit safe and holding out for a full recovery.
Oh? Fair enough.
But do you really think you can\nstop our Skylab combo without him?
I guess this match is as good as ours!
You wish! You're never getting the ball past me!
That's right! Our defense is unmatched!
All right! We won!
Great job, guys! That makes two straight wins!
C'mon! We lost?!
They're this good, even without Tsubasa?!\nGuess we should've remembered that they did win\nthe championship three times running...
Heh. Lesson learned.
Well, you're only contributing a\nteensy little part of that, Ishizaki.
Wh-What?!
Tell Tsubasa to take care for us, okay?
I dunno if it'll be on the national team\nor in high school, but see ya soon!
Tak! Later!
But wow, I never would've expected\nIshizaki to be the acting captain.
I always took him for the kinda guy who'd let\nwinning go to his head, but he stayed fearless\nand true to himself.
No no no! What's the point of taking\na shot that completely misses the goal?!
Pay more attention to your position!\nYou would've gotten a clear shot\nif you'd just slipped the other way!
G-Got it!
But the defenders\nwere stellar!
Let's be more careful\nnext time, guys!
Yeah, if you look at it that way,\nthe defenders had some great positioning.
Keep it up, defense!
Racja!
Tak!
Good attitude! If you have time to feel bad,\nyou have time to fix your mistakes!
Everyone's really into it today.
Yeah. Especially <avatar_name>.\nIt's like he's crushed out all his jitters\nafter only two matches.
He's not self-centered, either.\nHe's paying attention to the others,\nand isn't afraid to speak up and help them out.
Nankatsu will need people like him next year.
Hey! Third years!\nAre we gonna let these young'uns show us up?!
No way!
Phew, worked up a good sweat today!
See ya later, <avatar_name>!
Done already?
Nice work today!
I mean, I'd love to continue, but I've got high\nschool entrance exams to think about.
Yeah, we were gonna have a\ngroup study session tonight.
See you tomorrow!
Alright, time to crack those books\nand get some studying in while we can!
Hey Ishizaki, you can join us if you like.
Me? Well, hmm...
Please train with me, Captain!
It's important to study.
How could I say no to that?
Sorry Taki, but I'm gonna\nstay behind and keep practicing.
Hmm...
Nah, I think this is even more important.\nI'll stay behind and keep practicing!
You sure? Well, okay...
Good luck, you two!
Okay, let's get back to it!
Heh, you're getting pretty good.\nBut you can still do better!
All right, I'm calling it for today!
Oh yeah, you thirsty? I could buy you a sports\ndrink or something. Gotta get those electrolytes!
Man, there's nothing like\na cold drink after practice!
But seriously, you've really surprised me.
Our club gets plenty of people who join because of\nTsubasa, but most them call it quits after seeing\nhow hard we work.
But you're different. The standard drills for\nregulars is tough on its own, but you're staying\nafter to do more. I'm impressed.
Oops...
Hey Tsubasa. Out for a late night run?
Y-Yeah! I just felt a little antsy sitting still.
What about you two? Staying late after practice?
You know it! <avatar_name> here was so\ninto it that I felt obliged to stick around\nand keep him company.
So anyway, you got permission from\nyour doctor to start training then?
N-Not yet...
Oh, huh.
Well, um, better get back to my jog! See ya!
...
How do you feel about waking up early tomorrow,\n<avatar_name>?
Wanna get some training in at, say, five-ish?
Five in the morning?!
Absolutely!
Yeah, I know it's early.
But I think it'll do you some real good.
Ha! I knew you were crazy!
You really are just like him.
Alright then, see ya tomorrow!\nDon't forget: five in the AM.
5:00 the next morning--
Mornin'! Did you sleep well? Eat breakfast?
Cause if you're ready, let's get to warming up!
Alright, my body's pretty loose now.
Any minute now...
Hey, Tsubasa!
I-Ishizaki?!
Why are you up so early?
Wait, was this\nall a trap then?
Um, well...
Let me guess, after getting a taste of exercise,\nyou couldn't resist the urge to dive all the way\nback in?
Yup. That's why I wanted to be here at five.
Let me guess, after getting a taste of exercise,\nyou couldn't resist the urge to dive all the way\nback in?
Huh? How did you--
It was written all over your face last night.\nAnd I know how you think by now.
You don't have permission from your doctor,\nbut you didn't want to lie to us either,\nso you'd come by when no one's around. Right?
Ugh...
We used to practice this early back in\nelementary school too, didn't we?\nSo I figured I just had to wait.
...
Sorry. I just couldn't take it anymore.
...
Let's train together then.
You mean it...?
Like you'd listen if I told you not to play?\nWe both know that's a lie. But we can't\nhave you going overboard either.
So what we're gonna do is keep an eye on you\nand make sure you take enough breaks!
Thank you, man!
What're friends for?
Anyway, let's get started already!\nTime's a wasting!
Awesome!
Okay, one last round. It's almost time\nfor everyone else to start showing up.
Here I come, <avatar_name>!
And we're done!
Gah! Why can't\nI stop you?!
T-Teach me how to\ndo that feint!
You'll never stop me if you only focus\non what's right in front of you.
You have to be thinking two or three steps ahead.\nBoth on offense and defense.
You're really a sponge, aren't ya?\nPicking up everyone else's moves... Just like me.
But sorry, we don't have time for that today.\nI'll teach you later.
Anyway, we'd better hurry up and clear the field!
Racja!
Thanks, you two.
Seriously though, how're you feeling?
Actually, I start my real rehab today.
And it won't be just to get back to how I was.\nThey recommend strengthening my ankles and\nshoulders, so I won't have a repeat injury.
It's supposed to be a way harder\nprogram than what's standard, though.
I see...
I'm sure you'll be fine. Good luck!
Yeah, you too!
Later!
You're a kind person, Captain.
You make a great captain.
What can I say?
Y-You think?
I mean, I really should be mad at him for doing\nsecret training against his doctor's orders.
But I can't exactly keep him on a leash, either.
Cutting him some slack is gonna\nhelp in the long run, I think.
Or something like that.
Everyone needs\nunique guidance?
...Is that the only reason?
Yeah, exactly! You can think of it like that, too.
You're one sharp dude.
To be honest, he's my friend so I\nwanted to help him. That's all, really.
I know giving one player special treatment means\nI'm probably not doing my best as a captain,\nbut... it's complicated.
Oh yeah, and we had another reason\nto practice with him this morning.
It was for you, too. I wanted you\nto have a chance to work with him.
I've been practicing with him for years, but\nreally, practice was only ever fun because he\nwas there. He's the reason I've come so far.
But you've never really had the chance to play\nwith him, so I figured it'd be a good experience.
Oh, hey! Morning you two!
Wow, you're here early. What's the occasion?
Why wouldn't we be here already?\nWe're warmed up and ready to go!
Oh, cool. Then the rest of us\nwill get loose and join you!
Let's do it!
Okay, practice is over for today!
Thank you, Captain!
Anyone who wants to take part in a\npractice match should stay behind!
Hey, isn't that...? Heeey! Tsubasa!
Hey guys. Did you just finish practice?
Yeah. On your way home from rehab?
Yup.
You look exhausted. Is it really that hard?
Yeah, it's pretty tough.
But it's harder not being able to play soccer.
Anyway, my language tutor's coming over,\nso I gotta go. Later!
It must be pretty rough going\nif even Tsubasa thinks it's tough.
But it's all so he can get back in the game.\nHe never quits.
How can he work so hard?
So that's how he feels...
Once he has a goal, he doesn't back down.
Yup. That's Tsubasa Ozora in a nutshell.
I'm sure you were watching, but back at Nationals\nwe were only able to push ourselves as hard as we\ndid because a third win was our shared dream.
Tsubasa can be a little harsh at times...
But he puts his money where his mouth is. He'll do\nanything to make his dreams come true.
Also, I heard from Sanaé that when he stepped out\ndue to injury during the match with Toho, they had\nalready told him to switch out.
But he refused, and kept on playing. You'd never\nhave known he was hurt by lookin' at him.
Maybe that looks like a dumb decision from the\noutside, but putting everything on the line to\nachieve a goal is who Tsubasa is.
And that's how he's managed to lead us this far.\nDon't let anyone tell you otherwise.
It's not just about winning or losing either.\nIt's about his love of soccer.
He hates losing to anyone\nin the game he loves so much.
We've been with him long enough\nto get how he feels.
I mean, he almost killed himself out there\nto fulfill our dream of winning our third\nchampionship.
And now, there's no one left\nto fulfill our dreams but ourselves.
Which is why we can't let up now!\nFor Tsubasa and for ourselves!
Tak!
What? No Tsubasa?
Man, why did I even show up today?\nWho needs an Ace Killer when there's no aces?
We'll make you eat those words!
Tak! We can take you with or without Tsubasa!
We've got at least three aces\nto take you down with, Soda!
Heh. At least you aren't cowards.
Fine, bring it on!\nI'll mow you all down with my Razor Tackle!
Woohoo, we did it! That's three in a row!
How'd you like that, Soda?!
Tsubasa isn't Nankatsu's only trump card!
Fine... you got me good.\nYou guys are all solid players.
I can't believe I misjudged you so poorly. I'll be\nkeeping my eyes open a little wider from now on.
Anyone that says "they'll never win without\nTsubasa" is in for a rude awakening.
Can't disagree there.
But it's more than that. Feels like you're\ncookin' with more than you had back at Nationals.
Isn't that right, Ishizaki?
You noticed? You've got a sharp eye.
Anyway, good luck down the road!
Also, tell Tsubasa I'll see him on the rep team!
I betcha think I ain't interested\nin a match without Tsubasa.
You'd be wrong.
Kisugi! Taki! You guys showed us up back at\nNationals, but today there's going to be a\nreckoning!
I hope you're ready for some pain\ncuz we're all outta mercy!
You stole the words right out of my mouth!\nYou're gonna wish you never faced us!
We'll blast past you with our\nteamwork just like last time!
You're not the only ones who\nknow how to work together.
Hope you're ready to lose some points!
We've seen through your tricks already!\nThis'll be a shutout!
Gah! What is this?
I didn't think they'd be\nthis good without Tsubasa!
See that, Jito?!\nThat's the might of Nankatsu's forwards!
You guys may have gotten better,\nbut we weren't slacking off either!
...Yeah, I see that.\nSomethin' different 'bout y'all today.\nYa got more fire than ya did at Nationals.
You've got quite the eye.
A fighter always trusts his gut.
Anyway, try to keep it up\nfor the rest of your matches!
Tell Tsubasa I'll be waitin'\nfor him on the All-Japan team!
...
(Everyone's trying so hard down there,\nand all I can do is watch from the stands.)
(The doctor even told me my rehab\nmay not finish in time for finals.)
(I can't let things stay like this!\nI have to do something!)
(A call from... Mr. Katagiri?)
Yes? Hello?
Hey there, Tsubasa. I wanted to check\nin on your rehab. Making progress?
Yes, Sir. From what I can tell,\nI'm almost as good as new.
But they told me that I should strengthen\nmy muscles, so I don't reinjure myself,\nand that it's still too early to play...
Actually, that's what I wanted\nto talk to you about.
...
Huh?
Hmm, you two were both a little half-baked back\nthere. Whether it's charging in or putting on the\nbreaks, you've gotta commit.
Ha ha... Harsh.
Oops, it's already this late?
Okay, morning practice is over! Time to clean up!
Roger that.
Hey, <avatar_name>, are you getting enough rest?\nYou were lookin' a bit sloppy just now.
I-I'm perfectly fine!
What about you, Ishizaki?
Well, if you say so.
Hey, who do you think I am?\nLike that'd ever be enough to wear me out!
Hey, can we talk you two?
Sure, what is it?
I'm thinking about leaving the team for a bit.
Wha...?
The other day, Mr. Katagiri told me about a\nstate-of-the-art rehab facility in Tokyo.
I hear it's got a serious regimen,\nbut I was thinking of trying it out.
Something wrong with what you're doing now?
Yeah, it's too slow. At this rate, I won't be able\nto play in the tournament.
But with that new place,\nmaybe I'd make it in time.
Watching those last three games\nfrom the stands was pure torture.
I feel so helpless. Like there has to be something\nmore I could be doing. And if I can recover even\none day sooner...!
The whole team's been killing themselves in\npractice, while I just sit there by myself.\nNot even on the field. It's agonizing.
...
I understand. Go if you have to, Tsubasa.
Don't worry about us, we're all just\nwaiting for you to come back anyway.
We can handle this!
Thanks, Ishizaki.
And you too, <avatar_name>.\nTake care of them while I'm gone.
I'll work just as hard as you!
I'll cover while you're gone!
<avatar_name>...
Not a bad goal!
<avatar_name>...
Those are some big shoes to fill, you know.
Yeah, but I know you can do it!
(Okay, now it's my turn! I know I can handle\nwhatever this rehab center's got in store for me!)
(And then I'll be back in time\nfor the tournament!)
So Tsubasa's going to Tokyo...?
Listen guys! He wants to get healed up as soon\nas possible, and if that means he has to leave,\nhe has to leave!
Which means WE need to keep winning so he doesn't\ncome back and hafta bail us out right away!
Obviously!
Good luck with rehab, Tsubasa!
Everyone stay strong!
Okay guys, we're gonna make Tsubasa proud, right?\nWe're going all out today!
Tak!
Keep it up! Keep it up!
Alright, that's enough running!\nNext up is drills, so do what you need to!
Zróbmy to!
(Phew...)
What's wrong, Ishizaki?
N-Nothing. Just a little thirsty.
Y-Yeah, I'm gonna go get some water!\nGotta stay hydrated!
...
Here it comes, Kisugi!
Gah!
Now it's my turn!
What? I can't shake 'em!
Got it!
What...? You stopped it?!
You're getting sloppy, <avatar_name>!\nPay attention to your form!
Looks like everyone's feeling tired today.
Well, you know...
Nationals was rough, sure,\nbut this is a different kind of challenge.
Without Tsubasa around,\neveryone else is getting marked more.
The Otomo Quartet really gave us a fight.
Every other team here wants\nto stop our win streak.
And in that last match, getting marked\nby Soda was like a death sentence.
I mean, they don't call him\nthe Ace Killer for nothing.
And in that last match, I thought I was prepared\nfor Jito's ferocity, but he's turned it up a notch\nsince Nationals.
He probably went easy on us last time\nto save his strength for Tsubasa.
Has Tsubasa had to face off against\npeople like that this whole time?
So our next match is... Furano MS, which means\nMatsuyama. And after that is Misugi and Musashi\nMS. This isn't gonna get any easier.
Can we win without Tsubasa?
He would never stand\nfor such a comment!
Have you learned\nnothing from him?!
<avatar_name>...
<avatar_name>...
He's right!
Tsubasa was dealing with those defenses\nall on his own, and look what he did!
So how can we whine about it when there are\nthree of us to split the burden? It's pathetic!
Izawa. Kisugi. Taki.
We call ourselves the Shutetsu Quartet,\nbut do you remember why we went to Nankatsu MS?
That's right...!
You're right. We've gotten soft.
We joined Nankatsu so we could play on Tsubasa's\nside for once, and maybe a little of his skill\nwould rub off on us.
If we're gonna give up at the first sign of trouble,\nhow can we ever show our faces to Wakabayashi again?\nHe recommended us, remember?
Thanks you guys. For reminding us what matters.
Ishizaki's right! If Tsubasa could handle\nit alone, there's no way we can't handle\nit with three of us!
Besides, if we get good enough by the time Tsubasa\ngets back, we'll be able to really help him out by\nthe time he gets back.
Alright, no more moaning! We'll handle the front\nlines, and we look to the rest of you for support!
Tak!
Tak! That's the spirit! Okay, this'll be our last\npractice match so let's really push ourselves!
Tak!
Ishizaki and <avatar_name> sure are energetic, huh?
They're just pushing themselves too hard.
Huh?
You can tell that they're both exhausted.\nTheir movement today has been sloppier than ever.
<avatar_name>'s been training with the younger kids\nuntil just recently, when he was suddenly jumped\nup to training with the regulars.
So every single day he's been training harder than\nhe's ever trained before, on top of staying late\nfor extra training, ON TOP OF the actual matches.
As for Ishizaki, after being made captain of the\nbest team in Japan, he's feeling the pressure to\nkeep winning, while also having to lead the team.
When you put it like that... When you're just a\nregular player all you need to do is go out and\nplay hard, and that's that.
But as captain, you've gotta be responsible\nfor everything, including the outcome.
Yup. And now they're both putting on a brave face\nfor the team and trying to hide the fact that they\ncan barely move.
In other words, pushing themselves too hard.
Well, Ishizaki's got the stamina for it,\nso maybe it'll work out in his case.
It's <avatar_name> I'm worried about.
I see... So Tsubasa won't be playing...
Yeah. He's in the middle of his rehab.
Well, knowing him there's no way he'd turn down\na good game, so I'm sure it's important.
But don't expect us to let our\nguard down just because of that.
...
I'm sure you guys are each giving it 120%\nto fill the hole he left in the lineup.
And Furano MS knows better than anyone how\nincredible a team can be when they play as one.
Ha. Saw right through us then?
This is bigger than just a normal game. This is a\nshowdown between you and me, Captain Ishizaki!
Wouldn't have it any other way!
I accept your challenge, Captain Matsuyama!
We won! We beat Furano!
We did it, Ishizaki!
That makes four wins!
Guess you've got the right stuff after all!
Thanks, guys!
Congrats, Ishizaki. It's our loss.
But I have to say, even I'm surprised how well\nyou pulled Nankatsu together without Tsubasa.
Ha ha ha... Well, I used to be captain\nback in elementary school, too.
But I can't take any credit for myself.
It's like you said before the match,\nit's precisely because Tsubasa's not here.
Huh?
As three-peat National champs, we've got our\npride, too. How could we lose just because we\ndon't have Tsubasa?
Besides, we want him to be able to come back with\nperfect health, stand on this field one last time,\nand head off to Brazil with a perfect win record.
Those feelings are what pulled the team together,\nnot me.
I see... Makes sense.
Heck, I can't wait to see him\nback on the field, myself.
Anyway, good luck with your last two matches!
Yeah, you too!
(But even with the whole team fighting for the\nsame thing, sometimes that can turn into\nrecklessness, like Oda in the Minamiuwa match.)
(It's the job of the captain\nto take that energy and focus it.)
(But from what I saw of you today,\nyou seem like the man for the job, Ishizaki.)
Phew...
You look pretty tired, Ishizaki.
Why-Why would you say that?\nI'm as healthy as a horse!
You don't need to hide it.\nWe all know how rough you've got it.
Taking Tsubasa's place as captain,\ntraining from dawn to dusk,\nand busting your butt in the games...
You'd have to be superhuman\nnot to be tired after all that.
Morisaki...
You're not looking so hot either, <avatar_name>.\nYou okay?
I-I'm fine...
Maybe a little tired...
H-Hey! <avatar_name>!
H-Hey! <avatar_name>!
Oh good, you're awake. We were worried.
The doctor said the issue was pushing\nyourself so hard in this heat.
You've been putting everything into both practice\nand the matches, which is good, but you hafta give\nyourself some room to breathe, too.
Don't worry, I'm fine!
I don't have time to rest!
<avatar_name>...
<avatar_name>...
(Wait, don't tell me...)
And you too, <avatar_name>.\nTake care of them while I'm gone.
(Did he take Tsubasa's words that seriously?)
(Does he really think he has to replace Tsubasa?)
(Don't tell this is him trying\nto do what Tsubasa asked...)
...
No. I won't allow it. You're not Tsubasa.
Ishizaki...
You're taking a break from practice starting\ntomorrow, and you're staying off the pitch\nuntil you've recovered.
Got it?
Okay, let's clean up and go home.\nI'll pick up your stuff for you, <avatar_name>.
That night--
How can I catch up to\nTsubasa like this?!
How can I surpass\nTsubasa like this?!
He really had a lot of fatigue built up, eh?
Ow ow ow...
Something happen to your ankle, Taki?
Yeah, last match. Don't worry though,\nit'll be fine.
We've all got those little injuries.\nWe're all a bit ragged in one way or another.
So all that's left are Musashi and Toho...
With Hyuga back, Toho's been\nbreezing past the competition.
Yup. I only saw the footage, but it looks like\nthey're better than ever and more confident, too.
I'm sure splitting the championship title\nwith us at Nationals is a big part of that.
Musashi hasn't been slacking off either.\nEspecially that Misugi. His form is impeccable.
Yeah, it seemed like he's only gotten\nbetter since the Tokyo Regionals.
And not just him... The rest of the team is\nplaying looks like they're really making up\nfor missing out on Nationals.
So next up is Musashi MS, huh?
Back when we played Musashi FC in elementary\nschool, Misugi beat us practically on his own.
If we can't pin him down somehow,\nthis'll be rough.
Speaking of which, have you heard\nanything from Tsubasa, Ishizaki?
Nope. Nothing.
Oh... I hope his rehab is going okay.
I'm sure he's fine.\nHe's probably just focused on getting better.
I believe in him.
Ishizaki...
<avatar_name>!
Wh-Why are you here?! I told you to take a break!
I wanna be like Tsubasa!
I dream of going pro!
<avatar_name>...
<avatar_name>...
(He's aiming high!)
(You really do mean to reach Tsubasa's level...)
(You really are serious\nabout outclassing Tsubasa...)
(You are insanely dedicated...)
There are still matches to be played.\nDon't burn yourself out here.
That's right. If you overdo it, you might injure\nyourself and be out for the whole tournament.
I really don't stand a chance.
Huh?
You got me beat, <avatar_name>.
It's that fire and tenacity that landed\nyou a spot on the starting lineup.
Okay! As captain, I recognize your resolve\nand will support your decision!
Thank you!
I'll take responsibility\nfor whatever happens.
Don't worry about it!
(You two really are alike...)
You really remind me of him.
If you intend to practice,\nthen go get changed already!
You sure about this, Ishizaki?
Seeing <avatar_name> like this reminds\nme of Tsubasa during Nationals.
Who am I to stand in his way?
He really does give off the same aura\nI felt from Tsubasa.
They're cut from the same cloth.\nOnce they know what they want...
As veterans, we ought to support\nhim while he can still stand.
Tak! Sure thing!
We can't let that greenhorn outrun us!\nLet's show him what we're made of!
Follow my lead, team! We've got dreams of our own,\nso let's work to fulfill them!
Tak!
Just two more matches...
The only thing we need to worry about is winning.
Hey, isn't that...
Hey guys!
Tsubasa!
Sorry I've been out of touch.\nI was focusing on my rehab.
I knew it! You've always got the blinders\non when your on a mission.
So how's that rehab going?
The regimen's tough, but my ankle and shoulder\nhave gotten stronger, so it's working.
The doctor said if I keep it up,\nI could even play in the finals!
That's great news!
I know you guys are up against Musashi MS and\nMisugi today. It won't be easy, but I know you'll\nhold your own!
I'll stop Misugi\nin his tracks!
We'll stop him as a team!
Misugi is really skilled.
When I first played against him, I became\nincredibly discouraged because he outclassed\nme in so many ways.
But everyone helped me get back on my feet,\nand we even pulled out a win.
<avatar_name>. Your confidence will play a key role\nin this match, so be sure to hold onto it while\nfacing this challenge with the team!
Teamwork is what we're all about.
When I first played against him, I became\nincredibly discouraged because he outclassed\nme in so many ways.
But everyone helped me get back on my feet,\nand we even pulled out a win.
<avatar_name>, you've got to work together\nto beat the opponent!
I'll be fighting alongside you all\nin spirit from the sidelines.
I'm counting on you guys today!
Tak!
If we win today's match, we'll be going\ninto the finals with no losses.
It's time to make the magic happen,\nno matter what it takes!
Tak!
So Tsubasa won't be playing today?\nI was looking forward to a showdown...
It's a bummer, but I don't think Tsubasa's\nany happier about it than you are.
I bet...
...
Well, it does me no good to mope about it.\nTime to turn it up and help my team win this game.
I've got another dream. I want to don the uniform\nof the Japanese national team, and that means\nraining down the fury on you guys.
I hope you're ready for us, Ishizaki.
Bring. It. On.
You're not the only one with aspirations. A\nvictory today is just another step on our journey!
W-We did it! We won!
How awesome is this!
We won the game!
Next up is Toho Academy in the finals,\nalso undefeated.
Today just wasn't our day.
Pardon my bluntness, but I didn't think Nankatsu\nwould be this strong without Tsubasa.
Guess I've still got stuff to learn.\nSoccer never ceases to surprise me.
You say that, but no one's gonna deny you got\nskills. I can't tell you how nervous I was every\ntime you got the ball.
I can almost guarantee you'll be a Japan rep.
I certainly hope so!
Good luck in the finals.
Thanks!
We've finally made it.
Tak! We got to Toho without\ngiving up a single game!
But this ain't over yet!
It's too early to rejoice.
<avatar_name>'s right.
<avatar_name>'s right.
We still have to beat Toho\nbefore our dream is realized!
We were in so many tight spots during Nationals,\nbut Tsubasa always saved us with key plays.
Now, it's our turn to give Tsubasa a helping hand!
The stage is set.\nLet's win this thing together with Tsubasa!
Tsubasa helped us become champs.\nIt's our turn to return the favor!
Let's send Tsubasa off to Brazil with a flawless\nrecord. We're just one game away! Zróbmy to!
Tak!
(They're doing so much for me...)
...
Tsubasa.
Misugi!
I'm sorry I couldn't play today.
Katagiri told me everything over the phone.\nYou've got to be tip top if you're representing\nthe country, so I understand.
I just consider myself unlucky.
I watched all your matches from the stands,\nand I've gotta say...\nYou really are an incredible player, Misugi.
Heh.
You know I love soccer, but I never thought it'd\nbe this soul crushing not being able to play.
I don't know how you did it for two years\nwhile getting treated for your heart.
You constantly amaze me.\nI don't think I could stand it...
Tsubasa...
It was my love for soccer\nthat helped me get through it.
Oh!
One of my dreams was to play against you again.\nSo, I'll continue treating this disease while\nplaying soccer.
If I keep playing,\nI just know I'll be able to do that one day.
Misugi...
You know, Nankatsu was rather formidable today.
I was under the impression that your leadership\nwas what carried your team through Nationals, but\neach player played a key role in today's match.
Yeah. Everyone really did their part.
Anyone would be lucky to\nhave such great teammates.
Hey, Tsubasa! There you are!
Ishizaki.
We're headed back to Nankatsu.\nWhat're you gonna do?
I'm going to stop by rehab.\nI'll head back tomorrow.
I should be good to practice\nthe day after tomorrow!
Really? I can't wait to see you back on the pitch!
All right then. See you in two days!
(I led everyone this year to win Nationals,\nmaking us three-time champions.)
(But the only reason that dream came true is\nbecause everyone was there for me. We went\nundefeated for all three years of junior high.)
(If they're doing all this for me, then\nI owe it to them to helps us realize our\nhopes and dreams together!)
Two days after the Musashi MS match--
Zróbmy to! Izawa, Taki, Kisugi!
Tak!
Not gonna happen!
We've got to stop them!
What?!
Oh no!
Kisugi!
Take this!
Nice one, Morisaki... Huh?!
All the way, <avatar_name>!
Nice shot!
Here we go!
Nice pass, <avatar_name>!
They got me!
I'm not going to let it end so one sided.\nAgain, Tsubasa!
Sure! Let's go, everybody!
Tak!
The way he's playing, it seems Tsubasa\nreally is back up to full speed.
Yeah. He's fighting fit.
That's what makes this practice\nall the more worth doing.
C'mon, guys! We'll stop Tsubasa next time!
Tak!
Your rehab really paid off!
In fact, you're even stronger\nthan you were before.
I think so, too.\nBut you know, I was a bit afraid to play again.
It seems I can move even better than I thought.\nIt really was worth the wait.
But I'm floored how much work you put in while\nI was away! I'm barely keeping up!
We've been pushing the edges of what we thought\nwe could do. We had to win, no matter what!
We've been through a lot, but you were\nthe one that led us here, Ishizaki.
I did? Aw, shucks.
To be honest, I was a bit worried at first.\nI mean, Ishizaki as the captain...
What'd you say? I was the captain\nof the Nankatsu elementary team!
You mean back when the team wasn't good yet.
Nobody's asking you!
Let's get back to it! One more run!
Tak!
We've been through a lot, but you were the ones\nthat led us here, Ishizaki, <avatar_name>.
I just did what I could. It wasn't a big deal.
I think <avatar_name> had a much\nbigger impact on the team.
<avatar_name>?
Yeah.
He inspired Izawa when he was down,\npracticed beyond the brink of exhaustion...\nHe worked really hard for the team.
I see.
When he made first string,\nthe first thing out of his mouth was,\n"I'll try to be as good as you, Tsubasa!"
He really stepped up while you were gone.
When he made first string, the first thing out of\nhis mouth was, "I'll be even better than Tsubasa!"
That's probably where he gets it from.\nHe's leading us just like you would.
When he made first string,\nI didn't expect much out of him.
But he's really led us just like you would.
(I didn't know <avatar_name> had such\nan impressive effect on the team...)
The next morning--
(Yesterday's practice proved I've still\ngot my moves and my body is keeping up.\nBut my soccer sense is a bit off.)
(I've got to keep practicing and get it back.)
Good morning, <avatar_name>! I knew you'd come.
Is Ishizaki not with you?
Is there something I can help you with?
I want to test my limits!
I want a face off, Tsubasa!
...
Okay.
A challenge, huh...
I guess we'd never really have the\nchance being teammates and all.
Then let me see how strong you've\nbecome during this tournament.
I hope you're ready!
Looks like I win. It was a good match, though.
Your technique, your heart, and most of all...
Your passion and dedication to pursuing\nyour goals... I could feel it in my legs.
I now understand why everyone\nhas so much faith in you.
You're all here... What's going on?
Well, I sorta mentioned you practice in the early\nmorning, and everyone just decided to come.
That's not fair, holding secret\npractice without us!
We won't have many more chances\nto play with you, you know.
The more we can play together,\nthe more we can grow.
I brought all the sports drink we'll need,\nso don't run out of steam!
Come on! Let's get ready and practice!
Tak!
Oh, you guys...
(Nankatsu... We really are a great team.)
(I'm grateful to have such\nwonderful teammates to play with.)
All right! Let's really do this guys!
Tak!
It's finally the big day. We're up against Toho\nAcademy for that undefeated tournament record.
We've worked so hard to get here!\nTime to go hard and wrap up our legacy!
Tak!
Tsubasa, are you at 100%?
You bet. I'm itching to play!
That's good to hear.
There's one more thing I need to take care of.
I think this is yours, Tsubasa.
You're giving me the captain's armband?
It's yours.
You're the team captain today, Tsubasa.
But you're the one that led the team\nall the way to the tournament finals!
And I'm only playing in this one match.\nI shouldn't--
Today is our last official match as Nankatsu MS.
I really want you to be the captain today.
And I'm not the only one of that opinion.\nThe entire team agrees.
He's right, you know.
If you're here, you've gotta be captain.
The band's back together! Now let's make music!
You're everyone's role model, Tsubasa.\nThe younger players look up to you, too.
Show the future of Nankatsu MS how we play!
Alright Tsubasa, it's time for\nthe captain to rally the troops!
Show <avatar_name> how it's done!
You guys flatter me...
...
Thank you. Then I'll gladly be your captain today.
That armband really looks good on you.
Come on Captain, let's get a few words.
Oh, sure.
Um...
Toho is in the same position as us... We're both\ntrying to win this tournament with no losses.
It may just be an exhibition, but we're in the\nsame position as we were during Nationals.
The only reason Nankatsu can finish off the season\non such a big stage is thanks to all of you.
I won't accept anything but a win!\nLet's go out with a bang!
Tak!
How about it, <avatar_name>.\nWanna say a few words, too?
Let's make our\ndream come true!
I'll try not to fall behind!
I'll hunt that tiger down!
Tak! Let's fulfill that dream of ours!
Don't worry about that!\nJust play like you always do!
So you plan to take on Hyuga, huh?
It's not gonna be easy,\nbut give it all you've got.
Let's get to the field, everyone!
Tak!
Under this azure summer sky,\nthe day has finally come.
The final match of the recently-established\nJunior Hero League soccer tournament.\nToho Academy vs. Nankatsu MS!
The teams won their brackets at the Junior\nNationals tournament. Now we bring\nthem together for a final showdown!
Nankatsu's captain Tsubasa Ozora was injured at\nNationals, but now looks to have returned fighting\nfit in his first match of this tournament.
We're all looking forward to seeing\nTsubasa play in top form.
And what's more, Nankatsu is joined by a wild card\nfirst-year player, who has played a key role in\nthe team's success in this league!
Today, Nankatsu face the prestigious Toho\nAcademy, which has been victorious in the middle\nschool, high school, and university soccer levels.
It's their best lineup yet,\nled by their ace Kojiro Hyuga.
Both of these teams have made it to this\nfinal match with a perfect win streak!
Now, this isn't just any exhibition!\nThe winners will be the top team in the league!\nThese are the League Finals!
It's almost time for the starting whistle, folks!
Tsubasa! I couldn't ask for more!
As I said during the National finals,\nI want to face the best.
I'm glad my wish was granted so soon.
That goes for me, too, Hyuga. I won't hold back!
You do that! Play your best,\nbut this day is our day!
(Not so fast, Hyuga.)
(I know what I want...\nAnd I know what I owe my team.)
(I'm here to make sure they're given their due!)
Listen up, team!\nWe're pulling out all the stops today!
Tak!
Nankatsu MS, the three-time reigning champions,\nmaintains a perfect record and takes home the\nJunior Hero League championship title!
Graaah!
Not again...!
W-We did it, Tsubasa!
Ishizaki!
We won every game!
We hit a few rough patches along the way,\nbut we actually made it!
We really did it!\nThis is unreal.
Did you expect anything less?
Are you guys... crying?
No way, man.
Unreal as it may be... We made it happen.
You're trying to act all cool,\nbut I see you grinning from ear to ear!
When you've got something to celebrate,\nyou don't need to hold anything back!
I'm not crying! My eyes are just sweaty!
Looks like you've got something in your eye, too!
Ishizaki.
Wakashimazu.
I know how much pressure there is to fill\nin as captain and bring a team together.
But you mustered up the strength to do it.\nYou'll be a tough opponent come high school.
Tak! I'll see you on the pitch in high school!
Tsubasa.
Hyuga.
You guys seem different from\nwhen we played during Nationals.
I can't quite put my finger on it...\nIs there something in the water where you live?
Heh, something like that. Every one of them\nis an irreplaceable friend and teammate.
I see. I'm starting to understand\nwhy you guys are so strong.
And playing against you today confirmed it.
There's only one player that I've\npaid attention to since elementary school.\nThat's you, Tsubasa Ozora!
You're the only one that stirs up\nthis fighting spirit of mine.
...
Hyuga... I felt the same way after today's match.
Huh?
Kojiro Hyuga... You're the only one I lost to in\nelementary. And you're the only one that could\nhold your own with me during middle school.
It's clear to me now. You have been my greatest\nrival and the strongest player I've come up\nagainst.
Ha! I thought you wanted\nto play against Misaki the most.
Misaki and I make a great duo, and it's true\nI hope to play against him someday.
But Nankatsu's greatest obstacle to achieving\nthree championships was none other than Toho\nAcademy, led by you. We always met in the finals.
You always rose to challenge me in the finals,\nand I was always able to give it my best with\nno regrets.
If you didn't hit me with your shot back then, I\ndon't think I would've had the heart to continue.
Tsubasa...
...
That's all in the past, now.
My goal isn't to reach your level anymore.\nI've got my own goal I'm working toward now.
I know.
As you continue down your path,\nI know someday we'll run into each other again.\nI look forward to that day.
That goes for me as well.\nI'll be ready for you next time.
For that reason, I will be the star of high\nschool soccer and bring new life to\nthe Japanese soccer scene!
You'd better do the same in Brazil, Tsubasa!
I will! You better keep your end of the deal!
But before that, I guess we have this\ninternational tournament to worry about.
Oh yeah.
We're forming a team of everyone we've played\nagainst and going up against the world.
Let's show the world what we can do, Hyuga!
You got it!
(I just couldn't stop them from scoring goals.\nMisugi, Tsubasa, now that first year... Could\na kid that young already play like a captain?!)
(Nah, it must just be a fluke...\nExcept, no... Maybe not...)
(I'm sure that <avatar_name> will be on the\nteam representing Japan. I'd bet my life on it.)
(I know true talent when I see it.)
(I'm quite confident in my passes, but\n<avatar_name>... He might just be better than me.)
(This is no time to be in awe! We're the same\nyear, so we'll be playing against each other\nnext year and the year after that!)
(I'll take up Hyuga's mantle, and carry\nTeam Toho into the future! I'll bring home\nevery championship I can!)
(And next time, I'll take home the cup!)
Thanks to all teams who participated\nin this exhibition tournament!\nThe Junior Hero League is now over.
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up\nfor the MVP of this tournament: the newcomer\nfrom Nankatsu, <avatar_name>!
He shot through this league like a comet!\nHe is truly the "Junior Hero!"
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up\nfor the MVP of this tournament: the newcomer\nfrom Nankatsu, <avatar_name>!
Not only that, he's also the top scorer of the\ntournament. It's a miraculous double crown, folks!
He shot through this league like a comet!\nHe is truly the "Junior Hero!"
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up\nfor the MVP of this tournament:\nRyo Ishizaki from Nankatsu!
Taking the place of the one-and-only Captain\nTsubasa is no easy feat, but Ishizaki stepped up\nto the task and led his team to victory!
And the top-scoring player of the tournament\nis the newcomer from Nankatsu, <avatar_name>!
He earned recognition by sweeping past strikers,\nwhich is all the more impressive!
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up\nfor the MVP of this tournament:\nRyo Ishizaki from Nankatsu!
His gutsy play style speaks for itself,\nbut he's done a marvelous job as captain, as well!
We would like to recognize twenty-one\nincredible players from the Junior Hero League!
From Nankatsu MS: Izawa, Ishizaki, Kisugi,\nTakasugi, Taki, Morisaki, <avatar_name>...
And though he only appeared in the game against\nToho, the boy who led his team to victory\nat Nationals, Tsubasa Ozora!
These twenty-one players will travel to\nthe United States to represent Japan\nin international competition.
Watch out! This new generation of players\nwill show the world what Japan can do!
It's finally over...
Tak! And boy did we end it on a high.
Thank you, Tsubasa.
Hmm?
Our middle school soccer career\nwas awesome thanks to you.
The only reason we remained undefeated\nwas what you did for the team.
There were times when we got down on ourselves,\nbut you were the one to inspire us to overcome\nit all.
This tournament was our way\nof thanking you, Tsubasa.
We promised to win every match, whether official\nor not, before sending you off to Brazil.\nAnd that promise drove us to play better.
Thank you, Tsubasa.
You're the best teammate and the\ngreatest captain we could ask for!
Oh, you guys...
...
I should be the one thanking all of you.
The only reason my dream, our dream,\ncame true was because of all of you.
I couldn't have done it without you guys.\nThis tournament reminded me of that.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart! It was\nan honor to play with every single one of you!
Tsubasa!
Everyone put their best foot forward,\nbut I think <avatar_name> played especially hard.
I've no doubt you'll keep the\nteam going after we graduate.
Tsubasa, you were the one who said <avatar_name>\nwas exceptional, even before the tournament.
Even Coach was worried what would happen to the\nteam after the current upperclassmen graduate.
But with <avatar_name> here,\nI think there's nothing to worry about.
I'm sure he'll carry on the legacy\nwe're leaving behind.
When you first said you wanted to be as good as\nTsubasa, I just thought you looked up to him.
But you've proven time and time again that you've\ngot mettle, and that you were serious about\nbeing Tsubasa's equal.
When you first said you wanted to be better than\nTsubasa, I thought you might be a few cards short\nof a full deck.
But you've proven time and time again that you've\ngot mettle, and you've grown tremendously since\nthen.
I guess it's not so bad to aim high.
I knew you had a positive spirit about you,\nbut I never thought you'd become this strong.
Hard work really does pay off!
<avatar_name>, you've really improved\nsince we first met.
We took the championships three times in a row,\nbut you might be able to extend that record to a\nfourth or fifth championship in a row.
It's up to you to bring glory\nto Nankatsu MS's soccer program!
For glory!
I'm not sure I can do it.
It depends on the team.
Now that's promising!
I'm sure you can! You're stronger than you think!
If you need to find your confidence, there's\nnothing better than a little elbow grease!
Well, there aren't too many go-getters\namong the first and second years.
That's why you have to step up\nand help them get better.
We all aimed to be as good as Tsubasa, so you'll\nhave to set that benchmark for everyone from now\non. I know you can do it!
One more thing. You've got to carry\non my legacy of making bold plays!
Well...I suppose it's better nothing.
You don't have to use your face\nto stop the shots, though.
What's wrong with that?!
Everyone put their best foot forward,\nbut I think Ishizaki played especially hard.
Huh? I did?
I'd say so, too.
You're the reason we're feeling\nso accomplished in this tournament.
We were going for an undefeated record after\nwinning nationals three years in a row.
But you were the one to suggest we owe it to\nTsubasa to win. That really changed our mindset.
I agree!
I played quite hard, too...
You guys are the greatest...
We know that. But the one who got\nyour head back in the game is Ishizaki.
You guys are the greatest...
I agree, too. I could only leave the team in\ngood conscience because he took over as captain\nwhile I was gone.
I truly believe he'll be a great captain\non his high school team.
Tsubasa...
Hehe... If you have such high hopes for me,\nthen I'll have to work hard and not let you down.
But, we're headed to Nankatsu High, you know.
The team there plays at a high level,\nfrom what I hear.
Ack...
Nankatsu High would be my first choice,\nbut they are pretty strict about admission.\nWithout good grades...
Things will work out.\nIf you need tutoring, leave that to us!
Take some of that boldness of yours\nand apply it studying!
Oh, I will! That's the one thing I AM good at.\nLet's show that entrance exam who's boss!
Can't wait to see it, Captain Ishizaki!
But before that, we have that\ninternational tournament in the States.
Taking on the world, huh...
We've got to take our game\nto the next level, as well.
Yeah. I've been mentally preparing myself for it.
Me, a Japan rep...\nI'm excited and nervous at the same time...
That makes you a rep too, <avatar_name>.
You weren't even a starter until just a while ago,\nand now look at you. Truly amazing.
I worked hard for this!
I'll be a starter\nas a rep, too!
I can't believe it myself.
No one'll deny that.
I've been working hard\nsince I was in elementary school.
We're two-of-a-kind, I tell ya.\nLet's continue to do our best!
Well isn't someone pretty impressed with himself.
You've proved plenty capable as a starter during\nthis tournament. Just remember, you'll have to\nwork even harder than before.
Let's keeping working hard together, <avatar_name>!
Me neither, bud.
But we were chosen. It's time to work\nfor a spot on the starting roster!
<avatar_name>.
I feel like the way you play\nepitomizes a love of soccer.
I think that's the reason you've been able to\nlearn so much in such a short amount of time.
Come to think of it,\nI think you remind me of myself.
We take on the world next.
We can forget about class seniority and play\nside-by-side as equals. Come on, the world awaits!
Here I come, Ichijo!
Bring it on, Nitta!
He's cranked up the speed on his\nFalcon Shot since the Shizuoka Regionals!
You're still too soft, Ichijo!
It's so hot inside mid-summer. It's\nprobably cooler on the field playing soccer.
Took the words outta my mouth.\nLet's hurry and finish cleaning up.
What should we do with this scorebook and tape?
Ah, we used those to study\nNankatsu for the Shizuoka Regionals.
You can chuck those out.
Oh, okay.
...
We couldn't do it this year, but Nitta and\nIchijo will be chompin' at the bit next year.
We've shown them the ropes. They know what to do.\nThey'll beat Nankatsu and take Otomo to Nationals.
Becoming national champs is not just some\npipe dream. I know they can make it happen!
...
Speaking of, where is Nishio?
He went to look for some boxes, but it's\nbeen a minute. I wonder what's keepin' 'im.
H-Hey, big news guys!
"Junior Hero League"?
Y-Yeah...
I was heading to the staff room to grab\nsome boxes when I overheard the coach.
He was on the phone with the Soccer Association.\nApparently, there's a qualifier to decide who\ngets to represent Japan in America next month.
Best part is... Coach said we're going!
Basically, they'll be exhibitions.
So, ya think they'll let us third years play, too?
Why wouldn't they? I heard they were\nletting everyone play, regardless of year.
Seriously?!
Know anything about other\nschools in the tournament?
Thought you might ask. Voila!\nI got a copy of the bracket!
Now, we're talking!
Lemme see!
Oh... so there are 14 teams total,\ndivided into groups of 7 teams each.
So who's in our bracket?
There's Nankatsu... Toho Academy... Furano...
Did you say Nankatsu?!
But we didn't even make it to Nationals. If they're\nincluding us in such an important tournament...
Ha! That means they see us\nas a national-level team anyway!
And they probably matched up teams with\nsimilar skill levels to help choose the reps.
That must mean they respect\nwhat we put together on the field!
...
Hey guys, listen up.
Huh? What's up?
I see. I get you, Urabe.
I had the same thought, too.
Urabe, as our captain, shouldn't you\ntalk to the first and second years, too?
I plan to.
Everyone, to the field!\nNakayama, go get the first and second years!
Roger!
Let's do this!\nBreak off into teams for a practice match!
Tak!
Impressive, <avatar_name>! We're just practicing,\nbut you're turning up the heat!
First years! Second years! Huddle up!
Okay!
What's the deal?
So Otomo is taking part in this Junior Hero\nLeague. We'll be facing Nankatsu, Toho, and\nFurano.
A rematch against Nankatsu!
Not to mention Toho and Furano!
That's why I wanted to talk to all of you.\nOpen your ears and listen close.
We've dedicated ourselves to the game this past\nyear to make certain Nankatsu didn't give us the\nrun around... to challenge Tsubasa.
...
We weren't a match for them, but we did our best.\nThat loss was unavoidable. I'm sure you all\nfeel the same.
...
But I can't help wishing that we'd won.\nAm I the only one?
No way! I know how you feel.
I still think about that match\nevery night when I close my eyes.
Exactly.
We can't let this opportunity go to waste!
This is our shot. We'll beat Nankatsu!
You'll need to be even more prepared than you\nwere leading up to the Shizuoka Regionals...\nAre you with us?
Of course, we are, Captain!
I'm tired of living with this regret.\nWe'll do whatever you say! Isn't that right?
Tak!
Tak!
That's what I was hoping to hear.
Our goal for the Junior Hero League\nis to win without a loss!
C-Can we really do that?
Looking at the matches, we face Nankatsu last.
If we hope to stand a chance against the\nthree-time champions, we can't go losing\nto any paltry runners-up!
Even if they are Toho and Furano. Am I wrong?
No, that's absolutely right. We can't go in\nthinking we might lose... That's not how a\nteam gets stronger.
We'll win our matches against Furano, against Toho\nAcademy... Then, we face the biggest challenge of\nthem all, Tsubasa and Nankatsu. I'm all fired up!
All right, Nitta! That's the spirit!
Starting tomorrow, we're diving into the deep end\nof the training pool for the Junior Hero League!
Rest up and be ready!
Heck yeah!
Wham!
Come on! You call that a tackle? Nankatsu\nwill laugh in our face if that's all you got.
(I've gotta be better. If I can't catch a shot\nlike that, I won't be able to stop the Drive Shot\nor the Tiger Shot!)
There's a lot we need to do if we're\ngoing to win all the games in our bracket.
First, us third years have to be moving all\nthe time, like we were at the Shizuoka Regionals.
After losing to Nankatsu, we haven't been pushing\nourselves like we should. We've lost a step.
Not just physically, but our game sense\nhas dulled without proper competition.
Game sense is more important than most think.\nA good team will always capitalize on the smallest\nmistake the other team makes.
All the schools that made it to Nationals\nhave been honing their edge after playing some\ngrueling matches, and we've just been coasting.
Not to mention, we didn't even get to test our\nmettle against as many top teams at Nationals.
We've got to assume the gap between\nNankatsu and ourselves has only grown.
The only thing we can do\nto fill that gap is train.
Normal training won't do. To forge ourselves anew,\nwe must hold ourselves over the flames.
Bring it on! I'm ready.
...
There's one last thing we've gotta do.
And what's that?
Our starting lineup needs a tune-up.
Besides Tsubasa, Nankatsu has Kisugi,\nTaki, Izawa, Takasugi, and there's Ishizaki, too.\nHaving strong starters is huge.
True.\nIt was THEM that scored that third point on us.
And there's next year to think about.
Nitta and Ichijo will be leading Otomo next year,\nbut this team needs more than those two players\nto win at Regionals and Nationals.
Nitta is known to be an aggressive striker,\nso they'll be all over him. We need another\nforward who can make 'em sweat.
Ichijo on defense. Nitta on offense.\nThat much won't change, but we'll need people\nto cover midfield in my and Kishida's place.
Without Nakayama and Nishio,\nthere's too much pressure on Ichijo.\nWe need a new leader on defense.
You can say that again.
If we can build a stronger base lineup,\nthey can hammer out a different playstyle\nthan our current one.
When we hit the field tomorrow, we need to look\nfor players that can step into those roles.
Kishida, you and the others have to help\nme analyze the first and second years.
We can handle that.
Will we be able to find the sort of players we\nneed? I hope some of them are up to the challenge.
Now that that's settled, let's put together\na training regimen for tomorrow!
That's it for warm-ups.
Listen up, everybody!
Tomorrow marks the beginning of Otomo's journey\ntoward dominating in this upcoming qualifier.
Today's practice is in preparation for that.\nWe'll be training even harder than we did\nbefore the Shizuoka Regionals!
I hope you're all ready!
Yeah, we are!
We'll kick things off with a 30km run! Go, go, go!
Yessir!
Go, fight, win, Otomo!
Go Otomo! All the way!
I can't hear you! Louder!
Yes, Sir!
Go! Fight! Win! Otomo!
Oh man...
We ran 30km every day going into Regionals.\nHow can we be so exhausted already?
Sure, we haven't trained in a bit,\nbut I didn't expect us to be this soft.
That's why we have to do this. We hafta see\nit through. We can't just sit here moping!
Alright! Take a breather and come back.\nThere's still work to do today.
R-Right!
Come on, guys! Louder!
Yes, Sir!
Let's play five-on-five. Split into teams!
Yessir!
Everybody's sluggish after that run.
But the ones that really wanna be here\nwon't let it dampen their spirits.
That's what we're looking for.
What was that? That pathetic tackle\nwon't cut the mustard by any means.
Way to go, Nitta.
(If there was just ONE more guy in that class...\nJust one more.)
Hey, Urabe. That first year is pretty good.
Who?
Bring it! You're not gettin' past me!
Ngh! What was that shot?!
Well... He scored a goal on Ichijo.
He must have a strong core to be able to\nkick like that while on his last legs.
Bring it! You ain't got nothin'!
Wh-What the...?!
I see... He avoided Nakayama's tackle.
He must have a strong core to be able to\nfeint like that while on his last legs.
Think you can stop me?
Wh-What?!
Nice. He took the ball off Kishida. Not bad.
He must have a strong core to tackle\nlike that while on his last legs.
Yeah. Must.
(That first year has powerful legs, but more\nthan that, you can see in his eyes that there's\nsomething different about him.)
(It might be worth testing him.)
Hey, what's his name?
If I remember correctly...
It's <avatar_name>.
Hey! Stay after practice. We need to talk to you.
-- After Practice --
We haven't really talked much, have we?
Let's get acquainted.\nI'm Urabe, captain of the soccer club.
Ah! Yes, I know!
You finally noticed me!
Did I do something wrong?
Am I gonna be a starter?
You've got a lot of energy in your tank for just\nfinishing such hard training. That's impressive.
Bit snarky, are we now?
Confidence isn't a bad thing, though.
No, that's not it...
(Strange. He was so confident on the field.\nIs he really so timid off the pitch?)
Hold on there, cowboy. Let me talk first.
Otomo needs to build a stronger lineup for\nthe upcoming tournament and next year's team.
I've been on the lookout for first and second\nyears that can help Nitta and Ichijo carry that\nweight.
You did really well today in practice.\nEverything from your stamina, to your technique,\nand more importantly... Your spirit is top notch.
Starting tomorrow, you'll be on first string!
We'll be sure to get you into tip-top shape,\nso you'd better be ready for the pain train!
I'll take us to victory!
Wouldn't have it any other way!
No pain, no gain!
I'll show up Nitta and Ichijo!
Now, that's what I like to hear.
Never lose that nerve!
It seems you've got the right head for it,\nas well. I've got a good feeling about you.
That's right. Hard work is\nwhat makes this team strong.
Dedicate yourself to the training.\nI expect nothing less than your best!
Heh. You are a bit cheeky.
But the top is where you want to aim.
We've got some experience on you,\nso you can't hold back.
If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to ask.
We're your teammates. We're in this together.
Junior Hero League: First Day
I never thought we'd get to stand on this\nsoil again so soon. And in our cleats no less!
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Same here. I always thought next year would be\nthe one, but I never thought it'd be like this.
For real.
Hey <avatar_name>, this daily grind\nworn you out yet?
I'm wiped.
Not even!
How about you? Got your agility back?
Well, of course.
Shape up, <avatar_name>! If you're gonna be out\nof commission so soon, you'll never be ready!
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm impressed.
That training was rough even for me, <avatar_name>.\nYou're hardcore.
You went there, huh?
Well, I'm not quite at peak performance, but\nI'm back to about where I was before the Shizuoka\nRegionals!
Let's get going, guys!\nIt's about time for the opening ceremony!
Roger!
The opening ceremony for the Junior Hero League\nsponsored by the Soccer Association will commence\nshortly.
Starting just this month, the best teams from\nNationals and even various regionals have\ngathered. But this is no mere exhibition.
The known goal of these games is that they will\ndetermine the players for the international\ntournament in America next month!
While the top schools facing off is one thing,\nindividual play will also be important. The top\nplayers are competing to represent our nation!
Who from among these teams will be chosen to\nstand as heroes representing all of Japan?
And here come the players now!
We made it in time... somehow.
I'm impressed you were able to\norganize this on such short notice.
You and me both.
It was only possible thanks to all the\nparticipating schools being so accommodating.
I still can't believe the French International was\ncanceled and replaced with the Junior Youth World\nChallenge.
And now there'll be even more ridiculously\nskilled teams from all over the world...
The training camp... The European tour... All\nthose carefully laid plans just went up in smoke.
Indeed.
Every match is an opportunity\nfor a player to grow.
Exactly. That's why this\nJunior Hero League is so important.
Knowing that this isn't just an exhibition, but\nthat we're selecting players to represent Japan,\nshould inspire everyone to do their best.
Hopefully, the players can build on the potential\nthey showed at Nationals.
The Junior Hero League is a chance for us\nto see their growth in action.
Then we will have succeeded in another objective,\nas well.
We will have aided them in developing the kind of\nskill it takes to compete on the world stage.
Indeed. We've done our part.\nNow, we just have to believe in them.
Alright guys, the Junior Hero League is starting!
Our opponents are all top players. Judging from\npast exploits, we might actually be at the bottom\nof the pack here.
But you know Otomo's soccer mantra.\nWe topple the giants!
And that's how we're going\nto approach each and every match!
Don't let your guard down for a second! Face the\nother team with muscles tensed and fangs bared!
We're going to win every single time!
Tak!
Nitta, you're the ace. Otomo's fate\nis in your hands. I'm counting on you.
Leave it to me, Captain.\nI'll get the goals we need. Trust me.
Here comes the first match, <avatar_name>.\nNervous?
I'm too excited to be nervous!
I-Is it obvious?!
My teammates will be there, too!
Excited, eh? Admirable.
(He's just like Tsubasa...)
Well, hope you save some of that\nexcitement for the game today!
Did your voice just crack?
That's all part of the game.\nJust hafta get used to it!
Yep. You're not alone out on the pitch.
Play with confidence!\nWe'll be there to support you!
Well, let's get going then!
Idziemy!
Listen up.
The Junior Hero League is going to be the cream\nof the crop. They're bringing in all the best\nteams from Nationals.
If you put on a good show here,\nother players are going to notice.
And if that happens, other players'll be keen\nto practice with us, and we can learn from each\nother.
Find a good rival to compete with,\nand your skill level will skyrocket.
Time to get out there!
Urabe. Haven't played you Nankatsu SC guys\nsince elementary school, I don't think.
I know we have different teammates and teams now,\nbut coming from the Meiwa FC, I can't get it out\nof my head.
That's what I was thinking!
Seeing all these familiar faces from elementary\nschool makes me feel one thing: we're going to\ntake you down. Y'know, for old time's sake.
Well, I believe you're mistaken.\nThis game is ours!
Show me what'cha got!\nWe'll make you eat those words!
Argh! I can't believe we lost to you again!
Gotta admit...\nYour passion for the game is pretty awesome.
That's the kind of soccer we can learn from.
...
Well, this tournament's just begun.\nLet's both keep giving it our best.
Yeah. See ya.
...
Sawaki.
What?
I'm not from Meiwa FC, so maybe today\nfeels different for you than it does for me.
...
But the frustration of losing?\nMurasawa, Suenaga, and I are right there with you.
Narita...
You better believe we'll pay them\nback for this in high school. 
You can count on it!
Your school may also be in Shizuoka with\nNankatsu...
...but our first match in the tournament being\nagainst a team that wasn't in Nationals?\nMust be our lucky day.
Say what?!
We should get a good warm-up for this thing\nblasting shots into the back of your goal!
We'll see about that.
Don't let 'em get to you. We'll show them.
Sounds good to me!
Now do you see, Minamiuwa?\nThis is what Otomo MS is capable of!
Urgh! No freakin' way!
Beaten by some backwater school!
We may be less well-known at a national level...
...but we're no less dedicated when it comes to\nfighting our way to Nationals and bringing down\nNankatsu.
We put the work in!\nYou can't afford to take us lightly!
I hate to admit it, but you're right.\nWe looked down on you and paid the price.
I think we learned a thing or two that'll\ncome in handy as this tournament progresses.
Well, anyway, good luck ahead!
Tak! You, too!
I think we learned a thing or two that'll\ncome in handy as this tournament progresses.
...
What's up with you, Ishida? You look... happy.
What's up with you, Ishida? You look... happy.
I was just thinking... there are strong teams and\nplayers all over the country.
I'm smiling because I'm looking forward to playing\nmore in my high school years.
Nakayama! Idziemy!
Come on, Kishida!
Wh-What?!
Too easy!
All right, team change!
Man, you really got me back there,\nNakayama. Looks like you got your groove back.
Just recently, yeah. Finally.
If I don't maintain a high level of training...\nI'm no good.
Hey, <avatar_name>! What kinda flimsy shot\nwas that? Put some more oomph into it!
Uh... Okay!
Flimsy? My shot's not flimsy!
It's no good if the only thing that runs is\nyour mouth! Now, show me a better shot! Got it?
Well, your mouth certainly moves fast enough!\nTry putting some of that behind the ball! Get me?
Also, defense! You're giving <avatar_name>\nforever to set up! Don't make it so easy for 'im!
Got it!
He's strict as ever, eh?
Yeah, but... Everyone's stepping up.\nThe shouting just keeps us all energized.
Well, winning the last match\nprobably didn't hurt, either.
I mean, we beat one of the\ntop four teams from Nationals.
I mean, we beat one of the\ntop eight teams from Nationals.
Having a win makes it feel like\nwhat we're doing is paying off.\nHopefully, it carries us a bit further.
Okay. We're up next!
Hey, Nitta! We're not gonna lose to you and\na gaggle of first and second-year students!
Then you better have something\nimpressive to show us!
Let's do this, guys! Don't let their age\nscare you. You're up to this challenge!
All right!
Nitta's really been stepping\nup to take the lead, lately.
That's intentional.\nHe said he's gonna be Otomo's big ace next year.
Yeah, that's probably how it'll turn out.
Urabe.
Nitta was in good position to be next year's\ncaptain. If he's already engaged, all the better.
True. I feel comfortable entrusting\nhim with the future of this team.
That's it for practice today! You're dismissed.
Awesome practice guys!
Hey, <avatar_name>. You free tonight?
I was hoping you'd join me\nfor a little extra training.
I'll contact you later about when to meet. See ya!
Hey. Took ya long enough.
So, what're we doing?
We can't use the grounds at night...
We're going for a run.
Who said we're going to the school?
I have a circuit I like to run different from\nthe one we use with the rest of the team.
It's pretty hilly, so expect your calves to be\ngroaning by the end.\nBut you should be fine, right?
Dobra, idziemy!
Phew, let's take a break.
This stadium is where we lost during Regionals.\nIt's like an origin story for us.
This time, for sure... We'll take Nankatsu down!
For those graduating?
Sweet revenge!
I mean, they're not the only reason.\nBut they are a big part of it.
You bet. I swore I'd surpass Tsubasa.
But it's more than that. Beating Nankatsu has\nbeen the goal the Captain and the others have\nlong fought for, too.
Those guys, Urabe in particular,\nare great players. They don't back down,\nand they don't hesitate.
As Captain, Urabe uses that strength to\nlead Otomo. I really look up to him.
And I wanna live up to what he sees in me.
To do that, I'm taking us undefeated through this\ntournament. I'll have to play better than my best.
You have to keep training\nand getting stronger, too.
If you, Ichijo, and I work hard, we can turn\nthe dream of beating Nankatsu into a reality.
Okay! Let's up the pace on the way back!\nDon't lag behind!
Tachibana Bros, what's up? Been a while.
That it has.\nLast match was what... elementary school?
Our aerial soccer's really soaring today\nby comparison. Hope you're ready!
Tachibanas... Remember me?
Wait, don't tell me. You're, uh...
Oh, yeah. You're that guy that got injured by\nour Triangle Shot back in elementary school.
Bingo. Don't worry, though. I hold no grudge.\nInjuries happen.
Can't say I was happy about it at the time...
But today, nothing's taking me out of this game!\nI'm gonna shut you two down.
Heh! We'll see about that!
It's on! Let's go as hard as we can!
Yes! We won!
We stopped the Tachibana brothers!\nOur teamwork's gotten so much better!
Darn it. We lost...\nGuess we need to head back to the drawing board.
Nishio. You put your soul into your defense.\nIt really gave us a run for our money.
Yeah, well, that was a heck of a match.\nYour combinations are insanely savage.
Well, if you say so, I won't disagree.
Good luck in your other matches!
Break a leg! But not really!
Gotcha! We'll hafta do this again sometime.
If I remember right, in the finals at Tokyo,\nMusashi played Toho Academy.
Yeah, and they've got Misugi, too. He gave us\na tough time and then some back in elementary\nschool.
I've analyzed footage from the Tokyo Regionals.\nThe moment Misugi joined the game the whole\ndynamic shifted. Their team became unstoppable.
So it comes down to stopping him. He practically\ntook us down single-handedly in elementary school.
What're we chopped liver?
Tak! With us here, the team\ndoesn't have to rely on Misugi.
Musashi's Top Trio's gonna demolish your defense!
In that case, I'm gonna do\nthe work of all three of you!
This match looks like it's\ngoing to be a real battle.
Urgh...
We... lost.
We... lost.
Seriously, how tough is Otomo's defense?!
Even though I'd heard you gave Tsubasa a tough\ntime, you were far better than I expected.
You're one heck of a player yourself, Misugi.\nIt's hard to believe you took two years off.
Things may've been different\nhad you played the whole game.
...
Nitta.
Yeah?
You have some rough edges but you're incredibly\ntalented. Do me a favor and keep sharpening that\nedge.
And you take care of your health, Misugi.
After all, this wouldn't be fun if we ran\nout of quality competition like you.
Thanks.
Well then, I look forward to doing this again.
Tak! Later!
Man, I'm beyond beat.
Yeah. We've only had two matches, but it feels\nlike we've gone through at least double that.
To be honest, no team other than Nankatsu\nreally gave us that much of a fight at the\nShizuoka Regionals.
Playing with everything you got for\na whole game is super exhausting.
Should we maybe take it easy today?
Guys, where's your stamina?
I suppose we should give our\nbodies a little time to recover.
You might be in a league of your own, buddy.
Alright. For today's afternoon training, let's\nrun to Nankatsu MS and do some reconnaissance.
Whoa...!
Hey! That cross won't cut it! What are\nthe forwards supposed to do with that?
Un-Understood!
That goes for the forwards, too! Don't just\nblame the pass! You hafta step up all the time,\nand you're not doing it today!
You have to get in the defense's head.\nYou have to create space. The chance won't come if\nyou're standing there twiddling your thumbs!
Yessir!
I can't hear you! If you don't put your\nheart into it, this game will eat you alive!
Yes, Sir!
Just two matches and we're\nalready gasping for air...
Meanwhile Nankatsu's training at this intensity?!
Gah!
Zróbmy to!
Hop to it, guys!
Hop to it, guys!
Okay!
Guys, you have to read your opponent! You won't be\nable to cut them off if you're just chasing them!
Yessir!
No freakin' way!
Incredible. He's weaving through the\ndefenders like they're standing still!
(Tsubasa's taken his dribble to a\nnew level since we last saw him.)
(Will our Otomo Quartet combinations\neven be enough to stop him?)
Oh, hey, it's Urabe!
You guys doing some recon?
Y-Yeah. Well, uh, we were\njust out for a run, I mean.
You guys sure do a lot of running.
Oh, yeah. It looks like we got matched up with\nyou guys for the last day of the tournament.
Can't wait to see you there! Good luck!
...
(Nankatsu have leveled way up since the matches\nat Nationals. Who could've imagined they'd come\nso far in such a short time?)
(Otomo has no chance of beating\nNankatsu as things stand right now.)
(If we're gonna win...)
We're making training even harder?!
That's what I said.
We're already bustin' our chops out there.\nYou sure this won't accidentally kill off some\nof the first and second years?
We're pretty much going as hard as we can\nalready. Any harder than this, and well...
We fought hard on the practice field and\npowered up before the Shizuoka Regionals.
But we still lost to Nankatsu. And they're\neven stronger now than they were then.
At this rate, the gap between\nus will become a chasm.
Urabe has a good point.
Nishio.
We're not as good as them... yet.\nSo if we want to win, we can't step off the gas.
Not to mention, their first and\nsecond years are becoming just as good.\nAnd with Tsubasa to teach them...
Even if we have Nitta and Ichijo with us, we might\nnot even make the Shizuoka Regionals next year,\nlet alone Nationals.
...
I get it. You guys are right.\nI'll start hammering out a training regimen.
Push to your heart's content, Urabe. Don't\nworry about us... We'll follow where you lead.
Okay. I'm counting on you guys.
Hey guys. Two wins in a row seems proof\nenough to me that we've improved.
But that doesn't mean we can relax now\nif we hope to do the same to Nankatsu.
In order to do that, starting today,\nit's all aboard the crazy train to training town!
I think you all saw the level Nankatsu was at\nyesterday. That's the level we have to go beyond.
"Just okay" isn't gonna cut it against them.\nBut we can do it. I believe in us!
If you wanna improve, then stick with us!\nThink you can handle it?
Y-Yes!
Guys! That was weak sauce!\nSay it like you mean it! Make me believe you!
Are you ready for some soccer?!
YEAH!
(Nitta...)
(When we lost at the Regional Finals\nI swore I'd surpass Tsubasa someday.)
(But the way he moved yesterday...\nIt feels like I'm trying to run down a racecar.)
(I need to narrow the distance between us.\nAnd I'll figure out how in this tournament.)
(Next year he's going off to Brazil. If I miss\nthis chance, who knows when my next one will be?)
(I also respect Urabe a lot,\nand beating Nankatsu is his dream.)
(This may be our last real shot\nat making that dream a reality!)
Okay! 50 meter dash! 20 reps, let's go!
Move!
Too slow, guys!
It's not enough to just do the reps! If you\nwanna get faster, you gotta push yourselves!
G-Got it!
Here I come! Try and stop me!
Oof...
Hey, what gives?! I barely touched you.\nDon't tell me you're that much of a pushover!
If you wanna win, get up!\nGet up and let's do it again!
H-Hey, Nitta. That's enough, man.
Everyone's beat. We've been going tilt since\nthis morning. If we don't let 'em rest...
Nitta, this is too much, man.
Not everyone's at your level.
No, I'm not. They're just too soft!
That's why we must train like this.\nThey have to level up!
Being strong takes work. It isn't supposed to be\neasy. We must reach the edge of our limitations,\nand then surpass them.
Nitta...
(Nankatsu isn't strong just because of\nTsubasa's skill. Their team is good together.)
(If we're gonna beat them,\nour players have a long way to go.)
(That's why I'm pushing everyone to get\non my level and commit to the team.)
(I want to... I need to make our\nteam stronger the way Urabe did!)
(And then we'll become winners, like Tsubasa.)
Let's call it a day, then!\nYou're dismissed, everyone!
Thank... thank you!
The third years will take care of clean up!\nFirst and second years, go home and rest up!
And put your training uniforms in the\nlaundry after you change! We'll wash 'em!
Nitta, where are you headed?
We can't use the school grounds at night,\nso I'm gonna go practice in the park.
Y-You're not done?
I'll grab my stuff later.\nLeave the locker room open for me.
Hey, Urabe.\nThink we should do something about Nitta?
The way he's going, the first and second years\nwill burn out. He might even burn himself out.
I know.
You know... but?
But... I think right now,\nhe's working through something.
Remember how he took that running shot\nagainst Nankatsu without trapping the ball?
I get it. But still...
Nitta will get past this. I know he will.
If Otomo's gonna come through this as a stronger\nteam together, we have to believe he can.
Urabe...
Yo! You're Nitta, right?\nBeen looking forward to play against you.
That so?\nGuessing you're that ace killer, Makoto Soda.
You talk to all more experienced players that way?\nGutsy.
As sure as I'm the ace killer, you'll be\nlucky to dribble the ball ten feet this game.
(Makoto Soda, the defender\nwho nearly shut down Tsubasa.)
(If I can't outplay him,\nI won't ever catch up to Tsubasa!)
Alright! We did it!
That's three in a row!
I must be losing my edge.\nYou guys didn't even make it to Nationals.
Nitta. I hate to admit it, but you won this round.
Lemme say one thing, though. Aren't you playing\na bit too risky? I get the feeling... I dunno...\nLike you're spinning your wheels.
That's not a sore loser talking, is it?
Ha, say what you want.
But I'm talking from experience. I've faced all\nsorts of aces and I'm just tellin' ya what I know.
Well, anyway, good luck ahead!
...
Otomo MS, huh? You guys are on a roll.
You know, our teams have something in common.\nWe're both underdogs.
Well, by the time this tournament's over,\nwe'll be the team to beat.
Such confidence. Good luck with that.
Nitta! Been waitin' to run\ninto you since Regional Finals.
Now, that's what I'm talking about.\nLet's see who's the better forward!
Bring it. You guys gave Nankatsu a hard time, so\nit'll be all the more glorious when we crush you!
Got some nerve talkin' to yer betters that\nway. But I can dig it. Dude with a 'tude.
But don't expect mercy. I don't care\nif you're younger. M'gonna lay you out.
Stupid! We're too tough to lose like this!
It was your toughness that gave us the win.
Huh?
We conquer the strong. That's what Otomo does.\nYou're another team in a long line of tough guys\nwho thought they had us where they wanted us.
Ah, I see. I respect that. M'the same.
It'll be my turn to bust you next, tough guy.\nBut you keep doin' you.
You bet! Right back at ya!
Nitta, you're no pushover.\nDidn't expect ya to be that fierce.
Surprised you're acknowledging defeat so plainly.
Is what it is.
Just one thing...
...
Actually, it's nothin'. See ya. Knock 'em dead.
Jito, what were you gonna say back there?
Oh, well... That guy seemed like\nhe was about to burst a blood vessel.\nHe was goin' too hard too much.
Same thing in a brawl.\nYou strain too hard, you end up hittin' a wall.
But he wouldn't've listened anyway.
(Hope he puts it together on his own.)
Alright! That's it for circuit training!
Woohoo!
Dang. Everyone's drained.
Maybe it's because today's hotter than usual.
Yeah, and no breeze, either.\nCan't we take a little break?
Ichijo, have you lost your mind?!
Come on, man.
Everyone, off your butts!\nLet's get back to movin'!
Nitta! Take a look around you!
Everyone's wrecked from going full speed every\nmoment of every day. We literally can't continue.
Ichijo!
He's got a point.
Let's adjust our conditioning!
Not you, too!
Adjust our conditioning?! Our condition\nis that we're not ready to face Nankatsu!
We have to press on and keep working!
Our next couple matches are against Furano,\nToho Academy, and Nankatsu! They're gonna be\nour toughest competition yet!
And didn't we all make a promise?\nDidn't we promise that we'd do whatever it took\nto keep up with the best on our team?!
Ugh...
How do you intend to beat strong opponents\nif you're breaking already...
Agh...
Whoa, Nitta! Hold it together!
Quick! Get him to the infirmary!\nIchijo, gimme a hand!
O-Okay!
Nitta...
...I see. Okay. Thank you.
How is he?
Looks like his body's pretty busted up\nand suffering from extreme exhaustion.\nHe's gonna spend the night at the hospital.
It's a good thing the\nschool nurse was there today.
Yeah, I'm glad it wasn't an injury\nor sickness or anything like that.
This is all my fault. If I'd only stopped him,\nwhen Kishida said he was worried.
You're not the only one to blame. It's not\nlike I stepped in to calm him down, either.
Kishida.
Anyway, let's call it a day.
Looks like everyone's kinda shaken.\nI don't think practice is gonna happen.
Let the younger dudes head home first.\nCan you notify everyone?
Sure.
Us third years will handle\nthings here and head home after.
Okay.
--That Night
<avatar_name>! This is bad!\nThey said Nitta's disappeared from the hospital!
No luck. He's nowhere to be found.
Looks like he hasn't gone home, either.
We checked the parks around the neighborhood\nand he wasn't at any of them, either.
Where the heck could he have gone?
...You don't think?
If he's training, then...?
<avatar_name>, do you have any ideas?
Training? In his condition?!
No, you know what.\nConsidering Nitta, it's entirely possible.\nIf you have any idea of a place, spill it!
(Not yet! There's still too much to do!)
Nitta!
Captain?! Everyone?! Why are you here?
Ah. <avatar_name> told ya, huh?
Sneaking out of the hospital, Nitta! Are you nuts?
I'm not nuts. I've work to do.\nThis tournament won't win itself.
You all saw Tsubasa at Nationals, didn't you?
Even when he was injured he fought all\nthe way through. Compared to that this is...
Urgh...
Look, even I know you're overdoing it.
If I'd just had you reel it back in a bit...\nI'm sorry.
No. It's not your fault, Captain.\nI should've been fine with that level of training.
Urabe you worked extra hard to be ready for\nNankatsu. We became stronger, learning from\nyour example.
This time I wanna be the one to do that. I want\nto inspire the others by working hard myself.
And I already decided I'd be the one to make the\ngraduating players' hopes of defeating Nankatsu\ncome true!
Nitta...
...
Starting tomorrow, you're\ntaking a break from training.
What?!
Urabe?!
I can't imagine playing the next couple matches\nwithout him. Making sure he's healthy for games\nis priority number one.
You're gonna let your body heal for the Furano\nmatch. Got it? That's an order from your captain.
...
...Understood.
Now, let's get you back to the hospital.
You can all head home.
All right, see you tomorrow.
Hey, <avatar_name>...\nRemember what Nitta said before?
Didn't we all make a big promise before the match?\nThat we'd do whatever it took to keep up with the\nolder kids?!
Well, Nitta kept that promise. He gave\nus everything he's got today, and more.
What incredible drive.
Maybe he pushed too hard.
That's for sure.
I agree.
But... That's just the kinda guy he is.
Me and Nitta were together at Nankatsu SC back\nin elementary. And at Nationals, we played against\nTakeshi, the guy at Toho now.
Sawada was an amazing player, even back then,\nbut Nitta faced him with sheer will.\nThat's how we won the championship.
And he's still doing the same today.\nIf it'll help the team win, he'll push himself\nfurther than anyone can imagine, even in practice.
What about us?\nFeels like we're just holding him back.
We let him take on all the responsibility.\nWhy should he be the only one burning himself out?
He should be able to rely on us!
We have to support him!
Yeah, exactly!
Yeah, exactly!
The reason he got so upset is\nbecause we've been dragging our feet.
He shouldn't have to pick up our slack.
Right guys? We're going to get our\nheads back in this and support him!
Tak!
Yo! Morning.
Yup, sure is.
...
Something on your mind, Urabe?
Yeah, since yesterday. I'm just wondering...\nIs Nitta's willingness to push himself so hard\nactually worth it for the team?
Oh...
Like, this summer we put up that "Defeat\nNankatsu!" poster, and you know how hard\nwe trained. And for what? We lost anyway.
Nankatsu is still miles ahead of us. Heck,\nthey're practically moving at escape velocity.
Has this all been a big mistake from the\nbeginning? I can't get the notion out of my head.
...
...
Hey, wait... I don't see any first or\nsecond years around. Did they not show up?!
Wha...?!
One! Two! One! Two!
Good morning, everyone!
Wh-What're you all doing?
We had a big talk last night,\nafter you guys went home.
Just like Nitta said,\nwe broke our promise to ourselves.
We weren't ready to do what it took.\nI'm sure that's why he got so mad at us.
Not only that, but we've been pushing\nway too much responsibility on him.
From here on out, we're gonna be the\nteammates he deserves: ones he can count on.
So we're gonna do everything we can!
Aw, you guys...
But, I mean, it's not like the heat wave was going\nto magically disappear. So we decided to do get\nour big run in before the day heats up.
Sorry for not asking first.
It makes sense though, right?
Yeah, it's fine. You did the right thing.
I never woulda thought to go\nwhen it's cooler in the morning.
Makes sense. We hafta work smart and hard.\nWe sorta had blinders on before.
But just how early did you get up,\nif you're finishing up the run now?!
Did you even sleep?
Early to bed, early to rise!
It's worth it for the team!
We know sleep is important.\nCan't grow without some shut eye, you know.
Well, I'm persuaded. This is how we do it.
Compared to what Nitta was doing, this is nothing.
Anyway, now we're ready\nfor the day's usual rigmarole.
We'll be waiting for you!
"Defeat Nankatsu!" right?
Y-Yeah...
Y-Yeah...
Let's get moving!
Tak!
We don't even have to push them. They found\ntheir own drive and reason to be better.
Between them and Nitta,\nI think this team's got a bright future.
Yeah, it's almost more than we deserve.
Well, that's something we can work on!
You got that right. No time to mope around.
We create our own worth!
Okay guys, we're doing our\n30km right after a warm-up!
Nitta, Ichijo, and <avatar_name> are doing\nthis for us, so we'd better do 'em proud!
Tak!
I've learned a lot from\nseeing Otomo's soccer firsthand.
Between the Otomo Quartet's defense and Nitta's\noffense, you definitely have the momentum to\ncarry you. I can't underestimate you.
Ha! So much for taking you by surprise.
Guess that's why your team was neck\nand neck with Nankatsu every time.
But we're not about to roll over and die either.\nWe've got the best teamwork and fiercest training\nschedule in Japan!
I wouldn't be so sure!\nWe've kept our noses to the grindstone for years.
But you'll see soon enough!
How're you feeling, Nitta?
Better than ever. I'm a little nervous about\nmissing practice on the days before the match,\nbut my body's doing fine.
(I can't believe I let the team\ndown by collapsing like that.)
(I HAVE to win this match for us!)
We're counting on you for offense, Nitta, so\nyou focus on goals, and we'll keep our own safe.
Ichijo?
Why're you giving me that look?
You score; I defend. Isn't that how we\nwon the championship back at Nankatsu SC?
Now, let's put our talents to good\nuse again and win this for Otomo!
You can count on me, too!
We can't let you hog all the glory!
Naturally! Zróbmy to!
Eh...?
That's the spirit! Zróbmy to!
Um... Did something happen while I was recovering,\nCaptain?
Haha! Kinda. But I need you focused on the match,\nso I'll explain later.
O-Okay.
Listen up, Nitta. No matter what happens out\nthere, no matter how badly the match is going,\ndon't even think about charging in on your own.
We're right behind you, and ready\nto support you. Never forget that.
Captain...
We did it! We did it, Nitta!\nThat's our fourth win in a row!
You bet it is! We're one step closer to our goal!
C'mon! We lost?!
Looks like Otomo MS is serious business these\ndays. Just how much did you train for this?
The way you played today, you might even be\nup there with Nankatsu or Toho Academy.
Thanks. That means a lot,\ncoming from the captain of Furano.
Good luck down the road!
Yeah, you too!
So Captain, you were gonna tell me something?
Oh, right! What happened was...
I see... So Ichijo and <avatar_name>\ndid all that for me?
To be honest, after you collapsed I started to\nwonder if maybe I'd been doing it all wrong.
But they saw it as their fault. That's why they\nwanted to make sure that they were in this with\nyou from now on.
And seeing them working so hard like that,\nit gave me... no, it gave US courage.
...
You'll be the captain next year,\nso I want you to remember this.
Obviously you need an attitude like yours\nif you're going to "make the team win."
As captain, I feel that way too, whether in\npractice or in a match. Sometimes I had to\nbe strict, but I pulled the team forward.
But that doesn't mean we would've gotten\nthis far if it were just me workin' at it.
Kishida, Nakayama, Nishio... I was a good captain\nbecause I had the rest of the team backing me up.
So I don't want you to ever think you're leading\nthe team on your own. It's called a team because\nyou've got teammates.
Put your faith in them. Mutual trust is part\nand parcel of you being their captain.
I understand!
Great job on your morning 30km, guys!\nThat was your best time yet!
Alright!
Changing our route to go by the river in the\nmorning was the right call. It's so cool and\nquiet there.
Yeah, it keeps me charged\nfor the rest of our training.
Great, let's get a move on then!
Our only remaining opponents are Toho and\nNankatsu! And I'm sure you all know that\nthey'll be like nothing we've faced before!
It's gonna be challenging, but don't fall behind!
Bring it on!\nWe're ready for anything, right guys?!
All the way!
Bring it on!
What's the matter, guys?! How do you expect to\nstop Nankatsu with a weak defense like that?!
Play like you mean it this time!
R-Right away!
(No, "trying harder" isn't gonna cut it here.\nWe need to mix it up somehow...)
(Oh, I know!)
Hey Nitta! You should try going up\nagainst the third years this time!
You think...?
(I see...\nYou really thought this through, Ichijo.)
Sure, why not? How about it, guys?
Fine by me. We won't go easy on you though!
Here I come!
Gah!
Did you see that, guys? The third years read my\nmoves, judged my feints, and worked together to\nstop me!
That's what you should be aiming for, too!\nIf you can pull that off, then no one can stop us.\nNot even Toho or Nankatsu!
Woohoo!
(That's what you wanted, right Ichijo?)
(So you saw right through me, huh?)
We should try it to learn it!
Can you teach us it directly?
<avatar_name>...
Oh, I see. Not a bad idea.
Directly?
Oh, I see. Good thinking, <avatar_name>.
Alright then, the Quartet will split into two\ngroups. Me and Nakayama together, and Kishida\nand Nishio together. Play against us in pairs.
Pay attention to your opponents' movements and\nhow they defend. Experience is the best teacher!
Yes, Captain!
Nice! Great teamwork!
But you're a little slow! Keep those feet movin',\nand don't let the heat get to you.
Nankatsu and Toho still remember what it's like to\nplay like their lives depend on it from Nationals!
R-Right!
C'mon, Nitta, at least take a water break!
We don't need you collapsing on us again!
Fine, fine! I'm never gonna live that down, am I?
Looks like they're making some real improvement.\nAnd they're getting along better, too.
Yeah, the mood's way better than before. You can\ntell that they're in it together this time.
Hey, Urabe, isn't it about time\nwe discussed it with them?
Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.
Let's make it the subject\nof our afternoon meeting.
Okay, everybody listen up.
Back in the Shizuoka Regionals,\nour strategy was "iron defense, swift attack."
In other words, we defend and Nitta counters.\nThe idea was to take Otomo's ultimate weapon\nand polish it until it was blinding.
There were plenty of things wrong with that.\nBut the main one was that it made us predictable.\nAnd Nankatsu took advantage of that.
...
But now we're different. All of us are better\nthan ever, and we're closer than ever, too.
And our teamwork is... I mean, we beat Furano MS,\nand that's their specialty.
But that's not enough to beat Nankatsu or Toho.\nWe still need a strategy.
With the new, improved Otomo, we have more\noptions than ever! And one of them's gotta work!
So what we're gonna do is watch footage of all\nour matches so far. If a lightbulb goes off,\nsay something.
Yes, Captain!
Hmm...
Wait, could that work...?!
Did you think of something, Nitta?
Sure did.
Hey Captain, how about we use me as a decoy?
You want to be a decoy?
Right.
I'm the one who's always marked, right?\nIn every match, it's always me.
So basically, I draw them away,\nand it opens everyone else up.
So you just need to feint like you're going to\npass it to me, but instead pass to one of the\nopen players. And then they can go for the shot.
Wait, you want someone else to take the shot?
Right.
After all that running, everyone's legs must be\npretty solid. And that'll be true for their shots,\ntoo.
If they make the goal, great, but even if it's\ndeflected, we get another shot on the rebound.
And if they wise up and start marking other\npeople, then maybe I can find an opening.
Good point. So far, we've been\nrelying on you for all our scoring.
But if the other players start going for shots,\nthe other team will be forced to adapt.\nIt'll disrupt their defense, at least.
Let's try putting it together!
We'll have to develop a new formation.
Solid plan. I like Nitta's thinking on this.
Yeah, and we might come up with even more\nnew ideas once we start playing differently.
Okay, let's hit the field!
Together, we'll build a brand new Otomo!\nNankatsu and Toho won't know what hit 'em!
Awesome!
Yo, Hyuga. We haven't seen each other\nsince the Shizuoka Regionals, have we?
Otomo MS... Looks like you guys've had a pretty\ngood win streak. But do you really think that's\ngonna cut it against the national champs?
Time to come back to reality!
Oh, we're already here, and the harder\nyou come for us, the mightier we become!
Hello, Nitta.
Hi, Takeshi.
I remember losing to you at the\nchampionship when we were kids.
I let Nankatsu SC steal their\nsecond championship in a row.
But today will be different! I've been\naching for a little payback for a long time.
Well, you're gonna go on wanting! I won then,\nand I'll win today! My team's got you beat!
We... lost?!
Since when has Otomo had that much drive?!
Since when has Otomo had that much drive?!
You see that, Hyuga? That's the new Otomo!
Looks like I let you win again, Nitta...
Takeshi...
But don't expect it to always go your way.\nI'll see you again at next year's Nationals!
Wouldn't have it any other way!
The Final Night of the Junior Hero League
I can't sleep...
I'm wide awake...
It's finally here. Tomorrow's the day.
Yup. Our big showdown with Nankatsu.\nAnd we made it here undefeated.
Even if it's just an exhibition match, I never\nthought we'd get an opportunity like this.
And we won't get another one, so we have to make\nthis one count!
What's wrong, <avatar_name>? Why're you up so late?
I could ask you the same thing.\nWell, I guess we're all in the same boat.
Tomorrow's the day we've been\nworking toward all this time.
After all that effort, all of that training...\nWe have to win this!
What was this all for anyway?
Why do you want to beat them so bad?
Well, to put it simply... it's an obsession.
Well, to put it simply... it's an obsession.
Maybe you already know this, but back in\nelementary school the four of us won the\nchampionship with Nankatsu SC.
But, well, we didn't exactly stand out.
Now, Kisugi, Taki, Izawa, and Takasugi were picked\nas star players of the tournament. But we weren't.
We have some satisfaction that's owed us.\nThat's most of it to be honest.
I mean, it's not like they're bad players.\nIf anything, they're more talented than we are.\nThey were our teammates, and we know it.
But that's exactly why I need to win.
We wanna beat them BECAUSE they're better.\nThat's what keeps us coming back and staying\nlate at practice.
That's what all that intense training has been\nfor. I mean, how were we supposed to challenge\nthem if we only trained as hard as they did?
The only way to surpass someone better\nthan you is to put in more effort.\nThat became like our religion.
That's why this time we'll be the victors.\nThat's how we'll prove me, I mean, prove US right.
It's for you guys, too. You kept the faith\nand stuck it out when things got hard.
Besides, is there anything cooler than the\nunderdogs toppling the champs? No, there isn't!
Then, I'll win this!
Then, I'll clean them up good!
Good to hear!
Whoa there! Big words.\nBut I like the sound of that.
Anyway, it's getting late. We should head back.
Yeah, staying up all night can't be good for our\nbrains. Wouldn't want any of us to take a tumble\ntomorrow.
C'mon, let's go.
Let's play tomorrow like it's the\nlast game anyone's ever going to play!
Hey, I'm not going to let you steal\nthe spotlight this time, <avatar_name>!
Yeah, we're all in this together!
Guys...
Tomorrow, we're beating Nankatsu\nand redeeming ourselves from Regionals!
This time the third years\nfinally defeat Nankatsu. No doubts.
You mean WE do. Together.
So you're taking center stage?
You're right. We've adopted their dream, too!
Guilty as charged.
So, yeah. We'll make that dream a reality!\nTogether.
Thanks guys! We're counting on you!
Let's show Japan what we can do when we try!
YEAH!
Achoo!
Eh? Don't tell me you're catching a cold, Nitta.
I'm just a little chilly!\nAnyway, we should head back in.
Yeah.
Seeing them like that,\nI think Otomo's gonna be alright.
Yeah...
And not only Nitta and Ichijo, either.\n<avatar_name>'s made a bit of a name for himself,\ntoo.
That's for sure. He's been swapping\nstrats and training ideas with Nitta.
I heard from Ichijo that he's the one who\nsaid that they needed to support Nitta, too.
Who knows if the team would've\ncome together without him.
And that very rookie just\ntold us it was all for us.
It's not like we're gonna let him do it alone,\nare we?
Tomorrow's match is what the Otomo Soccer\nClub's been working toward for so long.
We have to give it 120%.
This time, "Defeat Nankatsu!"\nwill be more than a rallying cry.
Wham!
Tak!
Darn right!
All the way!
Under this azure summer sky,\nthe day has finally come.
Two teams will take the field, but only one will\nbe crowned champion of the Junior Hero League!\nWill it be Nankatsu or Otomo?
Nankatsu's captain Tsubasa Ozora was injured at\nNationals, but now looks to have returned\nfighting fit.
On the other side is Otomo MS, Nankatsu's old\nenemy from the Shizuoka Regionals. They put up\na good fight then, but it wasn't enough.
With their eye on revenge, their captain Urabe\nhas been working on his defense, while their ace\nstriker Nitta has polished his shot.
And what's more, Otomo is joined by a wild card\nfirst-year player, who has played a key role in\nthe team's success in this league!
Both of these teams have made it to this\nfinal match with a perfect win streak!
Now, this isn't just any exhibition!\nThe winners will be the top team in the league!\nThese are the League Finals!
It's almost time for the starting whistle, folks!
Hey, Tsubasa! Today's gonna be\npayback for the Regional Finals!
Oh, I'm looking forward to\nseeing what you can do, Nitta!
Let's play the kind of game that\ncauses you to burn deep inside!
You've got more to worry\nabout than just Nitta, y'know!
Tak! We're gonna leave you\ndumbstruck on the pitch!
And not just you, Tsubasa. Kisugi, Taki, Izawa...\nWe'll pin you down all at once!
This day belongs to Otomo!
Ha! Sure!
You really think we went through\nNationals without learning anything?
We'll leave your defense in tatters,\nand shred your net with our shots!
If you think you can catch me,\nyou've got another thing coming, Urabe!
In your dreams! Bring it on!
The bigger they are, the harder they fall!\nDon't underestimate Otomo MS!
Taking home the championship of the\nJunior Hero League with a perfect win streak,\nit's Shizuoka's own Otomo Middle School!
How... could I lose...?
I can't believe it. We...
We lost to Otomo...?
We lost to Otomo...?
We won...
We did it! We won!
We beat Nankatsu!
Yes! We did it, Captain!
Yeah... Yeah... We did it!
We beat Nankatsu! We beat Tsubasa!
We really won!
That's how you slay giants!
Yahoo!
I'm not dreaming, am I?
You know it!
It loses some cache to say it one's self, but...\nIt feels amazing to be thought weak,\nand then come out on top!
That's right! Let it out!
Then, me too!
Yah-Yahoo!
I feel silly, but I feel great, too!
Let's find out. Pinch me.
Owww! Not so hard!
Geez...
But that means we're safe! This is real!
Congrats guys. You won the league.
Tsubasa...
Look, when we dominated all three years at\nNationals, I figured I was done with Japan.\nI was going to move to Brazil and turn pro...
At least, that's what I thought.
...
I was mistaken. In my heart, I've gotten arrogant.
I could feel your spirit in that match.\nYou took us head on without flinching.\nI sensed how much you wanted that win.
Thanks, but we couldn't have done it without you.
Huh?
Because Nankatsu was so good. If you hadn't been\nour opponent, we never would've pushed ourselves\nso hard.
We made your strength ours.
That's where that champion's spirit came from.
Exactly. I was able to push myself\nharder because you set the bar so high.
So you put in the effort because you found some\nlofty aspirations, so to speak. I think I get it.
Thanks, you two.\nYou reminded me of something important.
I never want to lose to anyone\nin the game I love so much.
Which is why I need to keep giving it\nmy all without becoming conceited.
Congrats, Otomo. That was a knockout performance.
Tsubasa...!
And so, the Junior Hero League, an exhibition\nleague to choose who will represent Japan,\nhas finally come to a close.
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up\nfor the MVP of this tournament: the newcomer\nfrom Otomo, <avatar_name>!
New stars are raining down around us, folks!\nIt's this moment when our winners really get\nto feel like Junior Heroes!
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up\nfor the MVP of this tournament: the newcomer\nfrom Otomo, <avatar_name>!
Not only that, he's also the top scorer of the\ntournament. It's a miraculous double crown, folks!
What a meteoric rise for our star's debut!\nHe is certainly the kind of junior hero that\nthis league was named for!
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament: Otomo's ace striker,\nShun Nitta!
And the top-scoring player of the tournament\nis the newcomer from Otomo, <avatar_name>!
He earned recognition by sweeping past strikers,\nwhich is all the more impressive!
Before the closing ceremony, let's give it up for\nthe MVP of this tournament: the incredible captain\nof Otomo MS, Hanji Urabe!
And now, given the results of the Junior Hero\nLeague, 21 of the best players have been announced\nas Japan's national representatives!
From Otomo MS: Urabe, Nitta, and <avatar_name>!
These 21 players will represent Japan at an\nInternational Tournament to be held in America\nnext month!
This golden generation of soccer players will\nface off against the world's best! Take notice!
It's finally over...
Yeah, and we got the best possible ending!
Practicing day in and day out was\ntough, but it was all worth it.
...
What's wrong, Nitta?
My goal is to reach and surpass him, sure. But\nhaving another match made something really clear.
He set that bar way high. I mean, we may've won\nthis match, but there are still ways in which I\ndon't compare to him at all.
I've decided that even after he leaves for Brazil,\nI still want to pursue becoming as good if not\nbetter than he is.
Nitta...
Well, if anyone can do it, it's you!
Listen up, guys.
We accomplished our goal of defeating Nankatsu.
It may have just been an exhibition match,\nbut it was the best result we could've hoped for.\nAnd it's all thanks to your hard work.
As your captain, thank you. Thank you for\nfollowing someone like me to the ends of...\nWell, Japanese soccer.
Give yourself some credit, Captain!
We only made it this far because\nyou guys were doing so much for us!
We're the ones who should be thanking you! So...\nThank you!
Thank you!
Everyone...
But like I said, this was just an exhibition.\nWhat REALLY matters is next year's Nationals.
After this tournament, the whole country\nknows the beasts that we've become.
I bet we'll be seeing more than a few teams\nwith "Defeat Otomo!" as their new objective.
Which means we'll have plenty\nof rivals standing in our way.
But no matter who we come up against,\nnever forget that we're Otomo!
And next year, they'll be\ncheering OUR name at Nationals!
Tak!
You'll be captain by then, Nitta.\nWe're counting on you!
Right, leave it to me!
I'll be sure to bring out everyone's best and\ntake home that championship! Just you wait!
And Ichijo? <avatar_name>? The team's going to\nneed you, too. Nitta will need your support.
Nitta's got a bad habit of charging into things\nwithout thinking about how it might crack his\nskull.
But if you all work together,\nOtomo's got a bright future!
We won't let you down!
Maybe I should be leading then!
I'm not 100% confident, but I'll try.
Yup! I'm counting on you too, partner!
Whoa there! You bucked up in a hurry, <avatar_name>.
But that's exactly the attitude we'll need!\nCan't wait for next season, buddy!
C'mon <avatar_name>, show some fire!
I think you're incredible.\nBoth in terms of talent and the work you put in.
So just keep it up and I know\nyou'll be invaluable to the team!
Exactly! I'll be counting on you, partner!
(I'm expecting great things from you,\nCaptain Nitta!)
Yeah, that's the spirit!
You all have to make sure Nitta\ndoesn't leave you in the dust though!
Never forget that soccer's a team sport!
Racja!
One last thing... Congrats to Urabe, Nitta,\nand <avatar_name> for making it onto the\nAll-Japan team!
Oh, yeah! Thanks so much!
Well, Nitta was never in doubt.
I'm surprised Urabe and\n<avatar_name> made it though.
What'd you say?!
Well... I see your point.\nI'm probably even more shocked than you.
Never even imagined I'd get picked...
You're pretty incredible too, <avatar_name>.\nI can't believe you got picked to rep Japan\nbefore you even made it to starter for Otomo!
I'll be fighting for you guys out there!
With my skills? I was a shoe in.
I hope I know enough English...
Of course, you will! Knock 'em dead!
And while you're at it, might as well\nwin the whole thing, right?
And it's already going to his head!
But you've got the skills to back it up, right?\nShow 'em the old Otomo spirit!
Oh, right.\nThe tournament's being held in America, huh?
Don't worry, Urabe's English sounds\nlike a violin being run over by a bus.
Hey, I'm standing right here!
I mean, yeah maybe it does a little...\nBut I'm at least better than a first year student.
So we'll have to practice English, too?\nUgh, why can't we just stick to soccer?
Anyway, good luck you three!\nRemember that you're representing us out there!
Don't worry! We won't let you down!
I know you can do it!
Go out there and show the world\njust how spectacular we can be!
We'll definitely be watching your games!
Thank you! And we'll let you hold the\nchampionship cup when we bring it home!
...
[Defeat Nankatsu!]
Go!
Run! Run!
C'mon! Keep your eyes on the ball!
Move further up!
Takeshi!
Wakashimazu!
Even the first and second years are getting\nreally pumped up these days, huh?
Of course, they are!
The Toho Academy Soccer Club just won the\nMiddle School Nationals! We're number one!
We can't let our level of play slip\neven a little! Next stop, consecutive\nchampionship victories!
I'm on board for that.
Wait, where's Hyuga anyway?
Isn't he still in the clubroom?
Hmm... Do you think he's satisfied now?\nNow that we won?
Doubt it.
Hyuga will never be satisfied.
...
He's already got his eyes on his next goal.
Oh, that's for sure! I bet he's already thinking\nabout being number one in high sch-
This'll be rough.
Hmmm?
*pant* *pant*
Until now, we've always been the challengers...\nThe ones doing the chasing.
But we're the best in Japan now.\nFrom here on out I don't...
(Going forward... I'll KEEP playing\nmy way! So basically...)
I don't...
...need this anymore!
They'll be coming for us.
But I'm going to keep playing\nthe same as I always have.
Get in there!
"Junior Hero League"? The heck's that?
Um, well...
Next month America's hosting an\nInternational Tournament for youth teams,\nand Japan's going to be taking part, so...
They're holding an exhibition league to choose\nwhich players are going to represent Japan.
Gotcha. Basically, they'll be qualifier matches.
Yeah.
I just heard from our substitute coach that\nthe school accepted an invitation from\nthe Soccer Association to take part.
So, ya think they'll let us third years play, too?
Why wouldn't they? I heard they were\nletting anyone in, regardless of year.
I see... Qualifiers...
Hey, Sorimachi. Did they say\nwhat schools would be there?
They didn't list all of 'em, but y'know\nanyone good will be. I'd expect\nNankatsu and Furano for sure.
...!
Nankatsu, huh? Which means... Tsubasa!
Yeah. I can't see him passing this up.
Think they've already drawn up the brackets?
I dunno... Let's ask coach.
...
Hyuga?
Go get the whole team together, Takeshi. ASAP.
Y-You got it!
...So basically, we're gonna take part\nin this Junior Hero League thing.
So they wanna choose players to rep Japan\nfor some new tournament, but all in all\nit's basically an exhibition match.
But there's no reason not to play our best! We\njust won Nationals! We're the best team in Japan!
There's no reason for us to lose, even in\nan exhibition! Ain't that right, guys?!
Racja!
For the past two years, we've been\ntrainin' our butts off to beat Nankatsu.
But now WE'RE the champions.\nAnd we've got a new goal.
And that's to crush all challengers! We climbed\nto the top, and we're defending our throne!
Which is why... We're winnin'\nthis Junior Hero League, too!
Toho Academy soccer will reign over\nall of Japanese soccer! Got that?!
Loud and clear!
I got an overview of the League,\nplus the match-ups.
Great, let's see it.
Okay... Looks like there are fourteen teams\nin all, each playing seven league matches.
So who's in Toho's bracket?
Um... Nankatsu... Musashi... Furano...
They probably matched up the teams with\nsimilar skill levels to help choose the reps.
Can we really win all our matches\nagainst a line-up like that though?
Heh. What fun would it be if\nit were easy? I can't wait.
Actually... I've been thinking\nabout something, Captain.
What?
Back at Nationals, we were evenly\nmatched with Tsubasa and Nankatsu.\nWe became champions together.
And in this new League, we'll be facing\nNankatsu on the last day, in the last match.\nAnd Tsubasa will be back to fighting fit by then.
So if you think about it... We'll need to be\neven better than before to beat him this time.
You're right... With Tsubasa in top form,\nNankatsu'll be a tier or two better\nthan last time.
I just said our goal wasn't just\nto beat Nankatsu anymore, but...
If we wanna win this thing,\nthat's how it's gotta happen.
...
Hey, I've got an idea, Hyuga.
Yeah? Let's hear it.
Obviously, we're going to have to get better\nif we want to beat Nankatsu at their best...
But there's something we can do, too.\nHow about we add some fresh blood to the team,\nand find some good, new players?
Toho Academy's got plenty of talent besides us.\nIf any of the second or third stringers has\ngot potential, I think it'd be a good idea.
Sounds good to me. Could be a nice way to light\na fire under the butts of us third-years, too.
Yeah, just imagine how motivated we'd be\nif we had to compete not only to be a regular,\nbut just to sit on the bench.
Definitely. I'm sure plenty of others in\nour school club would fight for that chance.
Exactly. So why don't we round everyone up\nand give them a little trial?
...
Sure. Sounds like a plan.
Alright, Takeshi, why don't you go ask the\nsubstitute coach about it?
You got it!
Takeshi's really thinking about\nhow to improve the team.
Absolutely. And that's great and all, but...
I think Takeshi's idea means somethin' else\nto the rest of us. Somethin' just as important.
Huh?
Are you talking about next year?
Yup. And even after that.
What d'you mean?
Right now we're the champs,\nbut all of us third years are about to graduate.
When that happens, Takeshi'll be in charge.\nBut it's not like he can fill in for us\ncompletely on his own.
Yeah, I see. That's a lot of a responsibility.
So we've got to find and train up the club\nmembers who are gonna step in when we ship out.
Makes sense.
Now that we're the champs, everyone'll\nbe gunning for us next year.
Yeah... I guess you're right.
That's our duty as team leaders at a top school.
The league itself is just an exhibition; but\nsince they'll be choosing reps for the big\ntournament, everyone there'll be motivated.
It'll be a nice chance for the rookies\nto get some real experience.
(Yeah, there's that, too...)
(But this ain't just about Toho.)
(This is big for Takeshi, personally...)
I talked to the coach, Hyuga.
I think it's a great idea!\nI'm itching to put it into action!
Alright!
Gather everyone together, Takeshi!
Racja!
The next day...
Alright guys, this is your chance\nto move up in the world.
The first test will be to go one-on-one\nwith Koike and the other regulars.
Your results here will determine\nwhether you move on the next test or not.
Now listen up. I don't wanna hear\nany excuses about how this is too sudden,\nor you couldn't prepare or whatever.
As long as you've been trainin'\nevery day thinkin' you wanna be\na regular someday, you'll do fine.
And now you've got your chance!\nDon't let it slip away!
Right, Captain!
How could you fall for such a simple feint?!\nRead more into the play!
You're too predictable! Once they\nget a read on you, you're an easy mark!
A tackle like that'd never cut it in a real match!
I really like the look of these guys.\nGood attitude.
I mean, they might get to become first stringers.\n'Course they're gonna be throwin' themselves\nat that opportunity.
But... It's still not enough.
No, look, it's too soon to say that.
Hmm?
See? That first year's going\nhead-to-head with Koike.
I've got you now!
You won't get past me with that!
Wait, what?! Why you little...!
Huh. Not bad.
He's got some moves if he can\njust steal the ball from Koike.
You gotta point.
Looks like he's a first year.\nYou know him, Takeshi?
I wouldn't say I know him exactly,\nbut we talked a couple of times when\nwe first joined the club.
His name is...
...
Keep an eye on that first year, Wakashimazu.
Got it.
Okay guys, that's enough!
If I call out your name, stick around!\nWe'll move right on the next challenge!
For the second test, you'll be playing\nalongside the regulars in a practice game.
We'll be watching you from here\nto make our final decision. Good luck!
Hey, <avatar_name>!\nWe haven't spoken in a while, have we?
Yeah, it's really been a while, huh?
I'm honored you even remembered me!
...Good to see you.
Don't tell me I'm a regular now?
It has. Good to see you're doing well.
Ha ha, don't be like that!\nWe're both first years, aren't we?
Huh? Don't tell me you're nervous about the tests.
Times like these, you should be putting\non a brave face! Yell at the top of your lungs,\nand let the world know how awesome you are!
Ha ha, well, it's still too soon to say.\nI mean, you've gotta pass this next trial.
But still, I'm surprised another first year\neven made it this far. I'd love it\nif you made it as a regular.
So, uh, what was your position again?
Forward, right?
Midfielder, right?
Defender, right?
I'm sure you know this already, but we're pretty\ncompetitive at Toho. You'll never make it unless\nthe coach acknowledges your skills, too.
But right here... This is the best shot\nyou'll ever get, so I really hope you'll\ntake full advantage of it.
<avatar_name>. You'll be on Takeshi's team.
Well, you heard him.
Alright! Can't wait to see you in action!
If you get chosen, we'll have another\nfirst-year on the team! Zróbmy to!
I hate to say this, but only one\nof you passed the second test.
But that's no reason to lose hope.\nYou'll have other opportunities in the future.
So keep on training to be ready for the next time!
Anyway, the only one who passed the test is...
<avatar_name>!
You did it! I knew you could!
As far as I was concerned, when you got that\nball from me, I figured you were good to go.
Good to have you with us!
I've got high hopes for you!
Hey <avatar_name>. I'm the captain, Hyuga.
Let me be up front with you. There's a new\nleague tournament comin' up, and we did this to\nget some fresh blood pumping in the team's veins.
That was the point of these challenges.
Obviously, Toho Academy just won at Nationals.\nWe're the champs now.
What that means is no matter how tough\nthe other team is, we ain't allowed to lose.
And as one of us, that commitment to victory\nmeans a lotta blood, sweat, and tears on the\npitch... Not sunshine and rainbows.
But don't worry. We're here to make each\nother stronger, and you won't be left out.
Plus, they're gonna be choosin' players for a\nteam reppin' Japan in an International Tournament\nat the next tourney, too. Maybe they'll pick you.
So listen up, <avatar_name>. Right now,\nI want ya to come at us with everythin' y'got!
Bring it on!
I'm not sure about this...
Time to go represent Japan!
Just what I like to hear!
What's the matter, <avatar_name>?\nYou're pretty brave when you're playing.
Don't worry, we've got your back!
Whoa there, maybe that's a little TOO confident.
Ha ha ha... Well, keep practicin' and who knows?
Okay, with that outta the way,\nlet's get right to practice!
Obviously the plan's to win the\nJunior Hero League! Now, let's get crackin'!
Right, Captain!
Junior Hero League: First Day.
Never thought we'd be back here so soon...
It hasn't been that long since the finals with\nNankatsu, but it already feels like so long ago.
I'm just glad I get another chance\nto play with you guys.
I was so sure that was going\nto be our final game together!
...
Plus, <avatar_name> even managed\nto stick around on the bench.
You've been training pretty hard, <avatar_name>.\nFeelin' okay? Not sore or anything?
Never been better!
It sure is different on the main team.
I just wish I could've done even more!
Good to hear.
Just the thought that we're going to be playing\ntogether from here on out gets me so excited!
We're expecting great things from you,\n<avatar_name>!
Yeah, I get that.\nI found it pretty tough at first, too.
Plus, Hyuga's merciless. He reminds me\nof those drill sergeants you see on TV.
I heard that, Takeshi!
Eep! Oh hey, Hyuga, didn't see you there!
If you got the energy to flap your jaw like that,\nthen you got the energy to keep training!
If you wanna get better, grit your teeth\nand keep up, got it?!
Crazy, ain't he? Our training regime is said\nto be one of the harshest in the country.
If you're not sore yet, you're gonna be!\nThis'll all pay off in the end!
Being able to play hard day in and day out is\njust another kind of talent! Learn to love it!
Let's get going, guys.\nIt's about time for the opening ceremony.
Sure thing!
The opening ceremony for the\nJunior Hero League sponsored by the\nSoccer Association will commence shortly.
Starting just this month, the best teams from\nNationals and even various Regionals have\ngathered. But this is no mere exhibition.
The known goal of these games is that\nthey will determine the players for the\nInternational Tournament in America next month!
While the top schools facing off is one thing,\nindividual play will also be important. The top\nplayers are competing to represent our nation!
Who from among these teams will be chosen to\nstand as heroes representing all of Japan?
And here come the players now!
We made it in time... somehow.
I'm impressed you were able to organize this\non such short notice.
You and me both.
It was only possible thanks to all the\nparticipating schools being so understanding.
I still can't believe the French International\nwas canceled and replaced with the\nJunior Youth World Challenge.
And there's also the inclusion of even more\nridiculously skilled teams from over the world...
The training camp... The European tour... All\nthose carefully laid plans just went up in smoke.
Yeah.
Every match is an opportunity\nfor a player to grow.
Exactly. That's why this\nJunior Hero League is so important.
Knowing that this isn't just an exhibition, but\nthat we're selecting players to represent Japan,\nshould inspire everyone to do their best.
Hopefully, the players can build on the potential\nthey showed at Nationals.
The Junior Hero League is a chance for us\nto see their growth in action.
That's definitely an added benefit to this.
We will have aided them in developing the kind of\nskill it takes to compete on the world stage.
Indeed. We've done our part.\nNow, we just have to believe in them.
It's time, guys.\nThe Junior Hero League is starting. You ready?
We were born ready!
From here on out, we're facing nothin' but the\nbest. We may be the champs, but it won't be easy.
If anythin', they'll all be chompin' at the bit\nfor a chance to take us down. So don't get sloppy!
Got it!
Alright! We're Toho Academy! We play to win!\nLet's show 'em how the champs do things!
Right on!
<avatar_name>.
By makin' it to the bench, you've taken\nyour first major step as a Toho Academy player.
So how's it feel? Got butterflies?
I'm too excited to be nervous!
N-No! I'm not nervous!
What about you? Are you nervous?
Good attitude, kid.
Don't forget that there's no room for weakness.\nOnce you're out there, y'gotta get serious!
Like I'm gonna believe that\nwhen you're stutterin'.
Listen up. Once the match starts,\nyou won't have TIME to chicken out.
The most important thing in soccer is\nyour attitude! You gotta know, deep down,\nthat you can overcome any challenge!
Me?
Heh. Don't be dumb. Like I'd be\nnervous over a little thing like this.
To win in soccer, you gotta bring the\nbattle to the other team with all your heart.\nRemember that, rookie!
Yo, Hyuga!
Sawaki...?
We didn't get to play each other at nationals,\nso I'm really looking forward to this!
We've been studying how to take you guys\ndown ever since they announced the League.
That means all of you!\nHyuga, Sawada, Wakashimazu...!\nI hope you're ready to eat some dust!
I don't think so!
I think you got that backwards!
I'm the one with a score to settle...\nYou're not scoring a single point this time!
Listen here, <avatar_name>.
The league tournament is gonna be\nall killers, man. We're talkin' all\nthe best teams from Nationals.
If we can kick a little butt,\nwe're gonna turn a lotta heads.
And when that happens, other players'll be lining\nup to meet us, and we can learn from one another.
Toss in a couple of rivals for competition,\nand your skill level will skyrocket.
Time to get out there!
Listen up.

Time to get out there!
Man!
You guys really have been training hard, huh?
Sawaki...
That's my line, Sawaki.\nYou certainly didn't make that easy.
Naturally, that's what happens when\nyou train under Coach Kira.
Heh, same to you, Hyuga.
I hate to admit it, but we lost fair and square.\nYou guys are a solid team.
And you guys are, too.\nI saw you reading my moves earlier.
I've gotta start paying more\nattention to what I'm doing next match.
Guess that's what makes you a champion team.\nAlways looking to improve.
But this is just the beginning\nof the League! Good luck!
You too!
Hyuga's the same as ever, huh?
Hmm?
Even back in Meiwa FC, he used to lead\nfrom the front. The captain, dragging us to\nvictory behind him.
I thought he'd matured since then, but...\nI guess he's still the same guy, deep down.
Yo. You're Kojiro Hyuga, right?
Yeah. And you're... Ishida? And the guy\nwith you is Takei, the forward, right?
Heh, I'm surprised the number one\nmiddle school striker even remembers us.
That'll make beating you\nhere all the more worthwhile.
When we beat Toho here, then we'll be standing\nshoulder to shoulder with the best in the country.
We've decided we're winning today, after all.
Hmph. You're welcome to try. You're not the first\nchallengers we will have driven beneath our heels,\nand you won't be the last!
Tak! There's no way we're losing to you!
We did it, Hyuga!
Naturally.
Agh! So we still lost!
That Kojiro Hyuga is crazy good...
I thought we could just keep him marked\nso he'd never be open, but then the rest of\nthe team just ran right over us.
There's definitely a gap between our teams.
That's not all, Ishida.
Huh?
The key is to Toho's strength is definitely\nHyuga. He's fully dedicated to victory.
It's only because we believe in him that\nwe can coordinate so well. That's our strength.
I see... I'll keep that in mind.
But the League's just getting started.\nGood luck in your next match!
Yeah, same to you.
...
Did something happen, Ishida?\nYou seem... happy.
Heh, it's nothing. Just found a bit\nof inspiration. Something to aspire to.
(As the captain, I learned how to\nlead a team from you, Hyuga.)
(And once we're in high school, it's on!)
I-I'm beat...
It's pretty far from... one end of the field\nto the other... when you're sprinting...
Hey, what's wrong?!
If you're already out of breath,\nthen I guess you need more training!
Ten more wind sprints! Go go go!
The captain's really got some\ntree-trunk legs, huh...?
But we're not going to let him leave\nus in the dust, are we? Idziemy!
Tak!
Yeah, that's it, <avatar_name>!
Over here, <avatar_name>! Pass it here!
Here you go, Furuta!
I'll dribble it myself!
Too slow!
Pick up the pace!
A laid-back attitude like that won't cut it in\nthe big leagues, <avatar_name>! Stop hesitating!
Don't expect them to start off slow with ya\nin a real match because you're a first-year!
Takeshi! Switch with him!
On it!
The captain's right, <avatar_name>.
It's too late to think about what you'll\ndo next after you've already got the ball.
Now that you're on the bench, I want\nyou to pay close attention to both teams.
You have to know everyone's habits as\nthey're passing, how they pursue the ball, and\nhow hard they kick when doing a side change.
Once you've got all that down, you'll\nbe much quicker at figuring out what to do\nin your own plays.
In a real match, you won't have time to check\nwhere everyone is. So you have to drill it into\nyour head in practice. Instinctively, you'll know.
Got it!
Can I even do that?
Good answer.
It's not a matter of "can" or "can't."\nYou'll do it because you have to.
As of now, you're playing with the big boys.\nOf course, we're going to expect a lot from you.
If you don't want to get dumped back in with\nthe second-stringers, play like your life\ndepends on it! Got it?
Okay, <avatar_name>! Time to go again!\nGet over here!
See? Good luck!
Okay! That's enough team practice for today!
Cool off and get some rest!
Hey, good work out there, <avatar_name>!
I-I'm exhausted...
I'm starving...
I could barely keep up...
Heh, yeah. But to Hyuga and Wakashimazu\nand the rest, this was just any other day.
And they have to pay attention to everyone else,\ntoo. You know, watch how everyone's doing,\nand do callouts and stuff.
If you ever want to catch up with people like\nthat, first you have to get to the point where\nthis level of training is just standard procedure.
Huh?
Guess I'm pretty hungry, too.\nI wonder what's for dinner today.
But you're tougher than I thought.\nSo you're hungry but not tired?
With that spirit, you'll be a\nfirst-stringer in no time at all.
Yeah, I get you. I was like that at first, too.\nIt was all I could do to try and keep up\nwith everyone else.
And I know you were getting yelled at all day,\nbut I get barked at plenty, too.\nLike, "Too slow, Takeshi! Move faster!"
But they only do it because they see your\npotential. That's just how much they believe\nin you. Y'know... Probably.
Oh, I know, how about we go for a run together\nafter dinner?
It'll be outside of school,\nbut I know the perfect route for us.
Sure!
More training?!
Great! See you then!
What'd you expect?
Team practice is over, so it's\ntime for individual practice.
I mean, if you really don't want to, that's\nfine, too, but you'll never make it to the top.
So come on, let's do this together!
Sorry for the wait, <avatar_name>.
Okay, let's get started!
Phew... I'm beat...
I guess after this I'll just take a bath\nand hit the sack. Then, I'm back at it tomorrow.
Hey, is that...?
Ugh... Even after all this training,\nI still can't even touch the ball?!
You're just gettin' sloppy cuz you're tired,\nWakashimazu. How about we call it a night?
No! I can do this! Just...\nJust give me a little more time!
Fine, fine... Hmm?
Hey, Takeshi! <avatar_name>!
Heading back from your usual run?
Yup. I brought <avatar_name> with me today, too.
That so?
I betcha know this already, <avatar_name>,\nbut Takeshi made it to the regulars even as\na first-year.
Age doesn't matter in soccer.\nAll that matters is if you benefit the team.
So you'd better aim to be a\nplayer like that, too. Got it?!
Y-Yessir!
I'll work hard enough to be a rep!
That's the spirit! Always be\nthinking about helping your team win!
If you want to prove yourself to the judges,\nyou'd better prove yourself to us first.
Until you can do that, being chosen\nas a rep will remain outta reach.
Anyway, we'll be out here a little longer,\nso you two go get some rest.
Racja! Please excuse us!
See you tomorrow!
It's been a while, Hyuga.
You're... Nitta, right?
Weren't you that cheeky brat I met in Shizuoka?
Cheeky? Y'could be a little less blunt about it.
Well, you did end up winning Nationals, so I\nguess I can't tell you to shut-up until you're\nnumber one, anymore.
But if we can take ya down now, Mr. Champ,\nthen all the more glory for us.
Why you little...
Nitta.
Yo, Takeshi. Haven't seen you\nsince I crushed you in elementary school.
I still owe you that debt...\nToday, I think payment's coming due.
Bring it on. I'd love to have a rematch with you.
We haven't played each other since\nelementary school either, have we Hyuga?
Urabe...
We know just how good you are at breaking through\ndefenses, so our team has worked diligently\nto be able to shut you down together.
Today's the day you meet your match\nagainst the Otomo Quartet!
We won't be holding back, you two!
Jeez, is taunting us really so fun?\nAll these guys are yappy as chihuahuas.
But fine. We'll show 'em what we've got, Takeshi!
For sure!
Whoa, so this is Toho Academy...!
Oof, now I know why they're number one!
My debt's repaid, Nitta.
I'll see you in next year's Nationals...\nWhere we'll be winning again.
Getting cocky, eh, Takeshi?
But can you even make it past the\nTokyo regionals without your third-years?
Ugh... That's...
Nitta.
My bad. Just got a little hot-headed.
Hyuga. I learned a lot from your style of soccer,\nand I see how to get the most out of\na single superstar player.
And I'll make sure Nitta and Ichijo\nremember it well, next year.
Next year, huh...? Guess it's the same everywhere.
Well, good luck with your next match, Hyuga.
Yeah, same to you.
Tsubasa Ozora and then Kojiro Hyuga... Why do my\ngoals always have to be so far out of reach?
What? You thinking of throwing in the towel?
Ha, no way. If anything, I'm even more into\nit now. I can't wait to play them again!
Yo, Hyuga.
I don't think we've met since the prelims\nfor the elementary school Nationals.
Back then we were tied,\nbut this time we're winning!
Heh. We LET you tie, so Nankatsu\ncould make it to the finals.
What was that?!
But today we ain't worrying about any\nof that "strategy" stuff. The best players win,\nand that's all there is to it!
Ha! Is that what you think?
Maybe you're better than us on the ground,\nbut just try and catch us midair!
And that's all there is to it!\nWe'll win with our patented aerial soccer!
Doesn't matter where you shoot from!\nThe ball isn't going in our net. Not even once.
Heh. We'll be smashing through\nwhatever wall you put up, Wakashimazu!
I hope you're ready!
Just leave it to me, Hyuga.
It doesn't matter what fancy\nacrobatics they use, I'll stop them!
I know.
You give the orders to the defensive line, too.\nCountin' on you, Wakashimazu!
You got it!
Ugh, we lost...
I knew Hyuga was good, but that\ncombo with Takeshi was something else.
It's not like your combo shots were bad either.
Especially that aerial soccer of yours...\nWe could never manage that.
They say "freedom" is important in soccer,\nbut with how far you take it, your style might\nembody that idea more than any other.
Whoa, thanks!
Still, you've sure got it rough Takeshi.\nWhat are you gonna do next year without\nHyuga or Wakashimazu?
Huh? Uh, yeah...
The Tokyo regionals are pretty competitive,\nbut it's not like the champs can afford not\nto make it through, right?
...
...
Whoops, we better get going. We'll get in the way\nof the next match if we stick around too long.
See you later! I hope we can meet again as reps!
Yeah. Lookin' forward to it.
Hey, Masao?
Yeah?
Think I was too harsh on Takeshi? Maybe he\ndoesn't need that kinda pressure from an outsider.
Don't worry about it.
He made himself the key to Toho's midfield even\nas a first-year. He's strong enough to take it.
All right! Let's split into\nteams for a practice match!
But wait, the captain's not here yet.
Oh right, didn't he say he'd be doing weight\ntraining after lunch? He left for the weight room.
Then, let's just get started without him for now.
Right. When he gets back he\ncan just join one of the sides.
It's yours, <avatar_name>!
Pass to the guy moving up the side.
Start dribbling immediately.
For now, think about it after you get the ball.
I'll take that!
Darn it...
Great job, <avatar_name>! That's the stuff!
(He's already putting the advice I gave him\ninto practice. The captain's got a good eye!)
Got it!
Gah...
Great job, <avatar_name>! That's the stuff!
(He's already putting the advice I gave him\ninto practice. The captain's got a good eye!)
Mine!
(Hmm. He's not using the advice I gave him...\nIs it still too difficult for him?)
(Nitta was right.)
(Kazuo Tachibana was right.)
(The third-years will be graduating soon.)
(And when that happens,\nI'll have to lead this team.)
Let's give 'em the old one-two, Takeshi!
Takeshi?!
(Next year, I'll have to be the one\nstanding in front, leading us to victory.)
(Just like Hyuga!)
You're mine!
Watch out, Takeshi!
Ow ow ow...
Sorry Takeshi. Y'all right?
Ah, yeah... Sorry about that.
What're you apologizing for? These things happen.
Ow!
Ouch, looks like you got a pretty bad scrape when\nyou fell. We should at least get it disinfected.
Hold still, I'll go grab the first-aid kit.
Oops, looks like we're all out of disinfectant.
Sorry, <avatar_name>, can you\ngo grab some antiseptic for us?
Ouch...!
(Ugh! I can't believe a wimpy\ntackle like that actually hurt me.)
(But it's not like I can just\nsit out at a time like this.)
(No little scrape is going\nto rob me of my victory!)
<avatar_name>...!
Are you injured, Hyuga?
Why's your ankle wrapped up?
Well, it's nothin'...
Had a little accident last match.
But forget about me, were you hurt in practice?
We ran out of disinfectant.
Takeshi got hurt.
Then grab some and get your butt back to practice.
I see... So you came to get disinfectant, huh?
Then grab some and get your butt back to practice.
Hey, <avatar_name>!
Don't go tellin' anyone what you saw here, okay?
Oh, here he is. Thanks!
What's wrong, <avatar_name>...?
Actually, I saw Hyuga...
No, it’s nothing.
Yo, sorry for the wait.
Hyuga!
I'll be joining in, too. Next match.
Gotcha!
(Right, next year I'll be in that spot...\nI'll have to lead the team like Hyuga does!)
Hey, <avatar_name>.\nI thought I told not to tell anyone!
Seriously, you'd better not! Or else!
Listen up, <avatar_name>, I'll say this one last\ntime. You'd better not tell anyone, or else!
Wakashimazu, seems like\nyour reactions are gettin' faster.
Huh? I guess...
(No, it's not that I'm getting better,\nit's that you're playing worse, Captain...)
Okay, one more time!
...!
...!
So you finally got it, huh?
But I knew you had it in you. If you can stop\nmy Tiger Shot, then nothin's getting past you!
Concentrate on the sensation,\nand we'll do it one more time!
...
Wakashimazu?
Sorry Captain, my left\nshoulder's feeling a little off.
Your left... You mean that old injury?
Then, I guess that's enough for now.
Okay, let's get this place cleaned up.
Yeah.
(It might've just been practice, but I've faced\nhundreds of his Tiger Shots, so I can tell.)
(It's not like there was anything wrong with his\nform, but the usual power just wasn't there.)
(That's the only reason I did so well,\nand finally managed to stop one.)
(Don't tell me there's something\nwrong with his leg...?)
So you're Hyuga, huh? I see, I see...
I can see why they call ya the Fierce Tiger.\nI can feel your burning spirit from all the\nway over here.
It's gonna be great declawing you!
Soda the Ace Killer, huh?\nGuess that means you're gonna be marking me?
You know it. Sorry, but you'll\nget no breathing room from me today!
I'll definitely stop you!\nI'll bet the name of "Ace Killer" on it!
Hmph. Bet whatever you like... Just know that I\nhave no concept of mercy, so I've none to show.
I'll show you that the\nFierce Tiger isn't just a nickname!
Fine, I lost. Toho really is incredible.
Even if I stopped you, the rest of your team\nwould tear up the field. Can't help that.
Exactly! That's our strength, right Hyuga?
I guess...
Hyuga?
But still, you're pretty incredible yourself,\nHyuga! Movin' around like that even when\nI'm marking you!
Hmph. Your defense wasn't bad...\nIt just wasn't enough to stop me.
Hah, thought you might say that...
But, well, any clever jab I say now\nwould just sound like I'm a sore loser.
Anyway, just keep on winning.\nI'll see ya on the Japanese team.
Lookin' forward to it.
(So Toho's real strength is that they ain't\njust supportin' their ace, but can play\nwithout him, too...)
(Not that it's any easier to get together a whole\nteam who are that good at their positions...)
(If I had someone as good as me\nto play defense, I guess I could play\na little more aggressively...)
Yo, Hyuga!
You've no idea how I've been waitin' for this\nday. Ain't nothin' better than goin' toe-to-toe\nwith someone who can fight back!
Your strength is unreal, Jito.\nI saw you at Nationals.
Tiger though you may be,\nyou're far from the jungle.
Even with a big guy like you,\nmy Tiger Shot will rip you to shreds!
Heh. Big talker!
I hardened up plenty from Nationals!\nGetting knocked around, even by Tsubasa's\nDrive Shot, ain't happenin' again!
You won't be able to get\npast my Power Defense, Hyuga!
When this's over, m'gonna\nbe laughin' all the way home!
You heard 'im. Prepare yourselves!
Well, at the very least,\nI'll make sure to have fun! Bahahaha!
That's no empty threat. Jito's Power Defense\nhas been proven time and time again at Nationals.\nBe careful, Hyuga.
Don't worry, Takeshi.\nI didn't come this far just to lose here.
Today, we're going home winners!\nLet's do it!
Tak!
Even with my brute strength, I couldn't keep up\nwith you guys! No denyin' Toho Academy knows\nwhat they're doin'!
Nice job keeping Hyuga occupied!\nThe rest of us were able to run right past him!
Watch out! Hyuga's blocked,\nbut keep eyes on the other players!
That's what we're good at, Captain!
...Yeah.
Captain?
And y'did all that even when I'm bigger than you!\nYour strength is incredible, Hyuga.
You're strong, too.\nJust not strong enough to stop me.
...Wish I was the one saying that.\nStill, ya don't hafta try'n coddle me.
The winner earns a frank admission of\ndefeat from the loser. That's the way it works.
Keep up your winning streak, Hyuga.\nI'll see you on the All-Japan Team!
Lookin' forward to it.
Ah, Sano... I'm feelin' optimistic!
Huh?
We're lucky to share the field with so many who\nhave the tenacity to make us work for victory.
C'mon, let's go home and practice!\nWe can still be stronger!
By this time next year,\nyou'll be the best in all of Japan!
Okay!
Am I just imagining it or\nam I more tired every time?
You're not. We run longer each time.
It's all vets now.\nThings'll only get more serious.
They see us differently now, eh?
It's more than that. After that match, you can\ntell they take us seriously as challengers now.
The whole team was more fired up\nmore than usual taking on Nankatsu!
I guess that's what it means to be number one!
Their captain... Whew!
And their defense is seriously on point.
Everyone! Keep moving!
(That Takeshi, does he even\nsee how hard his own team is working?)
Racja! Let's get some practice kicks in!
Furuta! Imai! More to the right!
Great... The captain's free kick wall...
I'm not as scared this time...
Hey! You two listen up.
<avatar_name>, break right.\nTakeshi, fake a shot, then pass to me.
Got it!
Idziemy!
Oh no! This way!
The wall's down... Now!
Hyuga!
Wha?!
Mine!
Ha...!
Gah...!
Lucky...
Sorry, Hyuga. My pass...
It's not your fault. I was overconfident.
(My foot's worse than I thought.)
(I knew it. My ankle's worse\nafter that scuffle with Soda.)
(I knew it. My ankle's worse\nafter that scuffle with Jito.)
(Captain, what's wrong?)
Right... that's enough practice for today!
Go home! And don't wear\nyourselves out practicing alone!
Let's go running tonight!
You wanna train tonight?
No can do. Some second-stringers\nasked me to help them.
Sorry bud! Next time!
Sorry! I promised some\nsecond-stringers I'd help them.
Next time! We'll go running!
Pretty sure Takeshi knows.
Hey <avatar_name>!
Wakashimazu’s going to the doc for that old\nshoulder injury. Tonight you train with me!
Meet back at the field after dinner. Got it?
You and me, one-one-one! See ya there!
Bring it on, <avatar_name>!
Try and take it back!
I'm going for it!
I need to finesse this.
That's the spirit!
That drive to win, to own\nthe ball, that's your edge.
You think fancy footwork will get this from me?
You're good, but not that good. I see you coming.\nYou're strength is something else.
You lose that ball, you don't stop until\nyou get it back. That's the edge that got\nyou through trials.
I wanted that on the field.\nThat's why I put you on the regular team.
Got it?! Learn all the techniques,\nbut don't forget to bring that fire!
(Sigh. I gotta tell the\ncaptain what the doc said.)
(Huh? There's someone in the locker room?)
I forgot my... There's my sports drink!
Oh yeah...
Phew...
Soda is great when it's hot, but after\npractice nothing beats a sports drink.
Hey <avatar_name>, thanks for\nnot telling anyone about my leg.
I didn't want anyone to know, but...
I'm trusting you, okay?
Why push yourself so hard?
Can you do this on your own?
There's much to be done.
That's what you came to say, huh?
So we can win, of course.
I've been playing soccer since elementary school.\nMy goal has been to beat Tsubasa and Nankatsu.
Through elementary school and\nmiddle school, we never beat them.
I was soft, playing with these\npampered kids at Toho Academy.
After the Tokyo regionals, my old elementary\nschool teacher Kira pulled me aside and said\n"You'll never beat Tsubasa like this."
I was shocked... It hit me hard.
So, I left the team before Nationals\nand went with Kira to train in Okinawa.
In Okinawa, I trained hard\nand overcame my weakness.
I was captain. And I shouldn't\nhave abandoned the team cause I felt like it.
So the coach benched me.\nI couldn't play in the Nationals.
You weren't on the team then but I'm sure\nyou've heard the rumors? They're all true...
It's wrong for a captain to\nabandon his team. No question.
I couldn't blame them if I had\nbeen disqualified entirely.
But they believed in me. And waited for me.
What's more, they went to the coach and\nbegged him to let me play in the tournament.
My rivalry with Tsubasa and\nNankatsu got me over my own wall.
And it's thanks to everyone I'm still here at all.
I owe everyone for what they did for me.\nThat's why I do this.
I vowed to win for this team by scoring the\nfinal goal with my own feet in the league match.
That's why this pain is irrelevant.
I've probably said more than I should...
Who's there?
C-Captain. I just got back.
Wakashimazu... How's the shoulder?
Uh yeah, no problem at all.
That's good.
I'm heading back to the dorms to hit the hay.
(I'm sorry for eaves dropping, Captain.)
(But... Knowing you're doing so much for us...)
For this training we'll go two-on-two.
It'll be me and <avatar_name> against Takeshi\nand Sorimachi. We'll each be trying to score\non Wakashimazu.
We'll take defense first, and Takeshi\nand Sorimachi can start on offense.
We switch whenever Wakashimazu catches\nthe ball, or if it goes out of bounds.
Whoever scores first wins!
Here we go!
That's enough!
Alright, <avatar_name>!
Looks like you're hiding\nsome real power in those legs.
Just keep on polishing those\nskills and sharpening your game.
Gah! This was just practice,\nbut they got us good.
You and me need to up our game, <avatar_name>.
I mean, Toho Academy plays to win!
Okay, we'll start the next\nround after a quick break!

Okay, we'll start the next round after a quick\nbreak!
Hey, Hyuga! Been awhile!
Misugi. I've been meaning to thank you.
That last showdown with you\nin the Tokyo regionals...
Until then, I didn't realize how soft I'd gotten.
Without that I woudn't have trained myself\nto be hard enough to challenge Nankatsu.
I'll pay you back this match.
That's as important to me\nas the fight with Nankatsu.
I'm going to be merciless...\nand set this field on fire!
Of course! That's all I want!
We were desperate back then.\nLeft a bad taste in my mouth.
Let's do it right this time.
I'm not the same person from before.
Same here! But we're still going to win!
I've studied your plays.\nI'd say we're in for a good game!
A game I'll win!
I'll study your moves, prodigy.
It'd be a heartbreaker if you did!
Is your heart really okay?
You think you're being funny?
Sorry, I didn't mean to snap. I just thought you\nmight be making a jab at me not being able\nto practice as much because of my illness.
I'd rather not be called that, okay?\nI've earned what I have through hard work.
That's a sharp tongue! Bring that same\nfire to the field and I'll forgive you!
Show me what you can do. I'm ready for it.
Throw everything at me that you got!
Thanks for caring. But you've\nplenty else to worry about right now.
The last thing I want on the field is compassion.
I couldn't beat you, Hyuga.
Last time you were angry and unfocused.\nBut this time I couldn't find an opening.
A passionate heart and a cool head...\nYou knew what you wanted and how to get it.
Hyuga, I can happily say this\nfrom the bottom of my heart.
You've conquered what was holding you back.
That... Thank you, Misugi.
You don't have to thank me.\nYou've worked hard and earned this.
By the way... How's your foot?
...
Of course you noticed it.
It's fine. A little pain isn't going to stop me.
Anyways, Misugi...\nI'll see you when we represent Japan.
Indeed! And keep pushing forward!
(Kojiro Hyuga...)
(Other rivals will appear in addition to Tsubasa.)
(I'll heal this body of mine\nand meet you again on the field!)
(<avatar_name>!\nI was truly surprised by your skill.)
(That match... It felt like fighting Tsubasa.\nI'm sad I lost, but it was a lotta fun!)
(I look forward to our rematch.\nThat will motivate me for the time being.)
(<avatar_name>, your technique\nand style remind me of Misaki.)
(If a player like him joins the national team,\nJapan will be a force to be reckoned with!)
All right! Let's split into\nteams for a practice match!
I got him!
Weak!
Uwaah!
(Man... My leg's getting worse every day.)
(But I can still...!)
(I have to lead Toho Academy next year.)
(For that, I need to get as strong as Hyuga.)
(I won't... I won't run away!)
Hyuga! I'm coming!
Takeshi... Bring it on!
Ung!
Hyuga!
Why did the captain drop like that\nfrom Takeshi's tackle? What's wrong...?!
Hyuga! It has to be...
Takeshi! Hyuga's ankle...!
Hey, <avatar_name>!
Hey, <avatar_name>!
Not another word!
Captain! Enough hiding!
What?!
Your ankle is injured.
What's that?!
Captain...
An injury...?!
How do you...?!
Did he tell...!
No, it wasn't <avatar_name>.\nHe didn't say anything.
I noticed when you took a Tiger Shot at practice.
I've seen a million of your kicks\nsince elementary school.
I could tell something was off.
I see...
Captain, please go to the hospital\nto have your foot examined.
Otherwise, we'd be too worried\nto focus on the game.
...
Hyuga.
I get it.
But whatever the doc says,\nI'm playing in the game.
Captain, how's your ankle?
I see. Understood.
I'll see you later.
How's the captain's foot?
It's swollen, but no breaks or sprains.
They want him for observation tonight,\nbut he'll be home tomorrow.
That's... good to hear.
But if he keeps practicing and playing,\nhe won't be able to heal.
The captain's isn't going to want to hear that...
The captain's not going to\nwant to talk about this at all.
He's been like that as long as I've known him.
Ever since elementary school, he's been unwilling\nto put any burden on others, as he sees it.
Hyuga has been a stand out striker since\nelementary school. And he's always pursued\nwinning like the Tiger he is.
That same drive kept him quiet about being hurt,\nand made him want to keep playing.
The captain has given everything for this team.
That's right. He's been up\nfront fighting the whole way.
Yeah, he's carried us a\nlong way in his drive to win.
Coach Kira and Coach Kitazume understood that.
Until you can sacrifice everything for the team,\nyou can't stand on the pitch as captain.
You also need to be able to inspire people to act.
Hyuga's done that and more.\nAnd more than proven himself as our captain.
I know I'm expected to lead the team next year,\nbut following in Hyuga's footsteps...
It's going to be hard... He's been so inspiring.
I think you got what it takes, Takeshi.\nBut Hyuga's presence will loom large.
Yeah, I can't imagine this team without Hyuga.
We can't beat Nankatsu like this!
Captain's carried the team too long!
<avatar_name>...
<avatar_name>...
It's just like <avatar_name> says.
Takeshi?
Hyuga is an amazing captain.\nOne of the best in Japan.
But we've been riding his coattails for far too\nlong. When did we stop fighting for ourselves?
I-I always looked for a\ngood opportunity to pass...
But I thought, even if it's a bit sloppy,\n"Hyuga will get it."
Me too. I always put my efforts into\nkeeping Hyuga from being marked closely.
I neglected defense so\nI could run up the field.
Same. And it got us in trouble over and over...
And that forced the captain back on defense...
We've been getting lazier and lazier with every\ngame, relying on the captain to bring it home.
It's not too late!
Let's be winners again!
Tak! Let's do it!
Alright! Just like the old days!
Totally! Give our captain a break!
We need to give his injury time to heal.
First, we review all our plays!
I don't want to hear anyone say they're tired!
That's right! Push yourselves!
Tak!
(I bet if I joined practice\nthey'd try to stop me.)
(But I won't be stopped...!)
Hey, Hyuga! Welcome back!
Y-Yes...
We've been waiting for ya, Captain!
We're done warming up! Let's get practicing!
Alright you...
(Figured I could take a break from practice.\nBut what is this...?)
Racja! Time for scrimmage!
Show some good defense!
Where's the captain? Everyone, defend!
Take this!
Uwaah!
Takeshi!
I'm coming!
Takeshi, get over there!
I got this covered!
Sorimachi!
Don't focus on Hyuga!
Takeshi!
Nice pass!
(If I do a fake here I can draw off the defense.)
(We got a path straight down the middle!)
Hyuga!
(There... I have a tiny window\nto get this shot in!)
The bigger they are...!
You did it, Hyuga!
Nice shot, Captain!
Oof... Thanks.
But enough about my shot!\nWhat the heck happened to you guys?
You ran an entirely different play than yesterday!
Actually, we talked about this.
We realized we've been relying\non you too much, Captain.
All our plays are sloppy. We've been counting\non you to pick up the slack, Captain.
So we decided together to change our game.
We have to take the pressure off you, Captain.\nEven if it's just a little!
You guys...
Hyuga, you gave everything\nyou had to make us winners!
It's only fair we do the same for you!
Takeshi...
...
Everyone, thank you.
The legs will run with Toho Academy to victory!
But! I'll need all of you, as well!\nFor Toho Academy!
Tak!
By the way, <avatar_name>,\nthat tackle was too hard...
You want to make the captain's leg worse?
I wanted to try my best!
I didn't want to lose!
Yeah... He'd appreciate that.
Good. Keep that spirit, <avatar_name>.
I'm glad you said what you said.\nI was about to flip out on you.
Come on! Let's get back to the scrimmage!
Tak!
We face each other again, Hyuga.
Matsuyama...
In the last Nationals, Furano\nhad their sights on Nankatsu.
As well as to take down you\nand Toho, and take the top spot.
It's not the same lineup,\nbut I am proud to challenge Toho again.
Matsuyama, you honor the\nNationals with your sportsmanship.
Just so you know, we don't plan to lose.
Matsuyama, we'll see you on the pitch.\nAnd we'll win!
We'll see about that!\nI've been training up north in the snow.
Hey first-year! I've been watching your matches.
You bring a lot to the field.\nBut soccer is a team sport.
And today we will be the victors!
Challenge accepted!
Soccer's a game of individual skill!
Wonder if you can handle the heat.
Heh... "Challenge Accepted"?\nDon't be so confident.
I like your brazen attitude!\nIt's gonna be a hot game today!
Although I disagree about soccer...
Individual skill has some value.
If you're looking for someone to test\nyourself on... Well, I'm right here!
And if you think I lack stamina from the heat\nbecause I was born in the frozen north, well...
Don't worry about that!
Our coach's wife created the\nspecial heat-busting brew of Hokkaido,\nmade with honey and milk.
And you'll see the guts of real men\nforged in the north. We never quit!
Today's heat is nothing compared\nto what we'll bring!
Matsuyama, we won again.
Heh... I think I liked you better like\nyou were in elementary school!
You were tougher today than in Nationals.\nYour increase in ability is obvious.
But it looks like we've managed to keep our edge.
Hyuga...
We're not there yet, but... Next time, we'll win!
Heh. We're looking forward to it.
(Hyuga says "we," but...)
(Toho Academy is Team Hyuga.)
(As Hyuga gets stronger,\nhe pulls the team along with him.)
(Toho Academy's last rival is Nankatsu...)
(No matter how good Tsubasa is,\nToho Academy has never been better...)
(You think I'm gonna let you\nkeep taking the ball?)
(I'm not losing that easily.\nI'll keep at it until I'm good enough.)
(We'll keep at it! And next time we'll win!)
(His ball-stealing and tenacity are hard to beat.)
(They'll face some tough times in the upcoming\nNationals, but it looks like this guy's ready.)
(As someone aiming to be All-Japan, I can't lose!)
The night before the last day\nof the Junior Hero League.
I'm too nervous to sleep...
I think I'll take a walk.
Huh?
<avatar_name>, can't sleep either, eh?
I'm too excited thinking about facing Tsubasa.\nHe's almost a myth these days as Nankatsu's ace.
I told you not to focus on Tsubasa, but...\nI can't take my own advice. He's my rival.
The instant Tsubasa graduates middle school,\nhe'll head to Brazil to pursue being a pro player.
If I miss tomorrow's game who knows when\nI will get the chance to face him again?
I'll give whatever I got to beat Tsubasa!
But beating Tsubasa is no longer my only dream.
It's defeating him alongside\nmy team that drives me.
That's what I really want.
<avatar_name>, why do you play soccer?
To win at Nationals with Toho Academy.
To be the best at my favorite sport.
To play for All-Japan.
Ah, of course. That's the reason you entered Toho.
I had a feeling... I can tell by\nthe way your push yourself at practice.
In other words, you're like me.
There's no worthier goal.
Playing soccer makes you\ncrave to play for your country.
Never forget that feeling, <avatar_name>.
Continue to believe. Hold onto your drive to win.\nThat will fuel your growth.
Captain! <avatar_name>!
What are you two doing at this hour?
You too, huh...?
I guess none of us could sleep?
Looks like it. Heh.
Well... As of tomorrow, it's all over...
Entering Toho Academy... Meeting the captain.
I could do without some of those tough\npractices, but when we win Nationals\ntomorrow, it'll all be worth it.
Playing in middle school has been great...\nBut I would like to beat Nankatsu once!
That's the rival we've been chasing\nsince the exhibition match.
Hyuga, there's no way we're losing tomorrow!
You guys...
We're goin' all the way!
Defeating Nankatsu will be the\nperfect finale for this team!
Tak!
Now... We better get some sleep.
Back to your rooms!
Okay, it's 2-v-2 time!
This time you're with Sorimachi, <avatar_name>.
Show me you can go up against\nTakeshi and Koike without me.
The rules are the same as last time:\nyou'll switch sides until someone scores.
Here we go!
Okay, wrap it up!
Not bad, you two!
Especially, <avatar_name>...\nYou pick up everything so fast.
Looks like Toho Academy's in\ngood hands for the next two years.
Not bad, you two!
And <avatar_name>! You'll have to keep the\nfighting spirit alive at Toho Academy\nSoccer Club for the next two years, too!
So you'd better practice even harder\nif you don't wanna fall behind Takeshi!
If you wish to bear the mantle of Toho's "play to\nwin" soccer, you have a great deal of work ahead\nof you, got it?
Okay, we'll start the next\nround after a quick break!
Okay, it's 2-v-2 time!

If you wish to bear the mantle of Toho's "play to\nwin" soccer, you have a great deal of work ahead\nof you, got it?
Okay, we'll start the next round after a quick\nbreak!
The day at last! What a beautiful summer sky!
The final match of the recently-established\nJunior Hero League soccer tournament.\nToho Academy vs. Nankatsu MS!
The teams won their brackets at the Junior\nNationals tournament. Now we bring\nthem together for a final showdown!
Nankatsu captain, Tsubasa Ozora, seems to\nhave recovered from his injuries at Nationals.
Today, Nankatsu face the prestigious Toho\nAcademy, which has been victorious in the middle\nschool, high school, and university soccer levels.
It's their best line-up yet,\nlead by their ace Kojiro Hyuga.
Toho has also bolstered their\nranks with promising first-years,\nwho have been driving their streak.
This will decide the ultimate, the best\nof the best, among the middle school teams!
Although this is an exhibition match,\neach is the champion of their league.\nThis is the de facto ultimate championship!
The match starts on the whistle!
Tsubasa! This is better than my birthday!
As I said at Nationals, I wanted to face the best.
I feel the same, Hyuga.
This is the real deal.\nThe last match of our middle school careers.
I'm so glad I can battle against you again, Hyuga!
Let's have a good game!
I'm bringing everything I got!
My team...
We're champions... And we will\nkick your butts. Count on it!
The winner of the Junior Hero League\nexhibition tournament is Toho Academy!
We... lost.
I can't believe it. We...
Toho Academy... Hyuga... We lost.
We won...
I beat Nankatsu... Beat Tsubasa!
We did it Captain!
We... we beat Nankatsu!
You beat Nakatsu... and Tsubasa Ozora!\nYou're the best striker in Japan!
The best striker in Japan...?
Totally, Captain!\nDon't you think so, <avatar_name>?
Yes! Our captain is the best!
In the world! In the universe!
He has my respect...
Right? Right? Without Captain Hyuga...
Come on now... Don't exaggerate.
It's enough to say that he is amazing!
Hey <avatar_name>, does that mean\nyou didn't respect him before?
Ha ha! I'm just kidding! I know what you mean!\nWe all feel the same.
Congratulations league champion, Captain Hyuga.
After winning three consecutive nationals,\nI figured I had no more rivals in Japan.\nI'd go to Brazil and turn pro...
That's what I thought.
...
I was mistaken.
Hyuga, you have always been my rival.\nEven before we were on such even footing.
And today, at the Nationals, you beat me.
I have my teammates to thank for this victory.
I didn't beat you, Tsubasa. This team did.
That's what was different this time.
I fought for the team to win... Not for myself.
It's so strange. I didn't realize\nhow important that was until now.
That's how we improve...\nBy moving beyond the limits of our past.
And still... I have a long ways to go.
Tsubasa...
Hyuga... It was a pleasure\nto face my rival at last.
Hey! That's my line!
Thanks to you, I improved.\nAnd I'll get stronger still.
Let's do this again, Tsubasa.
You bet! Only next time, I'll win!
Thanks to all teams who participated\nin this exhibition tournament!\nThe Junior Hero League is now over.
The MVP of the tournament is <avatar_name>!
He shot through this league like a comet!\nHe is truly the "Junior Hero!"
The MVP of the tournament is\nToho Academy's <avatar_name>!
Not only that, but he's the top scorer\nof the match. A double victory!
He shot through this league like a comet!\nHe is truly the "Junior Hero!"
The MVP of the tournament is\nKojiro Hyuga, Toho team captain!
At Nationals, he only played in the final match,\nbut for this tournament he led his team\nto victory in every game!
And the top scorer is Toho Academy <avatar_name>!
He even pushed out ace striker\nCaptain Hyuga from the same team!
A magnificent achievement!
The MVP of the tournament is\nKojiro Hyuga, Toho team captain!
At Nationals, he only played in the final match,\nbut for this tournament he led his team\nto victory in every game!
We would like to recognize twenty-one\nincredible players from the Junior Hero League!
From Toho Academy, Hyuga! Wakashimazu!\nSorimachi! Sawada!
And last but not least, <avatar_name>!
These twenty-one players will travel to\nthe United States to represent Japan\nin international competition.
Watch out! This new generation of players\nwill show the world what Japan can do!
Well, we finally beat Nankatsu.
Might be an exhibition, but man, it feels good.
Of course, I was happy to be co-champions\nat Nationals, but this is even better.
Takeshi, you'll be leading the team next.
Yeah. I know.
Have you seen the captains of the other teams?\nTsubasa? Matsuyama? Misugi? The rest?
Their personalities and play styles are\ndifferent, but they share something in common...
In both playing and attitude,\nthey all lift up their teams.
...
I'm not saying imitate them, but learn\nfrom them to find your own strengths.
That's my plan.
Then everything'll be fine.
If you know that much, you'll be okay.
We'll be counting on you\nfor next year's Nationals!
All the way!
Hello, everyone. It's been a while!
Oh! Coach Kitazume!
I'm not your coach anymore.
Did you come see the game?
Of course. It was a sight to behold.
Thank you so much.
I've watched every match of yours\nsince the Nationals. But I was still impressed.
I thought you were an immature team,\nbut one with great potential.
Huh?
Especially, <avatar_name>.
I've always regretted not helping realize\nyour full potential. But at least I got to see\nyou find it yourself.
That's not quite right.
Hmm?
The captain's right!
The only reason we made it this far...
Was because we had you to mentor us!
I appreciate that...
You were all amazing students.
What are your plans now?
I'll have something to do with soccer, of course.
I'll find some middle school or high school in\nneed of a soccer coach. Then raise those kids to\ncompete at Nationals.
I can't wait to meet Toho Academy on the field!
Tak! I can't wait!
That's what I was hoping to hear.
Keep practicing until then!\nI want to find you ready!
Yes, sir!
You can do it, Takeshi!
Have confidence in yourself!
Got it!
<avatar_name> I'm glad I was right about you.
Hold onto that drive for victory, and help\nTakeshi take Toho Academy to another victory.
You got it! Toho Academy soccer\nnever backs down from a fight!
That's the spirit!
I'll do the best I can!
We'll do it together!
<avatar_name>, I'm with you.
Let's take it to the next Nationals together.
Cheers for All-Japan player Captain Hyuga!
And for Wakashimazu, Sorimachi, and Takeshi!
And <avatar_name>, of course! Hip hip, hooray!
Thanks everyone!
I knew this would happen.
Is this a dream?
When you joined you never even imagined\nyou'd play for the Japanese national team, I bet.
Oh sure.
You knew you'd go from nothing to\nrepresenting Japan in one season?
Have a little modesty!
Maybe... when you wake up you'll\nstill be a second-stringer?
I'm kidding! You're here\nbecause you have what it takes!
Wow, five reps from our team...
Of course, the majority are from Nankatsu.
It should be the opposite. We won...
Don't worry, everyone!
Huh?
We're bringing the heat for you guys too!
Racja! We're all on that team!
We all fight together!
And we're counting on your support!

Befriend the ball!
The ball's my friend!
Soccer is life!
The ball is an old friend.
Just like back home!
This isn't some kids' street game!
They broke through...
I'll definitely hold onto this 1 point!
Two isn't enough! Mark with three!
I'll score this point even if it kills me.
We can settle this on the field!
They took two points. On ME.
Dang, these guys don't know when to quit.
Can't let my focus slip for even a second.
Alright! Birdcage time!
I've mastered the offside trap!
Not like this...
Just try and stop my dribble.
To think it would turn out like this...
Soccer is about 11 players, not 1!
It's not over until the whistle blows!
A long shot can't beat me!
I won't let a single shot through!
I'll steal a goal from you!
The tackle is just the start!
I'll score from outside the penalty box.
We won the match!
Even if it takes all I got, you won't score a single point!
We won't really be the champions unless we win here!
Soccer is the best, isn't it?
If we can make one shot in one minute, we win.
This is real soccer!
I'm going for fifty points in this match.
Hit me with your best shot!
The strongest don't always win in soccer.
Whoever wins is the strongest!
Martial arts work well in soccer.
I'm all about whatever it takes to win.
Take out your anger on the ball.
Why did you rush in alone?
I can't keep my promise to you.
What?
What?!
Wh-What?!
No way...
*smile*
Yeah, boy!
Take this!
Wahoo!
Ha!
Hoo!
Hoo hoo!
Keep the hustle!
Burnt!
Hoo boy!
Takin' out tough guys is my hobby.
Hey fellas!
This Razor Shot's got an extra blade!
Fire!
Tiger!
It's the Karate Keeper!
That's why you're the Godlike Goalkeeper of Legend!
Looks like this is it for me.
Wh-What incredible play!
The goalie can't get it!
I made it!
My legs are done in!
Please... Get us that one point.
I stopped it, guys.
Not taking that invitation.
What a miracle!
We can at least shine like silver!
My Golden Right Hand still has strength!
We just have to try harder!

You guys are number one.

July
We've got clear summer skies here in Shizuoka,\nas the regional soccer tournament\nis finally getting underway!
Now which of these schools will win the honor of\nrepresenting us at this year's Nationals?
It should be no surprise that the favorites to\nwin are last year's winners, Nankatsu MS!
In fact, Nankatsu MS has yet to taste defeat,\nsince their captain, Tsubasa Ozora, enrolled!
Not only that, the team already made history when\nthey won at Nationals both last year and\nthe year before!
Now, let's begin the opening ceremony!
Presenting the championship banner!
Captain Tsubasa Ozora of last year's\nwinning team, Nankatsu MS, will now return the\nchampionship banner.
Ishizaki.\nThis year, we're taking that banner home.
What're you babblin' on about?\nSave it for if ya make the finals.
You sure talk big. Fine.\nWe'll make the finals. And we're going to do it\nwith more goals and giving up fewer points.
Come on now. You think we'd lose to you?
Put up or shut up! Let's make a little bet.\nThe loser has to do whatever the winner says.
Great! I'm in!
(Gotta fight to the finals.\nWe're showing you your first loss,\nno question.)
...
The nerve of this guy...
(Oh, I see.\nStill wearing that confident smile.)
(But just you wait! Because when it's\nfinals time, I'm going to wipe that smirk\nclean off your face, and teach you defeat!)
And thus began the\nShizuoka Regional Tournament.
Nankatsu MS were the favorites to win, and with\nTsubasa as their core, they steadily advanced\nthrough the tournament.
At the same time, Otomo MS hardened their\ndefenses with Urabe, Nakayama, Kishida, and\nNishio, known as the "Otomo Quartet."
This gave their forward, Nitta, the chance to score\ngoal after goal, carrying them through the\ntournament like clockwork.
And then came the finals.
The fated day for the two titans to clash\nfinally arrived.
Listen up, everyone!
Up to now, our opponents in this\ntourney have been nothing special,\nbut Otomo is a different story!
They haven't given up a single point this whole\ntournament. Their strategy prioritizes\ndefense.
The Otomo Quartet and their tall keeper\ntogether form an iron wall\nthat stops any offense dead in its tracks.
That's when their fleet-footed forward, Nitta,\nstarts pounding in the powerful shots.\nThe kid can run 100 meters in 11 seconds.
It's a simple strategy, but an effective one.\nThe strength of their defense and the speed of\ntheir offense are without a doubt Nationals-level.
So you need to stay focused out there!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Coach, can I get in at defensive midfield?\nLet me mark Nitta.
You want to mark Nitta, Tsubasa?
If I stick to attacking, Nitta will be Otomo's\nonly offensive player, and he'll be unchallenged.
Plus, if you had seen the look in his eyes...\nHe's calling me out.
And, well, I'd like to take him up on that.
Got it. Then let's go with your plan.
Everyone else alright with that?
Y-Yes!
Y-Yes!
Y-Yes!
Y-Yes!
Y-Yes!
Y-Yes!
Guys, we're bringing home our third\nchampionship. Today, we win.
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
We've worked so hard this past year, and all to\ntake down Nankatsu.
And today is the day we make it happen!
After all our training,\nNankatsu won't know what hit 'em.
This year, we're stepping right over them\nand heading to Nationals!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
(Just you watch, Tsubasa Ozora. This is our time.)
It's finally here, folks! The final match of the\nShizuoka Regionals, and the qualifier for the\nNational MS Soccer Tournament!
The starting lineups for both teams are made up\nof some of the best players we've seen\nas far back as anyone can remember!
Each of their aces, Nankatsu's Tsubasa\nand Otomo's Nitta, even used to play at\nthe same youth soccer club, Nankatsu SC!
And while Tsubasa led the club to the\nchampionship as captain three years ago,
Nitta managed the same\nimpressive feat two years ago!
What's more, almost all the players Tsubasa\nplayed with back then are now here as third\nyears at either Nankatsu or Otomo MS!
This is truly a showdown for the ages, folks!
Now, who will be crowned king of Shizuoka soccer?\nThe invincible Nankatsu or the rising stars\nat Otomo!
The crowd is watching closely as the\nShizuoka Regional finals are getting underway.\nAnd there's the kickoff!
(Kisugi... Taki... Izawa... Takasugi...)
(You can blame yourselves for us wanting to\ntake down Nankatsu.)
(Back at the National Youth Soccer Tournament,\nyou were the ones chosen as the MVPs.)
(But us? We were like shadows.\nWe were nothing.)
(That's right. It was the need to mean something\nthat got us this far.)
(And as for you, Tsubasa...)
(This past year was about training for one thing.\nTaking down Nankatsu. Defeating you.)
(We worked hard every day,\nso you could never outpace us.)
(So we could react to your fakes.)
(We trained so hard for the entire year.)
(We may not have your talent,\nbut no one trains harder than we do!)
Today, we're going home winners!\nLet's do it!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Finally, our chance to play Tsubasa Ozora.
That's right. Finally.
I've waited for this!
Bring it on, Nitta!
Okay, Tsubasa! Just try and get past us!
I don't care if there are four of you.\nNothing's stopping me!
Ugh!
(Amazing... Not a single\nopening!)
(Well played, Tsubasa!\nHe's finally done it.)
(C'mon, Tsubasa! I'll show you how good I am!)
Eat thiiis!
What!
But...!
No way!
No way!
(Hmph. Not bad, Tsubasa.)
(I even aimed for your face,\nso we'd score if you dodged.)
(But you managed to just nudge it.\nYou wouldn't give up the point.)
(Thank you, Nitta.)
(What?)
(What a great feeling. It's been so long since\nsomeone's fired me up like this.)
(This Otomo Quartet has a bit\nof style.)
(My only hope is to go for a\nno-trap shot!)
And that's the first half!
The previous year's champions Nankatsu are\nentering halftime with a lead over Otomo MS!
And that's the first half!
Both teams are neck to neck in the Regional\nfinals!
And that's the first half!
Shockingly, last year's champs, Nankatsu,\nhave let Otomo take an early lead in the\nRegional finals!
Alright,\ngood work out there.
Look, Nakazawa made lemon slices\nwith honey and sugar for you all.
Eat up, everyone.
Yes, Coach.
Sweet, thanks.
Okay, now keep it up for the second half!
Dangit!\nI hoped we'd crush 'em in the opening half!
Chill out, Nitta.
We play defensive.\nBeing tied just means they're right where we want\nthem.
We stick to the plan. We keep up the defense\nuntil you find your opening to score in the\nsecond half. We're counting on you.
Right...
This is bad! We let them take the lead!
This is all my fault! If only I'd--
Nitta! Calm down.
We defend and you score. That's our strategy.\nAll we have to do now is make it work.
Right...
(Whether we win or not...\nIt all comes down to me.)
(But I can't get around Tsubasa...\nNot by myself, anyway.)
(So what am I gonna do?)
(With my speed, I should be able\nto shake him off for at least a moment.)
(So if I take a pass at the right moment...)
(Naw, I'd need more time.)
(My only choice is to go for a no-trap shot.)
(But can I really pull that technique off?)
Hey, Nitta! It's time! Idziemy!
R-Right.
(I just gotta go for it.\nJust... go for it.)
No! But we haven't lost yet!
Now the match really begins!\nIt's not over yet, Otomo!
We're going for victory number three at\nNationals! You think we'd lose to you here?
If it gets taken, take it back.\nThat's the first rule of soccer.
Let's do this, guys!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Alright! We're in total control!
As long as we can keep Tsubasa marked in the\nsecond half too, this is in the bag.
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
...
What's wrong, Nitta?
No, it's nothing...
(Nankatsu are the national champions\ntwo years running.)
(Beating them here and becoming the champs...\nThat's more than a dream.\nThat can be real.)
(It's time to push my Falcon Shot to the next\nlevel! For the championship!)
Alright folks, the second half of the match\nbetween Nankatsu and Otomo is\nfinally ready to begin!
Can Nankatsu clear their first obstacle on the\npath to their third Nationals victory?!
Alright folks, the second half of the match\nbetween Nankatsu and Otomo is\nfinally ready to begin!
Which of their aces, Tsubasa or Nitta,\ncan break this deadlock?!
Alright folks, the second half of the match\nbetween Nankatsu and Otomo is\nfinally ready to begin!
If Nankatsu wants a third Nationals victory, they\nneed to turn this around! Can they show us the\nstrength that made them champions twice already?
Time to fly!
Hey! You're no Tsubasa, ya know!
You'll never have the skill\nto pull off something like that!
(You think I don't know?\nI know that better than anyone.)
(But to beat Nankatsu...\nAnd Tsubasa... I have to do this.)
Hey, Urabe, what the heck's Nitta up to?\nWe didn't practice that. That's way too advanced.
Couldn't tell you.
But we're gonna pass it to him.\nHe's our best shot!
Urabe...
So that's the timing!
(That shot from Nitta...\nHis timing is getting better.)
(If this keeps up, we're in trouble.)
How about this!
What a shot! Looks like Nitta's gotten\nthat timing nearly 80% figured out!
Oh, a near miss!\nNankatsu gets a goal kick!
I got it this time. Here it goes!
It's now or never!
Go!
And there it is folks! Goalkeeper Morisaki and\nthe Nankatsu defense were frozen in place!
And there it is folks! Goalkeeper Morisaki\nand the Nankatsu defense were frozen in place!
I-I did it!
I finally pulled it off!\nThe no-trap running volley Falcon Shot!
That crazy...
That nut really pulled it off!
(Nitta, someone like you is just...)
You did it, Nitta!
(Keep passing to Nitta, right\nto the very end!)
And that's the game!
The winner of the Shizuoka Regionals is\nNankatsu MS for three years running!\nThey're headed to Nationals!
This game could've gone either way, folks,\nbut Otomo MS just ran out of steam!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
Woohoo! Next up, Nationals!
Sorry, Nitta.\nWe let you down.
No, you didn't.
When it comes down to it,\nI lost this game to Tsubasa Ozora.
(But after this match, I've made up my mind!)
(From now on, my goal is to face Tsubasa again!\nAnd next time, I'm coming out on top.)
Nankatsu's good. It was worth comin' all the way\nout here jus' ta see 'em.
Yes.
But s'gonna be us that beat 'em!
Racja!
Exactly. What Tsubasa needs most right now\nis someone like you.
Wh-Who're you?
I represent the Japan Soccer Association.
And you two are Hiroshi Jito and Mitsuru Sano,\nfrom Hirado Middle School. I also know you were\nat last year's Nagasaki Regionals.
...!
I get it. You're sizin' us up, too.
Tsubasa had competition in elementary school.\nBut in these past two years,\nhis talent has dwarfed theirs considerably.
But today,\nthe unpolished Tsubasa encountered Nitta,\na foe with a strength he'd never seen before.
I'm sure the one most pleased by this turn of\nevents was Tsubasa himself.
In order for Tsubasa to improve even more,\nhe needs more rivals like Nitta.
In that regard, I have very high\nexpectations for you, Jito.
Hah!\nWell, I'd hate to letcha down. We'll be bringin'\nNankatsu's triple victory journey to a close.
Ishizaki!
Urabe...
We lost.\nNankatsu was just too strong after all.
As promised, the loser has to do whatever the\nwinner says. Name your price.
Okay then, Urabe.\nForget about it. S'not important.
I-I can't do that!\nThat was a wager between men!
Fine.\nThen, you hafta cheer for us at Nationals.
Huh?
Really? That's it?
Yup!
Alright, then we'll cheer our lungs out!
But in exchange, don't you dare lose on us!\nDon't forget you're representing\nall of Shizuoka out there!
Y-Yeah!
Tsubasa.\nWe did what we could, but...
Turns out we weren't a match for you.
Win at Nationals for us, Tsubasa.
I'll never forgive you if you lose, Tsubasa.
You guys...
Don't you worry! We're going all the way!
And now, let's hear from Tsubasa Ozora,\ncaptain of the winning team!
First of all, congratulations, Tsubasa.
Thank you very much.
Next up for you is Nationals,
but right now, which player would\nyou most like to play against?
Who do I want to take on?
For now, that'd have to be...
Taro Misaki.
Taro Misaki?!
As in, Misaki who you played side-by-side with in\nelementary school? Your old partner? That Misaki?
The one and only.
But he completely disappeared from the world of\nsoccer after the National Youth Soccer Tournament.
Rumor has it he suffered an injury to his\nleg during the finals,\nand that he's never recovered.
No, that can't be.\nThat would never happen to the Misaki I know.
I'm sure he's out there somewhere,\nstill playing the beautiful game.\nI know he must be.
Tsubasa Ozora.\nHe's grown quite a bit since I last saw him.
Tatsuo Mikami\nJapan MS All-Star Team: Coach
Mikami, I've heard good things about\nyour training in Germany. Well done.
Thanks, Katagiri.\nIt's been a while.
How's Wakabayashi been faring\non his study abroad in Germany?
Same as always. Working hard.
Rubbing shoulders with some pros,\nand learning at a remarkable rate.
I doubt he even needs my coaching anymore.
Is that so?
(Meaning the only one unaccounted for\nis Tsubasa's eternal partner, Taro Misaki.)
(But it's almost as if he dropped off the face of\nthe Earth after elementary school.)
(I had heard that Misaki frequently changed\nschools due to his father being an artist.)
(There's no way he would have quit soccer.\nBut it seems equally unlikely I wouldn't\nhave heard about a player of his level.)
(Meaning he must have...)
Yes? Hello?
Wh-What did you say?!
And there's the whistle! That's the game, folks!
After sixty minutes and two halves of fierce\ncompetition, neither team has given an inch!
The Shizuoka Regional finals will\nbe decided by penalty shootout!
Darn it!\nI wanted to win fair and square.\nNot like... this!
It's a bit late for that now.
First, we're going to win this shootout,\nand then we're headed to Nationals!
I'm not letting our dream\ndie here!
We just couldn't make it happen!
It's fine, Nitta. It was your\nskills that brought us even this far.
Listen up, guys!\nWe're winning this shootout.
And then Otomo MS is going to Nationals!
After a heated final match, it's finally over!
The winner of the Shizuoka Regionals is\nNankatsu MS for three years running!\nThey're headed to Nationals!
Otomo MS may have cornered the reigning\nchampions, but they were never able to make\nthat final push!
After a heated final match, it's finally over!
Otomo MS dominated the shootout and\nwon themselves a ticket to Nationals!
Nankatsu's dreams of a third victory at Nationals\nwere ended before the main event!
And that's game!\nNankatsu loses!
The winners of the Shizuoka Regionals are\nOtomo MS, led by Urabe!
Nankatsu's dreams of a third victory at Nationals\nwere ended by a disappointing defeat at Regionals!
A day later, Nankatsu made the Nationals.
Teams winning regional tournaments throughout\nthe country would soon be representing their homes\non the national stage.
As teams whose players have mostly struggled\nas one since elementary school, they are\ndistinguished by their outstanding teamwork.
Led by team captain Matsuyama, this team\ndeveloped a swift offense and sticky defense.\nReal teamwork. Representing Hokkaido: Furano MS.
Specializing in high-flying acrobatic soccer\nusing even the goal posts, this team has a\nunique combo play that can't be imitated.
Their greatest asset is the Tachibana twins, who\nscore 90% of their goals.\nRepresenting Akita: Hanawa MS.
Despite their Nationals-level keeper Nakanishi,\nNaniwa MS had their 3-year streak of representing\nOsaka broken by the up and coming: Azumaichi MS.
And in Tokyo...
We're finally entering the endgame of the Tokyo\nRegional finals!
In the first half we saw a hat trick from Toho\nAcademy's Hyuga, the national record holder for\nmost goals two years running!
But their opponent is Musashi MS!
Kept off the field for the two years after\nelementary school while recovering from his heart\ndisease, the prodigy himself...
Jun Misugi is making his comeback!
Although limited to only thirty minutes of play\nper match, he's kept his skills so sharp you'd\nnever know he ever took time off!
He's even personally taken two points from\nWakashimazu, the number one keeper who hadn't\nconceded a single goal this whole tournament!
And now, at long last, the two aces clash!
This win is mine!
(I'm not losing to Tsubasa!)
You think I'd lose now!
(I've endured two years of rehabilitation,\nbetting it all on this last year.)
(Losing would mean not going to Nationals,\nand I wouldn't be able to face Tsubasa again.\nI'm not through yet!)
Get it!
Gotta stop--
Ugh...!
Seriously?!
Ah! What happened to Misugi?!\nHe's collapsed on the field!
And Hyuga loses control of the ball!
!
Such tenacity! Even as he's collapsing,\nMisugi manages to pass the loose ball!
Let's do it, guys!
(Misugi gave us this chance.)
(He risked his life for this.)
(We have to get a goal!\nWe just have to!)
As if fired up by Misugi's sacrifice, Musashi's\nforwards are making a quick chain of passes!\nThey're making a mockery of Toho's defense!
This is it! It's all up to you, Honma!
One last pass from Ichinose!
This is it, folks!\nHonma versus Wakashimazu! Mano a mano!
Wakashimazu dives for it with everything he's got!
Got it!
There'll be no third point for you!
The nerve of this guy...
Gah!
What are they...?
H-He stopped it! Wakashimazu stopped it!
Musashi's unstoppable force was stopped by\nthe immovable object that is Wakashimazu!
...
No way!
Misugi...
*pant* *pant*\nI'm okay.
Did we... score?
I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah...
And Misugi is finally subbed out!
And that means...
My oh my!\nAnd that's the end of the match!
In the end, even with Misugi literally\nputting his life on the line, Musashi\ncouldn't take down Toho!
Toho is going to Nationals\nfor the third year in a row!
Will they finally pay back Nankatsu MS for those\nlast two defeats at finals?
Well, haven't you become warm and fuzzy, Kojiro?
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Excuse me, who might you be?\nThis area is for players and associates on--
Coach Kira!
Huh?
He was my and Takeshi and the Captain's\ncoach back in elementary school.
You took it easy on Misugi\nwhen you saw him going down,\ndidn't you, Kojiro?
I-I...
That's not the boy I knew.\nThe man you were becoming...
Once you stepped on the pitch, the need to win\nreplaced kindness. Only ferocity served\nany purpose. Y'know, back then.
There was a time you would've gone for the goal\neven if Misugi's heart had burst from his chest\nright there!
B-But--!
You kept your family afloat when your\nfather died. And even then, you still\npracticed harder than anyone.
Everyone on the team looked up to you\nfor your dedication to soccer,\nand knowing what you were going through.
But it looks like something other than soccer's\nbeen in your thoughts since going to Toho Academy.
What happened to your hunger?! That spirit\nyou had as a kid?! I don't see the fire anymore.
You've lost your claws! You're nothing but a\npaper tiger.
At this rate, Takeshi and Wakashimazu and your\nother teammates will lose faith in you.
And in the end, you'll never be as good as\nTsubasa Ozora. And he just keeps getting better.
Wha--?
I've opened up a soccer school in Okinawa.
Feel free to drop by sometime. If you don't\nwant to lose to Tsubasa Ozora, that is.
(Am I really a tiger that's lost its claws?\nHas my spirit grown so weak?)
Captain...
Hyuga...
Hyah!
(Darn it!\nThe ball keeps drifting off course.)
(Tsubasa.\nPut some drive behind your long shot!)
(If you can pull off this shot,\nyou're going straight to the top!)
(This new long shot...\nthe Drive Shot.)
(This is really tough, Roberto.)
(I just don't get how I'm supposed to\ntransfer the drive spin into the ball.)
(If only I had more than just these\nnotes Roberto left me.)
(If only he were here to show me.)
(I guess all I can do on my own\nis keep practicing.)
(Roberto, next year I'm going to Brazil.)
(Once I get my third victory at Japanese\nNationals, then I'm taking on Brazil!)
One more time!
Coach, the Captain's--
We can't find Hyuga! He's not in the dorm!
You can't find him?! What could he\nbe up to right before the tournament?
He probably went to see Coach Kira in Okinawa.
Okinawa?
Kozo Kira's Okinawa Youth Soccer School
What's wrong, boys?\nIf you're gonna whine about a little training,\nyou'll never amount to much.
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
I'm here, Coach Kira.
So you've come, Kojiro.
Yeah.
I've waited for this!
Bring it on, Nitta!
Okay, Tsubasa! Just try and get past us!
I don't care if there are four of you.\nNothing's stopping me!
Ugh!
(Amazing... Not a single\nopening!)
(Well played, Tsubasa!\nHe's finally done it.)
(C'mon, Tsubasa! I'll show you how good I am!)
Get a mouthful of this!
(This Otomo Quartet has a bit\nof style.)
(My only hope is to go for a\nno-trap shot!)
Time to fly!
So that's the timing!
How about this!
Play in the 1st JYWC Tournament
Chłopiec wychowywał się z piłką nożną\nzawsze blisko jego stóp.
W wieku jedenastu lat jego przeprowadzka do miasta Nankatsu\nstała się katalizatorem\ndwóch pamiętnych spotkań.
Jedno z gwiazdą brazylijskiej piłki nożnej,\nRoberto Hongo...
a drugie z cudownym bramkarzem,\nGenzo Wakabayashim.
Spotkanie tej dwójki,\nstało się solidnymi korzeniami jego pasji do piłki nożnej.
Walka z kolegami z drużyny i rywalami,\ntworzenie więzi i zrywanie innych...\nKażde doświadczenie stało się jego siłą.
Od tych dwóch owocnych spotkań minęły cztery\nlata. Stawił czoła niezliczonym próbom.\nA teraz...
jest gotowy, by rozwinąć skrzydła\ni powitać szeroki świat.
Jego imię to Tsubasa Ozora.
Kapitan Tsubasa
Zaraz zacznie się mecz. Jesteś gotowy?
Tak! Zróbmy to!
Nie mam pojęcia...
Podoba mi się to spojrzenie! Dobra, idziemy!
Ha! Nerwy biorą górę?\nWszystko będzie dobrze. Po prostu dobrze się baw! Idziemy!
Nareszcie!\nMecz, na którą wszyscy czekali!
Finał pierwszego "Junior Youth World\nChallenge," odbywa się w Ameryce, Japonia kontra Niemcy!
Która z tych dwóch drużyn zdobędzie prawo\ndo nazywania się mistrzami świata?
Zawodnicy obu drużyn wychodzą na boisko!
Duma Japonii i as wśród napastników\nKojiro Hyugaaa!
SWB (Super Wspaniały Bramkarz),\nGenzo Wakabayashi!
Rywalizują ze sobą od dzieciństwa. A teraz wychodzą na boisko\ngrając w jednej drużynie, reprezentując całą Japonię!
I wreszcie, zawodnik wybrany przez\nProgram Rozwoju Zawodników,\nprzygotowany specjalnie na ten turniej!
Nowy rodzaj mistrza!
Ich przywódca!\nNasz kapitan!
Tsubasa Ozora!
(Po odwołaniu Międzynarodowego Turnieju Młodzieży Juniorów\nwe Francji, rozpoczęto prace\nnad nowym turniejem).
(Jest to nieco nieoczekiwane, ale przez ten\nniefortunny obrót wydarzeń, ci chłopcy będą\nteraz błyszczeć na jeszcze większej scenie).
(W końcu nadszedł ten czas).
(Tsubasa...)
A po drugiej stronie pola, prowadzony przez młodego cesarza\nKarla Heinza Schneidera,\n niemiecki Jr.! Youth Corps!
(Teraz leć, Tsubasa).
(Niech nasze sny będą wiatrem pod twoimi skrzydłami,\n gdy wzbijesz się w powietrze, by podbić świat,\nTsubasa)!
Dalej, zróbmy to!
Wooo!
Wooo!
Wooo!
Wooo!
Wooo!
Wooo!
Ludzie, dziś na boisku jest samo południe!
Zrobili to! The All-Japan Junior Youth Team really did it!\nThey've taken a point from the Germans!
Alright!\nLet's keep it up!
On it!
Got it!
On it!
Alright!
(It's just one goal,\nbut the significance cannot be overstated.)
(This is the birth of a new legend\nfor these kids--no, for all of Japanese\nsoccer. The future has arrived!)
(Tsubasa... Hyuga... Matsuyama... Soda... Jito...\nthe Tachibana brothers... Misugi...)
(It's been only a few months, but it feels so\nlong ago. Then again, it could've been\nyesterday. Who could forget that heated battle?)
(The Middle School Nationals...\nThe tournament where these boys\nmatured into the amazing players they are today.)
Okay!\nThat was fifteen 50-meter dashes!
Nankatsu Middle School Soccer Club\nMidfielder\nCaptain Tsubasa Ozora
Catch your breath, and get ready to\nsplit up into practice teams!
Nankatsu Middle School Soccer Club\nMidfielder\nMamoru Izawa
Right.
Yes, Coach.
I see.
Yes, Coach?
I'll do my best, Coach.
Okay.
I can’t hear yooou!\nGive me some energy!
Nankatsu Middle School Soccer Club\nDefender\nRyo Ishizaki
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Can't believe it's almost time\nfor Summer Nationals.
Nankatsu Middle School Soccer Club\nForward\nHajime Taki
If we win again this year, we'll be remembered\nas the first three-time national champs.
Nankatsu Middle School Soccer Club\nForward\nTeppei Kisugi
It would be pretty cool to graduate\nwithout a single loss.
Nankatsu Middle School Soccer Club\nGoal Keeper\nYuzo Morisaki
Tak! So no slacking off!
Nankatsu Middle School Soccer Club\nDefender\nShingo Takasugi
Good work out there, everyone.
Nankatsu Middle School Soccer Club\nManager\nSanaé Nakazawa
I'm sure you built up a good sweat,\nso I brought some towels.
Thanks!
Nakazawa you seem different.
Right? You used to lead the\ncheer squad in elementary school.\nWhere'd all that energy go?
Well, now she's "proper" and "ladylike."
Here's your towel, Tsubasa.
Thanks.
Hey!\nHow come Tsubasa gets the one new towel?
Wh-What?
C'mon!\nWhere's my new towel?
Geez! Chill out!
Ow!
Hey! Tsubasa!
Nankatsu Middle School Soccer Club\nCoach\nTakeshi Furuoya
Tsubasa! Katagiri's here.
Wha-- Mr. Katagiri?!
He's waiting for you over there.\nGo and say hello.
Okay!
Hey, who's this Katagiri guy?
He's from the Japan Soccer Association.\nHe's had an interest in Tsubasa’s skills since\nthe early days. Tsubasa owes him a lot.
You know how Tsubasa went to that special high\nschool draft training camp this spring?\nKatagiri made that happen.
Whoa.
Hello, Mr. Katagiri.
Looks like you're doing well, Tsubasa.
Thank you!
I came to talk to you about a video\nof your play I sent to some pro teams in Brazil.
You did?!\nWh-What did they say?
I heard back from a lot of teams.\nYou've really caught their attention.\nSome couldn't believe you're really fourteen.
Then I can head to Brazil as soon as I\nfinish middle school?
Yes...
But these are the pros.\nThey're not going to sign you right away.
Some people aren't going to be happy\nwith you moving there.\nBe ready for that.
Thank you.
(Tsubasa's soccer mentor is Roberto Hongo,\ncenter forward for the Brazilian National team.)
(Roberto returned to Brazil when\nTsubasa graduated elementary school.)
(But due to circumstances,\nhe couldn't take Tsubasa with him.)
(Yet, Tsubasa used this emotional blow as a\nspringboard to new heights. Today, he's\na two-time national middle school champion.)
(His skills already dwarf those of most\nhigh school players.)
Uh... Mr. Katagiri?
Huh? Oh, sorry. I got lost\nin my thoughts for a second there.
Well, that's all I had for today.\nI'll be seeing you.
What? But you just got here.
I'm a busy man, you know.\nI'm touring the country after this.\nPlaces to go. People to see.
Anyway, for now I want you focusing on the Middle\nSchool Nationals. We can talk Brazil after.
Roger!
Win, Tsubasa.
Of course!
There's no other way I can become\na three-time national champion.
(That's the way, Tsubasa. Prove your dominance\nwith a third championship win.\nTechnically, four if we count elementary school.)
(And then, we get you to Brazil,\nwhere you'll undoubtedly rise to the top.)
(That's how we will revolutionize Japanese\nsoccer. You will need to take the reins,\nTsubasa, and then we can change Japan!)
And then our dream can finally come true...
Winning the World Cup!
Winning the World Cup!
Winning the World Cup!
Well... See you around.
Done talking already?
Uh huh...
Alright! Time for a scrimmage!
Woohoo!
Phew! That's halftime! Halftime, guys!
What've you been doing since last year?\nYou guys haven't gotten any better.
Huh?!
Why you...!
Hyuga!
Toho Middle School Soccer Club\nCenter Forward\nKojiro Hyuga
What do you think you're doing here?
Oh ya know, I was just in the area,\nso I dropped by.\nI'm here to issue a challenge, dummy.
A challenge?
When Nankatsu beat Toho at the Middle School\nNationals, it was the second year in a row\nyou stole first from us. It sucked.
But not this year!
Not only do we have Wakashimazu, the number one\nkeeper anywhere! But the rest of us are on a whole\ndifferent level now, too!
My elementary school teammate,\nTakeshi Sawada, is gonna be there, too. To really\nseal the deal, and put Toho over the top!
But 'course soccer ain't even really about\nhaving the best players.\nIt's about having the best teamwork!
This year, Nankatsu's going down.\nThis championship is gonna be ours!
We'll never lose to you, Hyuga!\nNankatsu's taking its third championship without a\ndoubt!
Yeah, you heard him!\nYou should be used to settling for second best\nby now, anyway.
I can't even believe you guys.\nJust knowing you'll be at the tournament\nputs a bad taste in my mouth.
Honestly, I can't believe\nI played with you guys on the\nNankatsu Soccer Club back in elementary school.
Wh-Who's that?!
Otomo Middle School Soccer Club\nMidfielder\nCaptain Hanji Urabe
Oh, it's just Urabe and Kishida.\nHaven't seen you two since elementary school.\nHow've you been, pals?
We're not your pals, friend!\nWe may have been on the same team once, but we're\ngoing to take you out!
What did you say?
Toho won't be the ones ending your streak,\nNankatsu! Otomo will see to it ourselves!
What the--
Are you joking? I remember how you guys\nused to play. You beating Nankatsu is crazy talk.
Alright, then.\nPerhaps, a little demo is in order.
Nitta!
Let's do this, Tsubasa Ozora!
!
(Wh-Why am I so nervous?)
Tsubasa!\nJust you TRY and keep the ball from us!
Here we come!
Wha--?!
Oh no!
Alright!
They stole the ball from Tsubasa!
I mean there were four of 'em, but still!\nThis is Tsubasa we're talking about!
Oh!
Nitta, pass!
Got it!
Here it comes! My Falcon Shot!
What the--?
Th-That shot was insane.
Get it now? That's the power of Otomo!
This year's Nationals will be OUR time to shine!
Listen well, Tsubasa.\nYou won't have that smug look on your face once we\nwipe the floor with you at the prefectural meet!
Just try not to lose before the finals, okay?\nGood luck!
Oh right, and as for you Hyuga.
You talk a big game, but save it for when you've\nbeen the best in Japan at least once. Like me.
What the--
Oh, make sure your beloved disciple,\nTakeshi Sawada, gets the message, too, would ya?
Remind him of how I crushed him at\nNationals in elementary school.
Hahahaha!
C'mon, let's get back to school.
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Back to Otomo?\nDon't tell me you're out for a run?!
That's gotta be like 30 kilometers!
We always run about this far.\nNo big.
Always...?
Later, losers!
...
...
I should be getting back, too.\nI have someone to see.
See ya!
(Those guys are way faster than I remember.)
(Urabe must be telling the truth\nwhen he says they've been at it every day.)
(And that shot Nitta took, too...)
(When I trapped it,\nI felt a numbness shoot up my leg.)
(The clash with Hyuga in elementary school...\nfelt similar. I wonder if it's the same.)
(This year's tournament is shaping up\nto be quite the brawl!)
Don't let it get to you, Tsubasa.
Remember, they needed us and the\nNankatsu Soccer Club to win back in the day.
It took four of 'em to get the ball off you.
Yeah, Tsubasa.
...
Okay, we're switching up teams for\nthe second half of the scrimmage.
I'll join the 1st and 2nd years.\nAnd everyone else is on the other side.
What's all this about?
Just do it! We're starting!
...?
Izawa! Losing the ball in the\nmidfield...
just cost your team a point!
Taki! Is that your only play\non offense?!
Kisugi!\nYou can't even outplay younger\nplayer?!
Ishizaki! Takasugi!
You think a check like that is good\nenough for a Nankatsu\ndefender?! 
Izawa! Losing the ball in the\nmidfield...
just cost your team a point!
Taki! Is that your only play\non offense?!
Kisugi!\nYou can't even outplay younger\nplayer?!
Ishizaki! Takasugi!
You think a check like that is good\nenough for a Nankatsu\ndefender?! 
Morisaki!
Wakabayashi would've caught that one\nright in the chest!
...
What's up with you, Tsubasa?
Yeah, what's with the sudden\nswap to overkill mode?
Are you still thinking about\nwhat happened with Urabe?
...
We...I've gotten careless.
I tried not to, but I got used to winning.\nI started thinking that we could only win.
But after what just happened,\nI realize that's not true.\nI let my arrogance blind me.
And Urabe isn't the only one we need to\nworry about. All the teams are getting better.\nAnd all of them are gunning for us.
Listen, I know we've all been training our butts\noff to win this year.
But the moment we get overconfident, and we start\nto think we got this thing in the bag, that's\nwhen the win slips through our fingers!
...
That's what's buggin' you?
Alright then,\nso what's our next step?
Huh?
You're right, Tsubasa.\nMaybe we've gotten too cocky.
Yeah.\nAnd the only cure for that is more training.
Just give the word, Tsubasa!\nWe're right behind you!
That's right!\nWe're Nankatsu!
You guys...
Alright!\nLet's earn that third championship win!
We hafta give it everything we got!
Tak!

<rep copyright>Yoichi Takahashi/Shueisha 2018 Captain Tsubasa Production Committee <rep copyright>2020 BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc.
What can I do for you, Doctor? Does this have to\ndo with Tsubasa?
Well, I can say a soccer player like\nthat you only see once in a generation.
He could easily become a pillar for the future of\nJapanese soccer, no question.
But that's exactly why he needs to be thinking\nabout his future.
...
From what I hear, Tsubasa wants to\nmove to Brazil, and become a pro player.
Compared to that potential future,\nthis tournament is small potatoes.
No one would bat an eye if he loses once. It's\nnot going to impact what he does from here on out.
But if he plays hurt, and his injuries proceed to\nworsen...
Now, THAT could have a huge effect on his career\nas a soccer player.
So I'm asking you to focus on his potential for\nthe future... as his mother.
If you want to pull him from the game today...
As his physician I can require him to stay here\nand rest.
Indeed.
But before I decide anything, what did Tsubasa\nsay?
Something along the lines of "I'm playing whether\nyou want me to or not."
But--
Then please let him play.
Huh?
If he wants to play, then please let him.
He's worked so hard, and today's game means so\nmuch to him.
If he doesn't play today, I'm certain\nhe'll regret it for the rest of his life.
And even if he loses out there today...
Or if his injuries worsen, and he is then unable\nto live up to his full potential...
Tsubasa isn't the type to ever think,\n"Thank goodness I sat that one out."
That's just...who my boy is.
Mrs. Ozora...
...
Oh! Hello, Sanaé.
Good morning, Ma'am.
I brought Tsubasa's uniform.
Oh, did you? Thank you, dear.
You're tough, Ma'am.
Were it me, I'd probably keep him from playing,\nseeing as he's quite beat up.
Sanaé...
G'morning, everyone.
Oh?
Tsubasa!
Doctor, think you could tape up my shoulder\nfor the game real quick?
The bandage loosened while I was sleeping.
Tsubasa...
Yo, Tsubasa! You ready for this?
Huh? What's with the crowd?
I mean, it is our last game in middle school.
To celebrate, we figured it best we all\nhead out on to the field together!
You guys are the best.
Give me just a moment. I'll be right there!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
You made it this far, so I'll keep this short.\nJust play your best and show 'em what you've got!
All of you fight together as one!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Anything to add, Captain Tsubasa?
R-Right.
I think you all know this already, but when\nI graduated from elementary school I \nwanted to move to Brazil.
So in the beginning I never wanted to\nbecome a part of Nankatsu MS.
But...
But after coming here and playing with you\nguys for the last three years, I'm glad I did.\nReally. It's been everything to me.
This is our last game, so let's play to win!\nLet's emblazon our legend on the history of\nthis tournament with a third victory!
No duh! Like we'd ever lose with you here!
We'll send ya off to Brazil with a\nperfect win record to get ya started!
We're taking that banner back to\nShizuoka again!
Alright, listen up guys.
Today, you're up against Nankatsu. It's no\nshocker to any of you that they'll be a step up\nfrom the rest of our competition so far.
But with the skills you've honed, this is a game\nwe can win. Believe in yourselves!
Roger!
Absolutely!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Wakashimazu, have you worked out how to stop the\nDrive Shot?
I think so. I've been studying video of it to see\nif there was a way.
The Drive Shot flies way above the goal and then\nplummets down to just below the top bar.
So if I back up right to the mouth\nof the goal and jump at the right\ntime, I should be able to stop it.
But the strength and speed of the shot are way\nbeyond anything else. The timing will be tricky to\nsay the least.
So I had the captain take some shots last night.\nYou know the one.
That shot's about the same strength as the Drive\nShot, and Hyuga was able to feed me one after\nanother.
So I think now I've got the muscle memory to try\nto pull that kind of power out of the air.
I'm not gonna let his Drive Shot beat me!
Great. I knew if anyone could do it, it would be\nyou, Wakashimazu. We're counting on you!
Okay!
Alright guys, this is the year we defeat\nNankatsu! Toho Academy's bringing\nthe championship banner home!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
C'mon, let's do this guys!
Tak!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
(Hyuga.)
(I'm entrusting you with leading Toho to\nvictory.)
We're at the National MS Soccer Tournament\nfinals, Nankatsu vs Toho, and the crowd's\nshowing us some incredible energy!
If those team names sound familiar, it's because\nthis is the third time we've seen this finals\nmatchup in as many years!
Nankatsu has won the last two years, but will we\nsee them maintain their streak and beat Toho once\nagain for three National championships?
Or is the third time the charm for Toho? Can they\nfinally assert dominance over Nankatsu, and take\nthe championship for themselves?
Both teams are presenting their starting line-ups.
In the white, representing Shizuoka, Nankatsu MS!
Nankatsu's Captain Tsubasa Ozora is shrugging off\nhis injuries to stand on the field with his team\nonce again!
And on the other side, in the black jerseys...\nRepresenting Tokyo, Toho--
What a shocking development! Their ace striker,\nKojiro Hyuga, is finally making his debut for this\nyear's tournament in the final match!
Today's match will be a showdown between two aces\nwith promising futures in the sport!\nTsubasa Ozoraaa and Kojiro Hyugaaa!
No doubt the next sixty minutes on this field\nwill be a precursor providing insight into\ninnumerable unforgettable battles in their future!
When that whistle blows, the teams will be\nkicking off into the match of the century!
(Good. You came, Tsubasa.)
(Were you not here, there would\nbe little point to this match.)
(This year we pay you back for\nthe last two. This year... Toho's taking\nthe championship!)
(You're gonna be beggin' me for mercy\nbefore this is over Tsubasa.)
Chew on this, Nankatsu! Taste my Tiger Shot!
Chew on this, Nankatsu!
Taste my...
(I knew it! I knew Hyuga'd come outta\nthe gates full tilt.)
Tiger Shot!
S-So fast!
Ah--!
C-Come on!
Wh-What in the world?! The ball hit the goal post\nso hard it burst!
That's Hyuga's Tiger Shot! What a beast!
C'mon, Tsubasa! Show me that\nDrive Shot!
It's not gettin' past me today! Uaaah!
Wha--?!
He stopped it!
The Drive Shot has been blocked!
How did he...?
What in the...?!
But what's this? The ball never stopped spinning!
And Wakashimazu is driven backwards!
How in the...?!
(Gah... My left arm's funny.)
(Is it from blocking that\nshot?)
(The Tiger Shot goes in a\nstraight line.)
(So if I return it head on...!)
Drive Shot!
Y-You...!
A-Amazing! Tsubasa has kicked the\nTiger Shot right back and scored!
It...It went in...
Wh-What the heck?!
Takeshi! I'm not letting you pass\nthe ball to Hyuga!
It's on, Tsubasa!
You're not getting past us!
Captain! Just focus on\nscoring!
All eyes have turned to Tsubasa and Hyuga, as we\nenter halftime with Toho in the lead! Hyuga's\nhunger for the win is plain as day!
For Nankatsu, however, this is a tough start to\nthe final game. Will they recover and claim their\nthird championship win?
All eyes have turned to Tsubasa and Hyuga, as we\nenter halftime with Nankatsu ahead! What a strong\nstart toward their third win!
Can Toho turn it around in the second half?
All eyes are on Tsubasa and Hyuga's\nshowdown as we go into halftime at a\ndeadlock with the teams tied!
There was some high pressure offense in the first\nhalf, but expect to see them turn it up even\nmore going into the next half!
Ugh...!
Hey! Tsubasa!
Get him to the doctor! Quick!
Doctor, my leg just started hurting when--
Of course it hurts! I told you not to push it to\nfar, didn't I?!
But... I could never beat Hyuga without going all\nout.
I didn't come to lose!
Tsubasa...
Please... Give me something to take the edge off.
Painkillers?! You complete moron!
We only use those for adult players,\nand even then very sparingly. Your\nyoung body is still developing.
Please, Doctor!
Without me, Nankatsu will...
Tsubasa, your obsession with this\ntournament isn't healthy.
You want to go pro in Brazil, right? You want to\ntake home the World Cup for Japan, right?
Compared to that, this middle school tournament\nisn't nearly as important. It's just peanuts.
If you play injured now, you might take yourself\noff the pitch for good.
Are you certain you won't regret this?
...It's part of my dream.
Huh?
Even if it is just peanuts, I have dreamt a long\ntime of winning here on this day.
I swore I'd win all three championships in\nmiddle school with my team at Nankatsu.
This is OUR dream!
Tsubasa...
If I don't win this... Then why did I stay in\nJapan after elementary school? I won't waste the\nopportunity.
Roberto... didn't take me with him, so instead\nI must... I must...
I must win this tournament! I have to win this\nfinal championship with the teammates I've made\nthe journey of the past three years with!
That's been my drive. That's been my reason!
...I understand. If that's how far you're willing\nto go, then I won't stand in your way.
But next time you look ready to faint, you're\ndone. You're off the field.
Got that, Tsubasa?
Racja!
It's no use, we just can't win!
Th-They're too good!
We're no match for them!
Toho was already good, and now with\nHyuga pressuring our defenders? It's like\nthey're the perfect team.
Yeah, that Tiger Shot just ain't fair.
Tak! What do we do about that?
If only Wakabayashi were here...
C'mon, stop talking like that. You're our\nkeeper Morisaki, not Wakabayashi.\nIt's what you do.
Tsubasa...
And the same goes for the rest of you.\nStop talking like we're dead and buried.
I don't understand where all this whining is\ncoming from. If you can't handle the\ncompetition...
Then get off the field!
Tsubasa...
Is your memory so short-lived?
This is our dream! This is why we're here!
OUR...
Dream.
Tell me I'm wrong.
Three championships at Nationals!\nOur mark on history! Am I mistaken?\nIs that not what we're doing here?
Is that not our dream? Something only we\ncan ever achieve, right here and now?
Tsu-Tsubasa...
You're right, Tsubasa. We're with you.
Tak! We can't give up on our dream\njust like that!
Especially when you've given so much\nboth in body and spirit.
Eyes on the prize all the way!
Tsubasa!
Tsubasa!
Captain Tsubasa!
Captain Tsubasa!
Captain Tsubasa!
Captain Tsubasa!
Captain Tsubasa!
Captain Tsubasa!
Now, let's get out there, guys! It's time.
We can still take home that\nthird championship!
In this second half, we make\nour dream a reality.
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Alright, let's give them a proper thrashing!
Toho won't know what hit 'em!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Hey, Tsubasa! You holding up okay?!
Yeah, I'm fine. I just got back from a little\nvisit with the doc. I'm still good for the second\nhalf.
Really? Glad to hear it!
But don't overdo it, okay? You can\nrely on us when you need to!
Yeah, thanks for saying so.
(Thank you, Ishizaki.)
(You were my first friend when\nI moved to Nankatsu City.)
(And you were one of the reasons I chose to go to\nNankatsu instead of Toho when offered.)
(Because you were here.)
Tsubasa you're freakin' me out.\nDon't just stare at me like that.\nIt's weird and embarrassing!
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to...
Now, let's get ready to rumble!
Tak! We're doing it, everyone!
It's been a long time coming, but that third\nchampionship is just at our fingertips.
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Time to make things happen!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
You guys did great in the first half.
So just keep it up in the second one.
Focus on getting your captain the ball, and let\nthe pummeling proceed.
Coach...
Looks like even Coach missed Hyuga a bit.
...
So what's wrong, Wakashimazu?
Ummm...
You've been acting off for a while. What's up?
...Sorry. Looks like an old injury from\nelementary school is dogging me a bit.
What...?
Wakashimazu!
If you're hurt...
But don't worry. It just stings a little. I can\nplay.
And even if I had to tie one arm behind\nmy back, I wouldn't let Nankatsu get one\npast me, anyway.
So don't get all mushy on me! We're Toho!\nWe're the best. And it's time to remind\neveryone of that.
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
(You used to be the quiet one,\nWakashimazu, but here you are, giving\npep talks like a true leader...)
(When I was benched, you picked up\nthe reins, and drove this team to victory\nagain and again.)
(Maybe not just you...)
(When everyone told me to let the\ndefenders do their thing without me,\nyou faced Tsubasa like a beast, Takeshi.)
(Without me around... Y'all\ngot really good really fast.)
Total pressure, guys! We're\ngonna mount an offense to give\nWakashimazu a little breathing room!
Attack, attack, attack! That's the game plan\nfor the second half!
Right, Captain!
Right, Captain!
Right, Captain!
Right, Captain!
Right, Captain!
Right, Captain!
Here we go! Round two!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
We're about to take our first championship!
Alright folks, we're about to begin the second\nhalf of the finals!
Can Toho maintain their lead and win their first\nchampionship? Or will Nankatsu make a comeback\nand achieve a third victory over Toho!
We'll find out soon!
Alright folks, we're about to begin the second\nhalf of the finals!
Can Nankatsu maintain their lead and achieve\nanother victory? Or will Toho make a comeback and\nwin their first championship?
We'll find out soon!
Alright folks, we're about to begin the second\nhalf of the finals!
We've got Nankatsu aiming for their third\nchampionship win, and Toho gunning for their\nfirst! What tricks do the teams have in store?!
We'll find out soon!
Remember this! Tiger Shot!
Gyaaah!
You okay, Tsubasa?!
Guh... I'm... not... gonna... fall...!
Tsu-Tsubasa!
Let's get in there!
C'mon! We can't let Tsubasa\nhog all the glory!
Darn right! This is OUR dream!
(I'm sorry, Roberto... I've\nreached my limit.)
Whoa there! What's wrong with Tsubasa?! He seems to be slowing waaay down on the pitch!
(Tsubasa?!)
(No! You can't run out of gas!)
(I gave it my all, guys...)
(So even if we can't pull this off...)
Is that really as far as you go?
Oh...!
Okay, Tsubasa! Time to settle this\nonce and for all!
Hy-Hyuga is aiming his Tiger Shot like a cannon\nright at Tsubasa! How will Tsubasa handle this in\nhis current condition?
Hyuga...?
Right. There's still a little ways to go.
And Tsubasa seems to have sprung back to life!\nTruly, a phoenix!
I'll settle this with the\nDrive Shot!
(I'm not going down.)
(I'll score from here!)
Tiger Shot!
What?!
This is the final shot!
How?!
Uaaah!
Ngh!
We won't lose this championship!\nNot to Tsubasa, and not to Nankatsu!
H-He stopped it! Hyuga caught Wakashimazu!
H-He stopped it! Hyuga caught Wakashimazu!
Toho Academy made the save!\nNankatsu's shot didn't go in!
Toho Academy made the save!\nNankatsu's shot didn't go in!
After sixty minutes of desperate fighting,\nneither team has managed to take the lead!
The National finals, Nankatsu vs Toho, is headed\nto overtime!
Alright guys, we're in overtime.
Tsu-Tsubasa...
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm sorry Tsubasa, but I can't allow you to go on.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
What?
Huh?
Huh?
B-But Doctor!
The doctor's right, Tsubasa. You've\ndone more than enough already.
Just leave the rest to your teammates.\nYou need to focus on recovery now.
Exactly. As a doctor, I cannot allow any more of\nthis.
Now, we're going to go to the infirmary.
But Doctor... Didn't you make me a promise?
Huh?
I... I'm still on my feet.
Dude...
I'm begging you... Please let me see this through.
For a moment back there, I really did think I was\ndone. But then Hyuga's Tiger Shot shook me out\nof it.
I am not at my limit. I can go further.
I have to go back out there. I owe it to Hyuga,\nas well. I can't quit inches from the finish line.
Let me play in overtime! Please...
Hyuga came here to settle our rivalry. And until\nmy body finally falls to the grass, I have to keep\nmoving and keep putting up a fight.
And this is for everyone at Nankatsu, too.\nEveryone I came here with, believing we could go\nhome with a third victory at Nationals...
Please...Let me play in overtime!
But Tsubasa...
Doc, please let us play with Tsubasa until that\nlast whistle blows!
Well...
Ishizaki...
Coach, Doctor...I don't know how we could\nexpress how we feel any more clearly.
Once Tsubasa's last good play is done,\nwhen he'd just hold us back, we'll\nswitch him out.
But until then... We still need him!
E-Everyone...
...Fine. I'll trust you to keep\nhis best interests in mind.
Thank you, Coach.
C'mon, Tsubasa. Take a breather\non the bench.
You'll need all the stamina you can get.
Thanks, Ishizaki.
We keep up the pace to the very last kick,\nuntil we win the--
Until we achieve our dream.\nRight, Tsubasa?
Yeah. That's right.
Oh, Sanaé...
Tsubasa...Good luck.
Here, you'll need this. It's the captain's pin.
...Yeah. Thanks.
Okay.
Alright, overtime begins with the ball in\nNankatsu's possession.
(I've been relying too much on the\nDrive Shot this match.)
(And by relying on the Drive Shot,\nthat means I'm still relying on Roberto.)
(Dribbling, passing, and even the Drive Shot.\nThese were Roberto's gifts to me.)
(I feel like I've just been a faithful disciple.)
(Well, not just to Roberto.)
(Misaki... Wakabayashi... Ishizaki... The whole\nteam, and even Sanaé. Everyone... Just\neveryone...)
(Everyone's helped me get this far.)
(But after this, I'll be on my own.)
(After we win here and I move to Brazil,\nI'll be alone.)
(Thank you, everyone. Thank you for everything.)
(Tsubasa Ozora, fifteen years old. Scoring one\nlast goal in Japan, before departing.)
And that's game! Nankatsu MS has won their third\nconsecutive championship at Nationals!
Toho challenged them three times, and all three\ntimes were unable to overtake Nankatsu!
Tsubasa, we did it!\nWe really won three times!
The fantasy is a part of real history now.
It's over...
Tsubasa!
Hyuga.
Our final showdown...and you still beat me.
In the end, I didn't win once... Maybe\nI never had a chance to begin with.
No, don't you remember? In the second\nhalf, you did. When you aimed your\nTiger Shot at me. If...
If you'd taken that shot at the goal instead,\nToho could be celebrating right now.
Tsubasa!
But you chose to take a shot at me, so I\nhave no regrets leaving this field today.
Thanks, Hyuga.
Tsubasa...
You're right though.
I let my team down, and chose you...\nchose to try and settle a personal score,\ninstead.
Guess I'm not cut out to be a captain.
Captain...
But because you were there...
Hmmm?
But because you were there, because\nI couldn't stand losing to you, I could\ngive it my all these last three years.
Thank you.
Tsubasa...
I wanted to play you at your best though.
Sorry, man.
Now get your butt to Brazil already.
Hmmm?
Cuz I'm sick of seeing you in Japan.
I've not been able to see past you\nfor so long.
Man...
Well, at least this chapter in\nour battle is over.
Yep yep.
And now we see both captains, Tsubasa and Hyuga,
exchanging jerseys to commemorate this\nunforgettable match!
At the end of a long rivalry, both players are\nsmiling, unburdened by regret!
(Tsubasa, how did you manage to stay\njust out of reach?)
(I think I get it now.)
(Everyone's talking 'bout you\nheading to Brazil to go pro.)
(Extravagant goals make soccer fun.)
(So why is giving you a good\nthrashing all I can think about?\nWhy am I always chasing you?)
(What if I'd looked beyond Tsubasa?\nWhat if I'd dreamed bigger?)
(What if--)
(Congrats, Tsubasa.)
(I know I've got more left to do, too.)
(And when the time comes, we can...)
Thanks for everything, Tsubasa.
How do you mean?
Our dream came true.
But now it's time for you to chase\none of yours. One you set aside\nto help us realize ours.
Go to Brazil and make it big, Tsubasa.\nWe all know you can.
Aw man, you guys...
Thank you.\nThank you, everyone. For everything.
Tsubasa...
Well, Tsubasa.
Sanaé...
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Thanks for everything, Sanaé.
Make sure you let your injuries heal.
They're handing over the championship banner!
The crimson championship banner was just given to\nNankatsu MS's Captain Tsubasa!
Tsubasaaa!
We won this banner together!
Tsubasa!
Tsubasa!
(So it wasn't just my imagination.)
(These three years have been a journey of self\ndiscovery for them. They've been growing since I\nsaw them playing on that seaside soccer pitch...)
(And since that time, other talented players have\nemerged from the shadows.)
(With them, we could form a world-class team.\nTheir era has finally arrived.)
(A band of rivals turned allies, led by Tsubasa\nand Hyuga.)
(And this time, it'll be on the world stage.)
(You'll need to support each other as you spread\nyour wings into the wide world of soccer, with new\npotential and fierce rivals.)
And that's game! Toho has finally done it,\nand finally done away with Nankatsu's\nmulti-year reign!
Nankatsu's dream of a third championship win is\nover!
As you'd expect from a game determining\nthe best in the nation, the competition\nis close and fierce!
Will Nankatsu earn a historic third victory, or\nwill Toho finally clench their first?
The crowd watches expectantly as overtime is set\nto begin!
There's also another possibility: If even in\novertime there's no winner decided, both\nteams will be crowned champion!
Nankatsu starts the first half of overtime with\nthe kickoff!
You think you're getting this\nball to our goal?
(Tsubasa! You can't be thinking of\ntaking them on alone!)
(It's just like when we first\nmet!)
Tsubasa! You're not alone!
Your friends are here!
Ishizaki...
That's right, Tsubasa!
(It's not just me... Everyone's here with me.)
(Even in Brazil, I won't be all on my own.)
That's right, Tsubasa!
(It's not just me... Everyone's here with me.)
(Even in Brazil, I won't be all on my own.)
(My final shot...)
This is my farewell shot!
It's mine!
It's not gettin' past me!
Awww! Tsubasa took a shot...
But it doesn't look like it's going in!
What?!
H-He did it! That was some kind of miracle shot!
Tsubasa uses the Drive Shot to perform what can\nonly be described as miraculous!
I-I did it! YES!
Y-You got it in!
Nice one, Tsubasa!
We made it happen!
Nankatsu is gathering around Tsubasa in\ncelebration!
Everything was riding on that shot and in true\nTsubasa fashion, he did not disappoint!\nWhat an athlete!
And Nankatsu squeaks into the\nlead in the start of overtime!
But can they defend it until the very end?
And that's the first half of overtime!
Neither team is giving an inch! Who will come out\non top?
And Toho steals the lead for the first half of\novertime!
This must be painful for Nankatsu,\nafter coming so close to the win!
Ugh...
Tsubasa!
You okay, Tsubasa?!
Guys...
What's wrong, Tsubasa?
I... I want to play in the last half, too.
Huh?
But... I can tell I'm slowing down.
If you guys think I should sit this one out... if\nyou think I'll be dead weight... I will sit out.
Tsubasa...
But... I want to play.\nI want to play to the end.
Then play, Tsubasa.
...Huh?
Yeah, get on the grass with us.
We came this far together, let's finish it\ntogether!
Is... Is this really alright, guys?\nAre you sure?
Duh!
You're our captain!
Ugh...
Tsubasa!
Tsubasa, that's enough. Your body can't take any\nmore abuse.
But Coach! I... I can still play!
Enough is enough!
You too, Doc?
You're going too far.
Your real dream isn't to win this tournament!\nIt's to go to Brazil and become the world's\ngreatest soccer star!
Wha--!
Y-You're right... But... \nthat's why I need to play!
That's part of those hopes and dreams, too.\nDefeat is not an option.
I have to play! I have to win!
Tsubasa!
Let him play.
Huh?
Please, let Tsubasa stay in the game.
More than winning or losing... What Tsubasa can't\nstand most is not getting to play.
Please don't take soccer away from him!
Sanaé...
Nakazawa...
...I'll take full responsibility.
Even if it kills me!
I'm not the sort to back down at a\ntime like this. And I'm far from done.
If it ended for me here, going to Brazil...\nWinning the World Cup for Japan... Becoming the\nworld's best soccer player...
Those dreams all wouldn't happen. But I'm\ngoing to see that they do.
Aw, man...
Tsubasa...
I... I need to do this!
Tak! Let's finish this together, Tsubasa!
We came all this way together,\nseems like it'd be a shame not\nto see it through.
Until this game is done,\nwe're sticking together.
(Why, Tsubasa...?)
(Why are you still going when\nyou can barely stand?)
(Where do you get this strength?\nWhat well could go so deep?)
(Dreams? Friendship? Is that enough...?)
(Then why...?)
(Why can't I beat you, Tsubasa?!)
(No matter how much I bare my fangs\nor flash my claws, no matter how strong\nmy teammates have become...)
(Am I just destined never to win\nagainst you?)
(My one and only goal... Tsubasa Ozora.)
(Someone... Someone tell me.)
(How do I win? I'll do anything.)
(How do I reach that level?)
Everything that needed to be said has been said.\nJust play your best, and leave it all on the field\nwith no regrets.
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Hyuga.
Right.
The moment I put you back in, I was leaving the\ngame in your hands.
I'm counting on you.
...
Right.
Alright folks, this is the final half of the\nfinal game's overtime! One way or another,\nwe're about to get our champions!
And amidst the cheers, Toho\nstarts us off with the kickoff!
(Is it really going to happen again?\nAm I gonna lose to Tsubasa\nagain?)
(...)
(If... If I can't become\nTsubasa...)
(Then I... I just have to stick with the old\nKojiro Hyuga style of playing\nsoccer!)
(I'm sick of how this keeps\nending.)
(It's not working... My technique just\nisn't good enough.)
(But I can't stop now. Not until the final\nwhistle!)
Stop it, Hyuga!
Łoł! Hyuga was just stopped...
By his teammate, Sawada!
(Th-That's it!)
Takeshi! Point your feet over here!
Huh?
What?!
(This is Tsubasa's style...)
(No, this is REAL soccer!)
Oof!
Oh no you don't!
Aaah!
My word! Both Morisaki and Tsubasa have been\npushed into the goal!
What remarkable tenacity from Kojiro Hyuga,\nthe Fierce Tiger has reemerged! Nankatsu couldn't\ncage him, as he blasted in a last second goal!
Hyuga!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
(I can't explain it. But this is it.\nIt makes sense.)
(This is why Tsubasa keeps playing\nthrough those injuries.)
(Because... this is fun.)
(Above all, he just loves the game.)
(When he's playing, he's free.\nHe uses his own judgment\nand his own ideas.)
(You can play how you want. Untethered.)
(I've been thinking so small with\nmy sights set only on Tsubasa.)
(Tsubasa never saw me that way. What he\nwas doing was always more.)
We're knockin' on victory's door!\nHang in there!
We're so close! Now's the\ntime!
Iron will and laser focus\nguys!
The clock's still ticking!\nKeep kicking!
Keep your feet moving!
It's not over until the\nwhistle blows!
And that's the game!
Looks like this rivalry isn't over! It's a draw!
As of this moment, both teams are champion!
And that's the game!
The turbulent turmoil on the soccer turf is over!
Nankatsu are the three time champs!
And that's the game!
Toho has finally clawed out their own National\nchampionship victory!
Nankatsu just couldn't put it all together for\nthat third championship victory!
Tsubasa, we did it! We won! Our third\nchampionship!
We've done what no one else has!
Hyuga! We won!
It's finally done...
Tsubasa.
Hyuga.
This was our last match. And I couldn't win.
We tied.
Y-Yeah.
Tsubasa, we did it! We won! Our third\nchampionship!
We've done what no one else has!
It's finally done...
Tsubasa.
Hyuga.
This was our last match.\nAnd I still couldn't win.
In the end, I didn't win once... Maybe\nI never had a chance to begin with.
No, don't you remember? In the second\nhalf, you did. When you aimed your\nTiger Shot at me. If...
If you'd taken that shot at the goal instead,\nToho could be celebrating right now.
Tsubasa.
But you chose to take a shot at me, so I\nhave no regrets leaving this field today.
Thanks, Hyuga.
Tsubasa...
You're right, though.
I let my team down, and chose you...\nchose to try and settle a personal score,\ninstead.
Guess I'm not cut out to be a captain.
Captain...
But because you were there...
Hmmm?
But because you were there,\nbecause I couldn't stand losing to you,\nI could give it my all these last three years.
Thank you.
Tsubasa...
I wanted to play you at your best though.
Sorry, man.
Now get your butt over to Brazil already.
Huh?
Cuz I'm sick of seeing you in Japan.
I've not been able to see past you\nfor so long.
Hyuga...
But I think I made a breakthrough today.\nIt was the first time in a long while\nthat I had fun playing.
You're not my target anymore.\nIt's not all about beating you.
After today, I'm gonna aim for something\nbigger. Just like you do.
I see.
Still not sure what that'll be though.
After today's match, I realized\nwhy I couldn't win against you.
I've been chasing your heels for so long,\nTsubasa.
But that's not enough. That's not soccer.\nI get that now.
After today, I'm gonna aim for\nsomething bigger. Just like you do.
I see.
Still not sure what that'll be though.
Hyuga, I...
I'm going to Brazil after middle school.
Tsubasa.
Hyuga.
Well, at least this chapter in our\nbattle is over.
Yeah.
And now we see both captains, Tsubasa and Hyuga,
exchanging jerseys to commemorate this\nunforgettable match!
At the end of a long rivalry, both players are\nsmiling, unburdened by regret!
Thanks for everything, Tsubasa.
Hmmm?
Our dream came true.
But now it's time for you to chase\none of yours. One you set aside\nto help us realize ours.
Go to Brazil and make it big,\nTsubasa. We all know you can.
I don't know what to say...
Thank you, everyone.\nThank you for everything.
Tsubasa...
Tsubasa.
Sanaé...
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Thanks for everything, Sanaé.
Make sure you let your injuries heal.

MS Team Details
Wygraj, zdobywając więcej punktów niż twój przeciwnik.\nDrybluj za pomocą <rep ⑲> i krótkiego podania za pomocą <rep ②>\n aby przebić się przez formację przeciwnika.
When playing on defense, press <rep ①> or <rep ⑧>\nto activate a Tackle Move against your\nopponent. This can reduce the opponent's\nSpirit. If you succeed, you can steal\nthe ball from the opponent. The\neffectiveness of Tackle Moves varies\ngreatly depending on the user's stats.
Przytrzymaj <rep dribble_hold> podczas dryblingu,\naby wykonać Dash Dribble.
Naciśnij <rep ⑧> podczas Dryblingu, aby aktywować \nunikalny Dribble Move. Dash Dribbling and \nDribble Moves mogą być używane do omijania\nprzeciwników.
Naciśnij <rep ③> gdy masz piłkę, aby oddać \nstrzał na bramkę. Przytrzymanie przycisku spowoduje napełnienie \nWskaźnika Kopnięcia, a im dłużej go przytrzymasz, \ntym mocniejszy będzie strzał.
Shooting Moves można aktywować poprzez napełnienie Wskaźnika \nKopnięć do pełna, gdy Wskaźnik Ducha znajduje się \nokreślonej wartości. Shooting Moves różnią się w zależności od gracza, \nale wszystkie znacznie osłabiają Ducha \nbramkarza przeciwnika.
Duch jest potrzebny do wykonywania specjalnych akcji.\nKażda akcja zużywa Wskaźnik Ducha. Będzie powoli\nsię regenerować gdy będziesz poruszać się normalnie i nie\nużywać specjalnych ruchów.
Short Pass with <rep ②>.\nA Short Pass will send the ball to a nearby \nteammate, and you will switch to controlling \nthe teammate who receives the ball.
Press <rep ④> for a Through Pass.\nThis pass can reach a teammate ahead of you.\nThe target of the pass changes depending \non how long you hold <rep ④>.
When using a Short Pass with <rep change_hold>+<rep ②>\nthe passing player runs ahead.\nHold down <rep ④> after making a pass with\n<rep ②> to have the other player return\nthe ball with a one-two pass.
You can Long Pass with <rep ①>.\nA Long Pass will kick the ball down field to \ndistant teammates.The distance of the pass \ndepends on how long you hold the button.
Hold <rep dribble_hold> in order to speed\nup your dribble by consuming Spirit.\nYou can dodge the opponent's tackle\n(<rep ①>/<rep ⑧>) by using Spirit,\nbut the ball will be stolen if you're\nout of Spirit.
Be careful, if both you and the opponent are dashing\nwith <rep dribble_hold> when you meet, the ball will be\nstolen.
Press <rep ⑧> to consume Spirit and activate a Dribble Move.\nThis can dodge any opponent you run into,\nincluding ones who are dashing with <rep dribble_hold>.
Be careful. If you are hit by an opponent's tackle\n(<rep ①>/<rep ⑧>) while using a Dribble Move\nwith <rep ⑧>, the ball can be stolen.
Activate a V-Zone by pressing <rep ⑦> when\nthe V-Zone Gauge is full while on offense.\nWhen a V-Zone is active, all teammates will\nrecover Spirit faster, the Kick Gauge will\nfill faster, along with other effects\ndepending on the team captain.
The goalkeeper's Spirit is depleted by stopping an \nopponent's shot. The lower the keeper's Spirit, the \nmore likely a shot is to succeed, so pay close \nattention to how much your keeper has.
The goalkeeper's Spirit recovers whenever\nthe opponent manages to score,\nas well as when you enter halftime.
Successfully evading two opponents \nin a row while Dribbling will activate a \nZone. While in the Zone, effects are \nactive for a limited time.
A Critical Defense lets you successfully \ntackle an opponent who is filling their \nKick Gauge. Critical Defenses fill the \nV-Zone Gauge more than other plays, \nso keep an eye out for opportunities.
A Captain Skill is a special skill available only to\nthe player designated as captain, which activates\nin V-Zones. Many of these skills grant powerful \nbonuses to the entire team.
Players with Block Moves can activate them for half \ntheir Spirit by standing directly in front of a player \nusing a Shooting Move. When activated, the power \nof the shot decreases. If the power reaches zero, \nthe ball will also be stolen.
If two players approach a\nloose ball using <rep ⑥>/<rep ⑧>, or one\nplayer approaches another with\nthe Kick Gauge at max using\n<rep ①>/<rep ⑧>, both will scramble for\nthe ball in a Duel. Repeatedly\npress the button on screen to\nfill the gauge and win.\nPlayer stats affect how fast\nthe gauge fills.
Winning a Duel fills the V-Zone Gauge greatly \nand activates a powerful shot or long pass \nimmediately. Duels can also activate from \nairborne plays.
When the ball goes out of bounds, it will be returned\nfrom the same side. Press <rep ④>/<rep ②> for a \nshort throw or <rep ①>/<rep ③> for a long throw. \nDistance also depends on how long you hold the \nbutton. Press <rep ⑤> to change thrower.
When the offensive kicks the ball over the goal line, \nthe goalkeeper kicks it back into play from the goal. \nThe controls are the same as when passing. You \ncannot shoot or use Shooting Moves at\nthis time.
When the defender hits the ball over\nthe goal line, it is kicked back into play.\nKick the ball with <rep ①> or <rep ②>.
Whenever there is an Offside,\nplay is resumed with a kick from the\nplace where it stopped. You can kick\nthe ball in the direction of the arrow.
You can activate a Long Pass Move from a free kick\nby pointing the arrow at a teammate and using <rep ①>, or when using Combo Pass Moves with a\nteammate who has them, use <rep ④>.
Penalty Kicks occur when there's a penalty\nshootout due to the score being tied at the end of\na match. The kicker has a limited time to choose a\nshot trajectory from one of 6 directions\n(up-right, straight up, up-left, down-right,\nstraight down, or down-left) and cannot use\nShooting Moves.
The goalkeeper selects an area to defend before the\nkicker shoots. If the area overlaps with the trajectory,\nthe save is successful. If the height of the ball is \ndifferent, it may reach the goal. Higher player stats \nmake winning a Penalty Kick more likely.
Use Manage Team to change which players\nwill be on the field, their formation,\nand their tactics. You can make \nchanges from the Pre-Game Screen.
Skills are abilities that each player possesses. \nSome Skills are always active during a match, \nwhile others activate under certain\nconditions.
The strength of a Dribble Move can vary greatly,\ndepending on the abilities of the player.\nCheck the move descriptions to see\nwhich stats affect which move.\nThe strength of this influence is split\ninto five levels: S, A, B, C, and D.
The effects of a Shooting Move are divided into a\nnumber of categories. Power and Speed are graded\non a scale, with SSS being the highest for Power\nand S for Speed. Drop Off measures how much power\nis lost while the ball travels to the\ngoal.
Trajectory Types indicate the path the ball will take on\nthe way to the goal. Range is the distance from the\ngoal that the move can be activated. Too far and the\nit will become a normal shot, instead. Some moves\nwill also veer off course if you're too\nclose.
Some keepers can activate a Super Save\nby pressing <rep ⑦> when the V-Zone Gauge is\nfull and the opponent uses a Shooting\nMove. This will use up all of your\nV-Zone Gauge, but is guaranteed to\ndefend the goal. Save it for those\ndefensive emergencies.
Activate a Long Pass Move by holding\n<rep deci_hold> and releasing when\nKick Gauge is full. Great for moving\nthe ball far up to the front line.\nThe trajectory and effects of the\npass depend on the move used.
You can give commands to your entire team by\npressing any <rep ⑱> during a match to assign\ntactics. Sometimes tactics can have complex\nsetups, such as assigning specific players.\nYou can choose up to four tactics from the\nManage Team menu.
There are Hidden Shot Moves that can change\nthe properties of a Shooting Move by holding\ndown <rep ⑤> when it's activated. These moves have\na ☆ in front of their names.
Press <rep shoot_hold> toward a midair ball to shoot\nan Aerial Shot. This allows a quick attack before\ncompeting for the ball on the ground. Some players\ncan use Shooting Moves in midair by filling\nthe Kick Gauge to max, same as on the\nground.
You can fire a powerful Combo Shot by\nholding <rep shoot_hold> to charge the Kick Gauge and\nreleasing when it's full with a suitable\nteammate nearby.
Activate Combo Pass Moves by holding\n<rep thru_hold> to fill the Kick Gauge and releasing\nwhen it's full with a suitable\nteammate nearby.

You didn't get a chance to play, did you\n<avatar_name>
...Not that we weren't pretty pathetic out there\nourselves.
Coach should've let me play!
I wouldn't have made a difference anyway.
Everyone did their best.
If only we'd all been out there!
You really shouldn't say that sort of thing...\nEven if that's really how you feel.
Just hold that feeling in your chest and keep\npracticing, so you get your chance next time,\ngot it?
...If that's how you really feel,\nthen I'm disappointed in you, <avatar_name>.
You'll be warming that bench to the end of days,\nunless you start to value your presence on the\npitch.
...And that's the problem.
It means we just aren't good enough to take on the\nworld.
...Maybe. But for that to happen,\nyou need to work on your skills.
If you want to be out there on the field with us,\nyou'll need to practice even harder than you are\nnow.



























































Looks like it's finally time to strut\nyour stuff on the field, <avatar_name>.
Show us everything you've got!




Hey! About practice tonight...
I'm sorry! Can we cancel it?
We've been doing our math homework, but since me\nand Masao got stuck on the same problems,\nthe teacher wants us to relearn it.
I really wish we could focus on soccer,\nbut we can't exactly ignore our schoolwork.
We plan to go to the same high school, but it'd be\npretty embarrassing if one of us got accepted and\nthe other didn't.
Sometimes being twins is such a pain.
So anyway, that's why. Sorry, we'll have to train\ntogether some other time!




























































































































<avatar_name>!\nSo you're finally in the starting lineup!
Now's your chance to show us what you've got!\nGive us your best plays!































<avatar_name>!\nSo you're finally in the starting lineup!
Now's your chance to show us what you've got!\nGive us your best plays!
We're heading to train with Jito.\nWhat about you, <avatar_name>?
Of course, I'm coming with you!
I'd like to iron out some stuff alone.
I don't need to practice!
Perfect. Idziemy!
Actually, we've been working on something\nthat'll knock your socks off!
Oh, okay. It's probably a good idea to focus on\nyour own training once in a while.
Well, good luck then!\nIf you need help with something, just ask!
What was that?!
You've been a starting member for one game\nand you're already getting cocky?
Forget him, Masao. Jito's waiting.
Y-Yeah...
Later!
Got a minute, <avatar_name>?
Your attitude at practice has been awful lately!\nWhat's going on?
You're not letting it get to your head that\nyou're a regular starter for Japan, are you?
Don't be jealous of my talent.
Ah, sorry. I'll try to be more focused.
Like either of you could do anything\non your own.
I can't believe you!
You've got skill. I'll give you that.
But I'll tell you one thing.\nWhile you're sitting there twiddling your thumbs,\nsome hard worker is gonna blow by you.
Let's go, Masao.
Yeah.
Good, as long as you understand.
You've only made it this far because of all\nthe training you've put in.\nHave you already forgotten that?
What're you...?!
...You've changed, <avatar_name>.
There's no point in even being angry with you.\nLet's go, Masao.
Yeah.















You're pretty motivated all of a sudden,\n<avatar_name>.
Yeah. Not that I'm complaining,\nbut did something happen?



Seriously, what happened to you, <avatar_name>?
You weren't like this before.

You've been so into your training these days.\nIt's like you're back to your old self.
But... why?
Actually...
Coach talked to me...
Oh, really?
He did? Tell us what happened!
Coach!

I heard from <avatar_name> that you\ngave him some guidance about his attitude.
Thank you so much!







I should be thanking you two.
I should be thanking you two.
Sure, why not!
We'll keep on giving this our all!














































You're going to be vice captain, <avatar_name>?\nThat's awesome!
But even if you're vice captain, no need to get\nworked up. Just keep up the good work!
Tak!


Hey, <avatar_name>. Do you remember the promise\nwe made with everyone from Hanawa MS after the\nJunior Hero League?
Of course!
What was it again?
We'd show the world the acrobatic soccer that\nwas ours and ours alone.
C'mon now, the boys would cry if they heard you\nsay that.
We were gonna show the world the acrobatic soccer\nthat was ours and ours alone, remember?
Well, these finals are gonna be broadcast all over\nthe world. And everyone's eyes are gonna be on us.
Which means it's time to fulfill that promise in\nthe coolest possible way!
Let's score a goal with our three-man combination!
Let's show the world who we are!

We did it, guys!
See that, everyone? This is our soccer!
Can you hear us, Hanawa? We did it!
The three Tachibana brothers!
I bet they're going crazy right now!
It doesn't even sound like a joke anymore!
Alright, you guys!
I can't believe you pulled off a three-person\ncombo at such a big tournament! The finals even!
The Tachibana brothers go without saying,\nbut you've improved so much since the league,\n<avatar_name>!
And to master a new move like that...\nThere's nothing you three can't do!
Woo! Masao! Kazuo! <avatar_name>! It's so cool\nthat you pulled that shot off in the finals!
Wow! You guys are so imaginative!
But the match isn't over yet, you two.\nLet's stay focused!
You know it! We're just getting started!
We did it, guys!

Masao! Kazuo! <avatar_name>! That was incredible...\nYou guys are so imaginative!
But that doesn't mean I'll let you score again!
Wow! You guys sure have some colorful\nimaginations!
But that doesn't mean I'll let you score again!

You know it! We're just getting started!

We did it, <avatar_name>!
Knew we could count on you, partner!










You're the world's top scorer...?\nThat's amazing, <avatar_name>!
All thanks to our incredible mentoring!






<avatar_name>, Masao, and Kazuo!\nCome with me. I'd like a word with you three.
Y-Yessir!
I wonder what this is all about.





Wait, so you mean...?!
Don't tell me it's the same team Tsubasa's\njoining?!



Wha?


Wha?


Wha?
That's amazing! You're being\nscouted by other countries!




Hanawa's really gonna hurt without you though.
Still, you can't turn down a chance like this!\nWe'll be cheering for ya!
That's for sure. I bet your parents will be\nsurprised when they hear this.
Yeah, it's a big decision.\nYou gotta talk it out with your family first.


Sorry for taking you away from the party,\nyou three.

If that's it, we'll be heading back.

So you're finally leaving, <avatar_name>.
I wish you could stay and help out the team next\nyear, but I'm not gonna get in the way of your\ndreams! Good luck!
I can't believe you're going overseas\nto join a foreign soccer club.
I know I wouldn't've believed it if you'd\ntold me this was gonna happen last summer.
I'd be worried going overseas at your age.\nYou gonna be okay on your own?
He'll be fine! Have you even seen this daredevil\nin action?
By the way, I heard Tsubasa\nalready left for Brazil.
I bet you wanted to be on the same plane as him.
That's rough. You had so many things\nto take care of before you could leave.
Speaking of America, how are you going to get by\nthere? How's your English?
You'll be fine, <avatar_name>!
We saw you studying like crazy when we were all\nprepping for exams.
If only you still had that translator device.\nWhen are they gonna release that for sale?
They said it was still experimental, didn't they?
I wish I had a chance to try it out.\nThat's, like, sci-fi technology.
So I heard back in Germany, Wakabayashi and\nSchneider are already playing for top teams.
You'd better work hard to join one too then,\n<avatar_name>!
Can't wait to watch your debut match!
I read in a magazine that you travel\na lot in the Brazilian soccer scene.
Be sure to take care of yourself!
You'll be playing in Brazil with Tsubasa. You'd\nbetter work and beat him to the number one spot!
Can't wait to see it!
<avatar_name>.
No matter where you go, even the other side of\nthe world, you'll always be our partner.
Let's be teammates again someday,\nand wow the world with our combo plays.
Hey there. I see the Hanawa crowd has assembled.
Mr. Katagiri!
What brings you here today?




As I recall, you two will be attending\nAkita Commercial High?
Racja!
We already passed the exam!
It would've been SUPER embarrassing if either of\nus failed.
Sometimes being twins is such a pain.
The power of your imagination will push the\nnation's soccer players to new heights.\nGood luck, you two.
Thank you!


So this is the last day we'll come to Hanawa, huh?
This whole graduation thing hasn't really sunk in\nyet.
I feel like tomorrow morning\nI'll be sprinting over here screaming "I'm late!"
Ha ha ha, I can see that.
What's that noise?
Whoa... That was awesome! <avatar_name>!
Since when could you kick off the goalposts like\nthat?
Heeey! <avatar_name>! Over here!
You sure are a hard worker.\nThat jump was practically the same as mine.
Yeah, you could definitely pull off the\nTriangle Shot with that.
But doesn't everyone already know the counter to\nthat?
<avatar_name>'s already thought that through.\nHe told me about it before.
If the opponent doesn't try to stop it,\nthen great, go for the Triangle Shot.
But if they do try, and head towards the goal\npost, that creates an opening in front of the\ngoal.
Oh, I see... So you can use it as a feint.
Good to see you're still thinking about this\nstuff!
You keep shining, and you're going to attract\nmore players here!
Just like how you joined because you admired\nMasao and Kazuo.
And when that happens, make 'em your partner and\ncome up with a new combo move that'll blow us\naway!

Mr. Katagiri!
What brings you here?
We're holding a meeting on this year's\nAkita Regionals. And since I was in the area,\nI thought I'd drop by.
Even though it's still so cold out?
Must be rough working for the Soccer Association.

I guess this year's All Japan MS Soccer\ntournament will be all about <avatar_name>,\nSawada, Nitta, and Sano...
Make sure you don't fall behind!
And you, Masao and Kazuo.\nKeep working hard in high school.
Racja!
We're not going to let <avatar_name> have all the\nglory!
Good.
The power of your imagination will push the\nnation's soccer players to new heights.\nGood luck, you two.


You didn't get any play time, <avatar_name>.
There wasn't much the team or I could do. They\noutclassed us. They even outmatched me for power.
Why'd the coach bench me?
We'd have lost even had I played.
But you did your best, right?
I wanted to be in there scrappin'!
That's a bit much, even for you, <avatar_name>.
I totally get how ya feel, but...
The coach decided you had no place in this match.\nIf you wanna be angry at anyone, you should take\na good look in the mirror.
Remember this feeling. This anger.\nUse it to drive yourself.
I'd not expected you to wallow in self-pity,\n<avatar_name>.
You'll become a pro bench warmer if ya don't want\nto win hard enough.
I did. But my everything wasn't enough.\nAnd that hurts somethin' fierce.
I never expected giants from the rest of the world\nto loom so large.
That's the spirit.
Take your frustration at being benched,\nand let it drive you.\nYou'll be back on the pitch soon enough.
Well, folks, it's time for the second half.
Germany has benched Schneider and Heine.\nThey must be feeling mighty comfortable after\nrunning up a four-point lead in the first half!
Meanwhile, Japan sits on its goose egg. They need\nto score if they're going to gain any momentum!
Wow! Schester smashes the ball\nthrough Japan's defense for a goal!
Only ten minutes into the second half, the\nMargus-Schester duo has already put\nup two more points for Germany!
That puts Germany ahead a whopping six to nil!
I can't... I just can't do it!
We're toast...
What's the point if we're gonna lose like this?
And that was our best too...
(That's it. We've lost.)
(Tsubasa... How could we fall so far?)
(We put everything we had into battling it out\nwith you at Nationals. The best of us got to\nrepresent Japan.)
(But look at us now. This\n"All-Japan Junior Youth" is a sham.\nOut in the real world we're nothing...)
(We're just bumbling all over the\nplace while the world watches!)
(We can't even fight back...)
COACH! Put me in! If things keep\ngoing like this the team is done for!
Please, Coach! If we can't at least give\n'em a bloody nose the team's not gonna\nbe able to live with themselves!
You're probably right.
But Tsubasa, you've gotta\nwatch yourself. Don't push it.
Roger that, Coach!
Coach, maybe put Matsuyama on\ndefense if Tsubasa's going to midfield.
Why him?
He's tough as nails, and he keeps everyone fired\nup. Having a general lead the defenders can make a\nbig difference against opponents like these.
Hmmm... It's a bold move, but he does have a\ntalent for defense. Let's give it a go.
Thank you, Coach.
One more thing...
I'm bringing you on too,\n<avatar_name>.
It might seem like overwhelming odds, but this is\nthe kind of battle you have to expect when it's\ntwo great nations squaring off.
<avatar_name>,\nlet's go turn the tide!
You can count on me!
D-Do you think we can really do it?
Full speed ahead!
Yeah, that's the spirit!
Let's go get 'em!
You're an All-Japan player because you've\ngot the right stuff. Believe in yourself!
Now let's get to it!
No doubt, that's what it's gonna take.
Now let's go push ourselves to our limits!
What's this? Japan subs out Sawada for...
Tsubasa! Despite his injury in an earlier\ngame, Tsubasa is joining his team on\nthe field for the second half!
And folks, it looks like here\ncomes a new challenger!
Joining the fight now is the new first-year\neveryone has their eyes on, <avatar_name>!
Chin up, everyone!
Tsubasa...
Germany is strong. No doubt about it.
But we're not going down without a fight!\nLet's hit 'em with a couple of goals and show 'em\nthat we're not about to back down!
That's right. Forget the score, let's just\ngive 'em everything we've got all the\nway to the final whistle!
Matsuyama, Coach wanted me to tell ya...
...
I'm... on defense?
Okay! I'm on it!
Hyuga.
Tsubasa...
You remember how we used to play when we came up\nagainst each other? I don't see that spark here.\nFind that fire, and let's toast Germany!
...
You're Japan's ace striker, Hyuga.\nYou've got this.
Tsubasa, you devil...
(He's right... I AM the striker, and I'm NOT\nletting this game end like this!)
So it's time for your debut on the\ninternational field, <avatar_name>.
Germany's a powerhouse,\nbut that just makes me wanna win more.
Let's show 'em what we got, <avatar_name>!
Japan's #10... Tsubasa Ozora...
That must be the guy Wakabayashi\nwas always talking about.
Huh.
Lookin' at 'im, he does have\na certain presence about him.
Oh, hey there, <avatar_name>.
I know Hirado said we'd practice tonight,\nbut we hafta cancel. Sorry!
Jito and I didn't do so well on our last exam,\nand we they're making us retake it.
Books really ain't my thing.\nI don't get what they're makin' a fuss over.
Think of it this way, Jito. Studying is another\ntough opponent you need to beat.
I guess so?
Alright then! Come on, let's go!
There you have it.\nWe'll have to practice some other time!
Oh, hey there <avatar_name>.\nYou're not doing anything?
Why don't we practice together!
My foot's not 100%, so I gotta take it a little\neasy, though.
But practice makes perfect, and that makes me want\nto practice all the time.
You've seen all our games so far, right? How do\nyou think we stack up against the other teams?
Eh, they're not so great.
Those international teams\nare insane.
What do you think, Tsubasa?
Now, that's some confidence.
You think so too, huh?
Me?
If I'm being honest, I think I can hold my own\nagainst them.
But as captain of the team, I've still got work to\ndo.
I mean, we put everything we had into the past two\ngames and still lost.
It's painfully obvious that the team needs to\nimprove if we're to come out ahead.
But the world is truly vast.
It's only been a few days since we got here, and\nwe've met one amazing player after another,\nincluding Schneider.
Being able to play against such skilled players...\nI couldn't be happier.
Huh? Who could it be?
Tsubasa!
Oh, hey guys.
What are you doing out here this late?
Do you need to ask? We're here to practice.
Judging from the past two matches, I'm sure they've\ngot more surprises in store for us, so I'm\nfocusing on my sprints.
I was jogging. I've more or less shaken off the\nfatigue from the Junior Hero League.
So I figured if I want to ramp up my training,\nit's about time I got my head in the game.
I wanna try strengthening up my legs and bring\nmore power to my Tiger Shot.
I'm gonna train using this heavy ball Coach Kira\nsent me.
You're all hyped up to train.
You're here for the same reason, right?
If we want to win, practice is the only road I\nsee.
Ain't that right, Tsubasa?
Yeah.
We all want the same thing...
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
I mean we're talking about us,\nright? I know we can do it.
No doubt!
Ummm... Could I join the circle too?
!
!
It's you!
It can't be...!
Been awhile, Tsubasa.\nAnd everyone else too, of course.
I knew you'd come, Misaki!
It's Misaki!
Yo.
I've been waiting to see you for so long!
Sorry for not being able to\nstay in touch, Tsubasa.
It doesn't matter!\nAll that matters is that you're here, now!
So when'd you arrive in America, Misaki?
Just now. Mr. Katagiri came\nto pick me up at the airport.
Still, it's like no one's changed.\nI recognized everyone almost immediately.\nStill being "friends with the ball," right?
You haven't changed much yourself, either.
I guess so.
Hey, so if you're here, then does that mean...?
Yeah, I'm representing Japan, too.
F-For real?!
It wasn't an easy decision, but in\nthe end I couldn't pass up a chance\nto play with you guys again.
I hope I won't be in the way,\nbut I'm truly glad to be here.
Don't worry about it! I know you'll do fine!
We need to work hard and\nresurrect the Golden Duo!
Definitely. Thanks, Tsubasa.
By the way, I don't think we've met?
Oh, this is your first time meeting Misaki, isn't\nit?
Well, go on. Introduce yourself.
I'm <avatar_name>.
Your reputation precedes you.\nI'm <avatar_name>.
I'm the young soccer prodigy.
I'm Taro Misaki.\nNice to meet you, <avatar_name>.
My pleasure. I'm Taro Misaki.\nNice to meet you, <avatar_name>.
Wh-What confidence...
I'm Taro Misaki.\nNice to meet you, <avatar_name>.
Alright, now let's all get back to practice!
Tak!
You too, Misaki! Let's kick the\nball around like old times!
I'd love to, but...
In order to officially join the team, the Japan\nSoccer Association has all these formalities I\nhave to deal with.
So, sorry. I can't just yet.
Oh, okay...
But once everything's taken care of, I should be\nable to join in tomorrow. See you then!
Sure! Tomorrow it is! I can't wait!
Me neither! Later!
...
(Tsubasa and Misaki led Nankatsu SC to the\nchampionship together, back in elementary school.\nAnd now they're finally together again.)
(As long as they can play like they\ndid back then... Or maybe even...)
Listen up, everyone.
After the games so far, I'm sure you realize the\nextent of the challenges you now face.
So with that in mind, this match we'll\nbe trying out a new formation.
First, Matsuyama.
Yes?
In the last match with Germany, our defensive\nplay improved after you joined the defenders.\nThat seriously helped out the whole team.
So today, I want you starting in\nthe back, leading the defenders.
Yessir!
Your midfield position will be taken over by\nMisaki. He'll be joining the starting line-up.
Huh?
I know you're new to the team, but your skills\nare the real deal. That was evident in practice.
Along with Tsubasa's support, you can turn\nit into a midfield game. I don't think there's\nanyone better suited to that task than you.
Y-Yessir! I'll do my best!
Don't worry, you'll do fine!
Yeah, let's do this, Tsubasa!
And finally...
I'm putting <avatar_name>\nin the starting line-up.
Yes, Coach! I won't let you down!
Me? In the starting line-up?!
Finally! Now's my time to shine!
Good. Try to experiment and\nfind what you're best at.
Yes, you. You were chosen to represent\nJapan, so show some confidence. And make\nsure not to forget it when you hit the field.
Well, at least I don't have to\nworry about you being timid.
Give it all you've got!
Today's opponents are from Uruguay, a\nSouth American country. They're a team\nwith speed and technique to spare.
But don't let that bother you. Winners overcome.
Don't let them set the pace.\nFind your own rhythm! Got it?
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
(This'll be my first match against a team from\nSouth America. I've been dreaming of going there\nfor what feels like forever.)
(Will my own South American-style\nplay even work against them?)
(If it does, then it should work in Brazil too...)
You're startin' today, <avatar_name>!\nSeems you're up to snuff.
This is your big chance.\nProve first string was meant for you!
Listen up, everyone.
Now that you've come this far, I imagine you all\nhave some idea of what you're truly up against.
So with that in mind, this match we'll\nbe trying out a new formation.
First up, Matsuyama.
Yes, Sir.
In the last match with Germany, our defensive\nplay improved after you joined the defenders.\nThat seriously helped out the whole team.
So today, I want you starting in\nthe back, leading the defenders.
Got it!
Your midfield position will be taken over by\nMisaki. He'll be joining the starting line-up.
Huh?
I know you're new to the team, but your skills\nare the real deal. That was evident in practice.
Along with Tsubasa's support, you can turn\nit into a midfield game. I don't think there's\nanyone better suited to that task than you.
Yes, Coach! I won't let you down!
Don't worry, you'll do fine!
Yeah, let's do this, Tsubasa!
And finally...
I'm putting <avatar_name>\nin the starting line-up.
Yes, Coach! I'll do my best!
Me? In the starting line-up?!
Finally! Now's my time to shine!
Good. Try to experiment and\nfind what you're best at.
Yes, you. You were chosen to represent Japan,\nso show some confidence. And make sure\nnot to forget it when you hit the field.
Well, at least I don't have to\nworry about you being timid.
I'm expecting 100% out of you!
You're taking on England today, captained by\nRobson playing defender. They're going to push\nhard and fast, so look out.
That means they're gonna play a lot like Italy.\nWho we came up against first.
You're gonna get a close look at the\nEuropean counter today. Learn the\ntempo and prepare for the real thing!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
You're startin' today, <avatar_name>!\nSeems you're up to snuff.
This is your big chance.\nProve first string was meant for you!
<avatar_name>! Everyone's heading to practice.\nCare to join?
Absolutely!
Sometimes, I like to train alone.
Only the weak need more training.
Great! Let's go then!
I'll run some drills with the Tachibanas.
That's fine. There are some things you only\ndiscover on your own.
Off you go, then!\nIf you need my help, you know where to find me.
I'm going to practice with the Tachibanas.
What... did you just say?
You start one game and think you're unstoppable?
Just leave him be, Sano.
Jito...
You're underestimating the competition,\n<avatar_name>. You'll regret it sooner than later.
Let's go.
Y-Yeah...
<avatar_name>! Come here for a sec.
What's gotten into you?\nThis attitude about practice ain't gonna fly!
Just cuz you made first string on the\nAll Japan team doesn't mean you can ease up.\nWe're against the best in the world.
You call that the best in the world?
Sorry. I'll try to be more focused.
But I'm the best player on this team.
...
Look, I get where you're coming from.
When I kept winnin' every time I threw hands,\nI felt let down by my foes.
But a brawl and a soccer match are two different\nthings. If you haven't figured that out...\nMan, that says a lot about ya.
Good. I hope you will be.
If you get complacent, even for a second, you'll\nget walloped. You should know that by now.
Now, let's do some extra training to make up for\nyour lazy butt!
Maybe. But you won't always be.
If you don't get that...\nWell, it says a lot about you. And not good stuff.
...
(That jerk Dirk... Looking down\non me just cuz I'm short!)
What's got YOU so bent outta shape, Sano?
Oh, Jito. Listen to this...
...And he called me a shrimp!\nSeriously, I've had it up to here!
If you're mad, then ya just gotta\nshow him who's boss.
Eh?
Nothin' hurts a defender more\nthan givin' up a goal. So jus' do that.
And I was our captain back at Hirado MS,\nright? An insult to you's an insult ta me, too!\nSo go get 'im!
Jito...
I do what I can to help!
Your shame is my shame.
That's great to hear!
It's not a one-man sport.\nLet's show them "our" strength!
<avatar_name>... Thanks.
Alright! If they score on us,\nthen we need to score on them twice!
Yeah, show 'im what's what!
Grah, I still can't believe\nI lost to someone like you!
See that, Dirk? Bigger doesn't mean better!
You did it, Sano!
I knew my partner could do it!
Thanks!
That means a lot coming from you!
Your support helped me see it through.\nYou have my thanks.
Your faith in me really helped!
Nice, Sano! Jus' like I raised ya!
Thank you, Jito.
For what? A cap's always gotta\nlook out for 'is teammates.
(Sano's a real scrapper. He's jus' the guy to lead\nHirado MS when I'm gone.)
(With that spirit, he'll wreck the other teams\nat Nationals next year!)
Alright boys, let's start practice!\nFirst up is ten laps around the field!
Roger that, Coach!
Roger that, Coach!
Roger that, Coach!
Roger that, Coach!
Roger that, Coach!
Here we gooo!
Ha! You talk big, but I betcha\nyou'll be the first to wear out!
What was that?!
Long distance running is my specialty!
Like I'd lose to you!
Those two sure are energetic.
I mean, everyone's hyped up about the training.
That's for sure. I guess we\njust love getting better.
Yeah, I need to train even\nharder, if I want to be a pro!
I won't be beaten by you either,\nIshizaki!
(Training is pointless, I'll just\nput in the minimum effort.)
What's gotten into you, <avatar_name>?\nYou seem extra charged today!
We're not going to be outdone\nby a corner-cutter like you!
N-Not bad, <avatar_name>...
Y-You've got some stamina.
Actually, you look different today. Like,\nyou got a different look in your eyes.
Seriously. Did something happen? You've\nnever seemed this motivated before.
I've been thinking about my future.
I'm aiming for the World Cup!
Your future, huh?
I think that's a great attitude! Keep pushing\nyourself, and the rest of us'll try and keep up!
Now you're sounding like Tsubasa.
What's wrong with that? I'd love\nto play in the World Cup, too.
Whatever, dreams are cheap.
What?! Just watch me! I'm definitely going to now!
I'm just glad you decided to start trying.
(He seems to understand.)
Hey, what's with that pace,\n<avatar_name>? You're gonna\nbe last, you know! Where's your drive?!
Just forget about him. If we slow down to\nmatch his pace, it'll just hurt our training, too.
Y-Yeah...
But what was up with you?
(I guess that's the kind of player he is.)
(At this point, nothing I say would\nget through to him, would it?)
Jito and Takasugi really made\nthe difference today.
France seemed to have trouble\ndealing with your height.
Yeah. I don't even wanna imagine what today\nwould've been like without you two.
Ha! I'd expect nothing\nless from our Towering Duo.
Towering Duo?
That's not really...
Takasugi! Stand tall and proud!\nThere'd be no Towering Duo without you!
Is that what you guys call yourselves now?
Some people seem to be...
I see. Since you two tower over everyone...\nI guess that's clever.
They've only got one tower, so I figured using\ntwo on our side was the perfect counter-strategy.
(What tower is he... Don't tell me he was looking\nat my research notes about the Eiffel Tower Rush?)
You really are Japan's best defender!
You'd have a hard time against the\nTachibanas.
You guys have a name now? Jealous!
Ya should be! Keep those pretty words comin'.
If I'm best in Japan, I need to be best in the\nworld next! Finals is where I'll show everyone.
(<avatar_name> really knows how to work Jito up.)
(He's something else.\nHe's got more going for him than simply soccer.)
Hehe, just what I was thinking, <avatar_name>!
That's right! Our Skylab sails above all\nstructures. We go up to the stratosphere!
Bah! In that case I'll launch\nTakasugi into the air!
Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea...
How about you and me team up\nto make the "Freshman Duo," then?
Include Nitta and myself\nand we could become the "Underclassmen Quartet"!
You know... the idea is already growin' on me.
In any case, we owe a lot to the two of you.
Don' worry. The Towering Duo Defense'll\nstand strong come finals, too!
We'll see what the coach has to say first.
Man, we're here getting all hyped up\nand you just had to be the party pooper.
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
(I was only able to give it my all\nafter Jito pushed me to,\nbut I'm glad things worked out this way.)
(Hopefully this proves that\nI was able to accomplish something worthy\nas a defender for Japan.)
(Thank you, Jito.)
You've been training like you want something\nagain. It's good to have you back.
What changed your mind?
Actually...
I had a one-to-one with Coach...
I see.
You did? Spill it.
Coach!
What is it?
I heard from <avatar_name> you\nadvised him on his attitude.
Thank you! I owe ya for that.
Nah, it wasn't anything as fancy as "guidance."
He just realized what was happening\nand picked himself up on his own.
I've been in the soccer business a long time, you\nknow, and I've seen a lot of talented players.
But unfortunately, more than a few of them\nnever make anything of themselves.
And of those, most of them take their success for\ngranted and cut corners on their training, letting\ntheir talent go to waste.
<avatar_name>, your talent is an amazing thing,\nand that's precisely why I want you\nto never let up on your training.
Keep up this new attitude and become\na real hero to the sport, alright?
That goes for you too, Jito.
That goes for you too, Jito.
I'm on it! I'm bringin' everything\nand a little extra!
Right, <avatar_name>?
A fist fight can be won alone, but beating\na player on the other team won't mean a thing\nif we lose.
This team is full of members representing Japan.\nWe all want to take on the world's best players.
The second stringers are working their butts off\nbecause they're gunnin' for your spot as starter.
Their drive to be a regular on the team is fiercer\nthan any player you'll face on another team.
Let your guard down and you'll be mincemeat.\nThat's what gives a fight meaning.
Take it to heart and don't you dare slack off\nanymore!
Junior Youth World Challenge\nDay of the Finals
That morning...
Alright, that's enough for a morning warm-up.\nHow're you all feeling?
I'm at the top of my game!
I'm just a little tired.
Good to hear!\nTry to take that into the match, too.
Hey, you're even younger than me! Don't be lazy!
Ishizaki, how old are we now...?
There's something I need to tell you guys.
What's the matter, Tsubasa?
Actually, for today's match...
I want <avatar_name> to act as vice captain.
You're making him the vice captain?
Yeah.
Ever since we came to America,\nI've been watching over this team as its captain.
But <avatar_name>'s the one who really pulled\nus through. He's put in the effort both on the\nfield and in practice.
The way he's worked to pull this team together\nand move us forward can't be overstated.
Hmm...
And for all of us third years,\nthis really is our final match.
For the next two years, I'm sure he'll take\nthe reins to lead middle school soccer.
And he'll need this sort of experience. It's\nimportant he gets it in such an important match.
What d'you all think?
Sounds good to me! <avatar_name>'s got the drive.
If you think it's fine, then why not?
Well, if it's <avatar_name>,\nthen I guess it's fine.
Sure, why not?
I approve.
I think it's a good idea, too!
Me too.
Coach...
So no objections to <avatar_name>\nbeing the vice captain then?
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Got it.
Then I'm officially appointing <avatar_name>\nas vice captain for the finals.
Now, go give a speech.
No need to be so nervous.\nJust play like you always do!
Hah, that's good to hear!\nYou carry our dreams with you, Vice Captain!
You know it! I can already see our victory parade!
You're going to be vice captain, <avatar_name>?\nThat's awesome!
Just don't let it get to your head.\nKeep doin' what you've been doin'.
Alright!\nThen we're counting on you, <avatar_name>!
Time to take on the world!
Just a little more... We're almost there!
I-I've been fine up 'til now, but\nsuddenly I'm a ball of nerves!
We have to keep this lead in the second half...
That's a dangerous train of thought, Ishizaki.
What?
Tsubasa's right. Germany's gonna play this\nsecond half as if their lives depend on it.
If we focus only on defense, there's a chance we\nmight be crushed.
Right. We have to keep pushing, keep scoring.
Ah, I get it.
Right, let's start this half on the offensive!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Let's tighten up our defense.
No time to be passive. Go on the attack!
So you're saying this is going\nto be a true test for our defenders!
Tak! Shore up our walls and keep 'em out!
If we need a stronger defense, then I'm your guy!
I reckon maybe we could use the same strat\nas when I was at Hirado, yeah?
Okay folks, listen up.
Germany's gonna come at us guns blazing.\nWe can't just sit and wait for them.
The best defense is a good offense, right?
Well then, how about the strategy we used at\nAzumaichi? It's perfect for times like this!
Here's what we do.
I see... That's a nice, logical plan.
Yeah, that sounds good. Okay then,\nthat's our strategy for the second half.
Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
We're so close to being number one in the world.
With the lead,\nall we have to do now is maintain it.
That's a dangerous line of thinking.
What?
Hyuga's right. This isn't your average team. It's\nBrazil. They're called the kingdom of soccer for\na reason, and they're not going to lie down.
If we only stick to defense, they'll entangle us\nin their pace and rhythm in no time.
If Brazil wants to go on the offensive, then our\nbest defense is a good offense! Tit for tat.
Okay, I got you!
Right, let's start this half on the offensive!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
The best offense is a good defense!
The best defense is a good offense!
So you're saying this is going\nto be a true test for our defenders!
Tak! Shore up our walls and keep 'em out!
If we need a stronger defense, then I'm your guy!
I reckon maybe we could use the same strat\nas when I was at Hirado, yeah?
Okay folks, listen up.
Brazil's hungry for the win, and they'll come\nclaws at the ready. But we can't fall into the\ntrap of playing passively.

Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Just a little more... We're almost there!
We just need to protect our lead!
I think it's too early to be turtling up.
Why?
Takasugi is right. Based on how America was\nplaying in the first half, they were saving\ntheir energy to take us down in the second.
Right. That's the same tactic\nNankatsu used during overtime in\nthe elementary school tournament.
That's when Tsubasa and Misaki sat on the bench\nfor the first half, and went full throttle\nin the second.
Meaning for our current situation...
America is ready to unleash a punishing assault\nif we stick to defense.
The best defense against such an\naggressive offense is our own offense!
Definitely. Trust me, they'll really hate that.
We've got to stay on the offensive\nin the second half, as well!
You got it!
Let's play it safe!
We should widen our lead!
So you're saying this is going\nto be a true test for our defenders!
Tak! Shore up our walls and keep 'em out!
If we need a stronger defense, then I'm your guy!
I reckon maybe we could use the same strat\nas when I was at Hirado, yeah?

Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Yes, Coach!
(His movements are unusually adept.\nHe's gained more than skill here...\nHe's found confidence, too.)
(Come to think of it, maybe he's the one\nwho's carried the team this far.)
(Either way, seeing him grow into one of the\npillars of the team does my heart proud.)
Nice one, <avatar_name>!\nA goal in the finals is huge!
It's too early to celebrate.
I'm dying to score another already!
I hope the Hirado guys are watching...
Well aren't you too cool for school.
But you're right.\nCan't be counting unhatched chickens.
Had a feeling you'd say something like that.
Now that it's been said, time to get to doin'.
What?! Of course, they are!
That <avatar_name> really did it!
Scoring in the world championship game is nothing\nshort of amazing.
He's just warmin' up, though.
No kidding. He won't be happy without a second\nand even third goal.
I bet you've got an ace up your sleeve yet.\nI know you better than anyone.
Let's keep the momentum and keep on scorin'!
(Magnificent, <avatar_name>.\nYou've long since surpassed my expectations.)
(I'm proud of you, boy.)
(But I'm sure you're not done wreaking havoc yet!\nMake full use of the time left!)
<avatar_name>! You are really amazing.
A hat trick in a match like this?!\nI'd never have bet on that!
It's thanks to your training, Jito!
Strong opponents make me try harder.
I'll claim the title of Hirado's ace.
Happy to hear it.
I'm not gonna lose to ya. You wait and see, bud.\nI'm the man who makes the winning happen!
Makes sense.
So the tougher they are, the more you're driven.\nI'm glad you're on my team, instead of the other\nway around.
Yeah, boys! We keep this fire ragin',\nand it's in the bag!
Even Sano would agree.
But that's next year.\nLet's focus on the match at hand!
You may be behind on the scoreboard right now,\nbut your soccer is just as good as theirs!
Plus, I can tell you for sure that the audience\ncan tell how much fun you're having out there!
I mean, even people in the American seats\nare cheering for you guys!
Just have faith that you're playing soccer right,\nand you'll pull it off!
Now go give it everything you've got\nin the remaining time!
Yes, Coach!
Finally, just one more half to go.
And then it's goodbye, Tsubasa.
I guess so, Misaki...
I know I said the same thing three\nyears ago, but let's end this with a win.
Tak!
You seem to have caught Ryan's attention,\n<avatar_name>.
With him goin' for ya like that,\nhe must think of you as a rival.
He's the one guy I can't lose to!
He's no big deal.
He's probably thinking the same thing.
You don't really think that.
You can't hide it. He's a big deal,\nno matter how you slice it.
Havin' a rival is a great thing, ya know.
I don't think you need me tellin' ya, but the need\nto beat a rival will push you to new heights.
That's something we learned in the\nJunior Hero League.
Iron sharpens iron. You and Ryan become better\nplayers by competing against each other.
We're not taking that beat down lying down!\nLet's return the favor in the second half!
If you outdo Ryan, it'll lead to the team winnin'!\nPlay as if your life depended on it!
The man who burst onto the scene like a comet,\n<avatar_name>!
Ya did it, <avatar_name>!
That's my partner for you!
Congrats on earning MVP. Even\nI was following your lead this time.
Let's aim for the World Cup together!
Yeah, let's both do our best!
For the World Cup!
Tak! There's still much to be achieved!
Tak! It'll take all our dedication\nto make that dream a reality.
And not only that, <avatar_name>\nwas also the top scorer!
He could easily be called the hero of\nthe Junior Youth World Challenge!
Our sincerest congratulations!
The man who burst onto the scene like a comet,\n<avatar_name>!
You're the top scorer in the world! What a dude!
As a forward on the school team, I'm jealous.\nBut hey, congrats, <avatar_name>!
Congrats, <avatar_name>!\nI've got a lot to learn from you!
Let's aim for the World Cup together!
I'll lead Japan forward!
We'll definitely win it!
I'm not falling behind either!\nI'll see you on the pitch!
Yeah, no question! We can do it!
We're home!
No, we're not!
Oh, right! Oops. It just slipped out.
I know the feeling.
We've been here so long, and done so\nmuch... It really does feel a little like home.
But tomorrow, we're headed back to Japan.
Yeah, tomorrow's already the day...
After having so much fun together for so long,\nit'll be lonely when we have to go our separate\nways again.
But I know we'll see each other again,\nas long as we stay in the game.
Absolutely.
All the more reason to live\nit up at tonight's party!
Time to pig out!
We should try not to eat too much.
Don't forget we have to study.
You know it! I'm gonna eat and eat until I burst!
Someone's excited...
Haha! Don't worry, you're young!\nYou're still growing, so dig in!
Don't be such a wet blanket! We're young\nathletes-- We're in our eating prime!
I'm fairly certain, you won't get\ntaller just because you eat more...
Ya just gotta ruin everything.
You're still thinking of studying\nat a time like this?
I'm sure the school won't mind\nus taking one night off.
If you're really worried though, you\ncan always study on the flight home.
Then let's get this party started!
<avatar_name>, Jito. Come with me.\nI'd like a word with you two.
O-Okay.
What is it?
Sorry for bothering you right before the party.
Actually, this is about\n<avatar_name>.
I was just contacted by a Brazilian soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
And that team happens to be\ncoached by Roberto Hongo.
What?! Isn't that the team Tsubasa's joining?
Exactly.
I was just contacted by Mr. Cardinal.
It seems you've been scouted\nfor an American soccer club.
Wow.
I was just contacted by a German soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
Wow.
I was just contacted by a Brazilian soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
Wow.
You really are something else,\ngettin' scouted by someone overseas.
Anyway, I'd like to give a reply as soon\nas possible, but what do you think?
Please, tell them we're interested!
Can I talk to my family first?
Understood. I'll let them know.
That does leave a gaping hole in Hirado's lineup,\nthough.
But forget that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime\nchance! I back your play all the way!
You'll need all the support ya can get.\nJust wait til your parents catch wind.
Of course, the other party is aware of that,\ntoo, and they'll discuss it with your family.\nWe can save the details for later.
I'll let them know, though.
Sorry for taking you away from the party, you two.
Go enjoy yourselves. I'll join you later.
Then, we'll be heading back!
(Both Tsubasa and <avatar_name>\nwill lead us to the future of Japanese soccer!)
So, the day has finally come for you to hit the\nroad and see the world, <avatar_name>.
I'd be lying if I said the team doesn't need ya.\nBut you've gotta follow your dreams, ya know.
I know you won't, but for good measure,\ndon't you go gettin' soft.
I can't believe you're going overseas\nto join a foreign soccer club.
I know I wouldn't have believed it if you'd\ntold me this was gonna happen last summer.
I'd be worried going traveling abroad at your age.\nYou gonna be okay on your own?
He'll be fine. He's tough, and he ain't dumb.
By the way, I heard Tsubasa already left for\nBrazil.
I bet you wanted to be on the same plane as him.
Oh well. You had so many things to take care of\nbefore you could leave.
So, you're headed to America...\nHow's your English, <avatar_name>?
He should be fine. We've gone to the same\nEnglish conversation school for a while now,\nand he's put a lot of effort into it.
Well, isn't that something.\nI guess you're all ready, then!
On the topic of Germany, Wakabayashi,\nSchneider, and the rest are already playing\nin matches with top tier teams, right?
You've got a lot of work ahead\nof you if you want to catch up!
I'm looking forward to seeing you play!
I read in a magazine that you travel a lot in the\nBrazilian soccer scene. Be sure to take care of\nyourself!
I know for a fact you'll be working to surpass\nTsubasa.
I hope you do, someday!
I can't believe you're really going.\nI wanted to win Nationals with you.
No, this won't do. I can't be this way on the day\nyou head out.
Follow your dreams and stay dedicated to achieving\nthem. I'll be working hard on this end to win\nNationals!
Hey there. I see the Hirado crew is here.
Mr. Katagiri?! What're you doin' here?
I came to see <avatar_name>\noff, of course!
<avatar_name>,\nyou're in for some stiff competition.
Support staff are constantly monitoring players,\nand only the ones they judge the best of the best\nget on the roster. It's harsh.
You will be pushed to your very limits,\nbut I believe you will make it through.\nWork hard and have faith in your talents.
Jito, you and your crew are headed to the\nKunimi Institute if I'm not mistaken.
That's right! We made it in!
Allow me to congratulate all of you.
Never give up. That goes for both soccer\nand perhaps school, as well.
Everyone in Japan could learn a thing or two\nby watching you guys "fight" in each match.
Thanks!
Sano. You, Nitta, and Sawada will be the stars of\nmiddle school soccer.
I look forward to more intense\nbattles like you fought last year.
Yes, sir! We won't let our rivals beat us, and\nwe'll be taking the trophy home from Nationals.
See you around, <avatar_name>.
Hopefully, at the Youth Championship.
Hirado MS Soccer Club, Third Year Graduation Match\nThird Years vs. Second Years
Come on, <avatar_name>!
Don't fall for that trick! Hatakeyama, be careful!
Got it!
Here I go...
Psyche!
What?!
Heh heh. We did it!
No way. I didn't expected him to just let\n<avatar_name>'s shot go by like that.
It's just another combo we like to bust out!
We did it!
Not only did he change the trajectory,\nbut he got it so close to the goal post!
Changing the trajectory wasn't enough.\nI had to evolve it into a new combo.
Don't fall for that trick! Hatakeyama, be careful!
Got it!
Here I go...
And after a juke...!
What?!
You fell for it, Jito!
Ha!
Unbelievable...
Our combo shots are one thing, but our ability\nto adapt to situations serves us well, too.
I can't believe it...
How did we third years lose?
We did it! We beat the third years!
Tak!
I know we took some time off to study for exams,\nbut to think the first and second years upped\ntheir game this much that fast...
This is our graduation match.\nI feel like we've just been thanked in a way.
It'd be rude of us to not try our best.\nRight, <avatar_name>?
...
You look happy, despite the loss, Jito.
I was thinkin' how tough everyone's gotten.
With this team, Nationals is in the bag.\nI'm sure of it.
I'm looking forward to this summer!
Could I trouble you for a moment?
Mr. Katagiri!
What're you doin' here?
We're holding a meeting on this year's\nNagasaki Regionals. And since I was\nin the area, I thought I'd drop by.
Oh? Matsuyama sent me a message saying he met you\nyesterday.
So you were in Hokkaido yesterday and in Nagasaki\ntoday? Man you've got a tough job.
I'll go anywhere I'm needed,\nif it will advance Japanese soccer.
I guess this year's All Japan MS Soccer\ntournament will be all about <avatar_name>,\nSano, Sawada, and Nitta...
Make sure you don't get left behind!
Yes, sir! My combo plays with <avatar_name>\nare unbeatable!
I hope to see them in the upcoming season.
Jito, you and your crew are headed to the\nKunimi Institute if I'm not mistaken.
Yep! Taking time to study while we were in America\nhas really paid off!
Everyone in Japan could learn a thing or two\nby watching you guys "fight" in each match.
Thanks!
If you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way.
Let's meet again at another youth tournament!
Too bad you didn't get a chance to\nplay today, <avatar_name>.
Before the match, I sad I'd return to Japan with\nno losses, but I stumbled at the first hurdle.
Even worse, I left the game with an injury,\nwhich meant my team had to carry me.
If only I'd been out there!
How is that injury?
Everyone did their\nbest to compensate.
It's because you play alone.
Yeah. It's important to maintain\nthat kind of self-belief.
Having confidence is why you feel frustrated,\nbut that frustration drives you to work harder.
Like I said before...
Thanks to treatment and strengthening exercises\nduring the Junior Hero League, I limped off with\nno more than a light sprain.
I'm grateful to everyone for making it\nso I could focus on recovering.
I was watching you all on TV in the infirmary\nwhile recovering. Everyone was really hauling\ntail.
And that's frustrates me the most.\nYou all were going above and beyond, but I keep\nwondering what more I could've done as a captain.
...I get what you're saying.
But if I back down from their challenges out\nthere, I won't be able to face off with the\nworld's strongest in the future.
That's just how I feel.
I'm sure everyone's frustrated about losing today.
<avatar_name>, let's take the anger we feel right\nnow, the regret of our loss, and let's turn it\ninto motivation.



























































Looks like it's finally time to strut\nyour stuff on the field.
I bet you've got some nerves jumping about right\nnow. Relish it. Make those nerves work for you.
Here we go! Let's hit Germany head on\nwith our willpower and might!




Hey, <avatar_name>! About practice tonight...
Sorry, but I can't make it!
Everyone's pushing me to do\nsome special study sessions.
With Ishizaki's current grades,\nhe won't be able to make it into Nankatsu HS.
That's right.\nIt's on us to make sure he does well.
Plus, we'll be studying with him,\nso we'll all do better on our next tests.
You stick to working on your game, <avatar_name>.
Come on, Ishizaki. To the study room we go.
Okay... Later, <avatar_name>.




























































































































Nice job making it into the starting lineup,\n<avatar_name>! As your senior, I'm really happy for\nyou!
This match is a gonna be a good opportunity\nfor you. Really hammer home your plays battling\nUruguay!































Nice job making it into the starting lineup,\n<avatar_name>! As your senior, I'm really happy for\nyou!
This match is a gonna be a good opportunity\nfor you. Really hammer home your plays battling\nEngland!
<avatar_name>, I'm gonna train with the team. You?
I'll go, too!
Maybe I'll practice\non my own for once.
Prodigies don't need practice.
Cool! Let's get to it!
Right on. I'm sure you'll make\ngood use of the time.
Good luck! And don't hesitate to ask\nfor help if you need it!
...You're not serious, are you?
...
Lemme just say one thing...\nTsubasa would never skip out on practice.
See ya! Suit yourself!
Hey, <avatar_name>. We need to talk.
Your attitude lately has been inexcusable.\nYou haven't even been practicing.\nWhat are you thinking?
You're not letting your recent success\nbecoming a starter go to your head, are you?
This is just my style.
Ah, I'm sorry.\nI'll work harder.
Don't be jealous of my talent.
Oh, is it?
Looks like quickly going from a Nankatsu\nregular to a rep has overinflated your ego.
Looking at soccer like that is gonna come back\nand bite you in the butt one of these days.
The rest is on you, but you should\nthink long and hard about it.
Did I get through to you?
You've got skills, you've got guts,\nand above all else, you love soccer, don't you?
Make sure you don't cheat yourself by taking it\neasy. When you do that, it's you and the team that\nmisses out.
Now, let's go practice!
Wha--?!
What's the matter with you, <avatar_name>?\nYou can't talk to Tsubasa like that!
Just drop it, Ishizaki.
Tsubasa...
Your talent is the real deal.\nI'll give you that.
But... If you keep acting this way,\nyou'll never grow beyond where you are now.
Let's go, Ishizaki.
Okay...















(Is he really gonna be all right\nif this keeps up?)
(I wonder why he's taken such\na nasty attitude toward practice.)



(I had really high hopes for him.)

Glad you're back to normal, <avatar_name>.
What was goin' on?
Actually...
Coach talked to me...
...I see. So that's what happened?
He did? Can you tell me what happened?
Coach!

I heard from <avatar_name> that you gave him\nsome guidance as to his attitude.\nWe all really appreciate that.







I think this goes without saying,\nbut it goes for you, too, Tsubasa.
Tak! I'll keep working hard!



Nice going, <avatar_name>! Scoring in the finals\nand everything. You really shine during matches!
Can't be satisfied yet!
The bigger the stage,\nthe more hype I get!
Naturally.
True. The match is still going.\nWe'll have to wait for that final whistle before\nwe bask in any glory.
Let's go get us another goal!
I'm the same.
Well, playing against the international best of\nthe best is about is big as it can get. Let's get\nthat hype train runnin' full steam ahead!
Quite self-assured, I see.
Can't let you outshine me, though.\nThat next goal is mine!



Nice one, <avatar_name>!
I gotta say, when we met, I did not expect you\nto turn into the crazy player you are today.
Nankatsu taught me a lot!
Staying driven has\npushed me this far!
I had you to look up to!
It's true Nankatsu's training really whips you\ninto shape. I'm glad it's come in handy!
Well, the match is still going.\nLet's push ourselves to be number one!
You sound like Ishizaki.
Well, the match is still going.\nI wanna see more of this drive of yours.
<avatar_name>...
I'll have to keep pushing ahead, then.
Let's make this team an international threat!











You seem to have caught Ryan's attention,\n<avatar_name>.
With him gunning for you like that,\nhe must think of you as a rival.
Well, right back at him!
I don't really\nsee him like that.
Oh, so it's mutual, then!
Ah, all right.
Well either way, you seem to be\nenjoying yourself out there.
It's good to have a rival.
The drive to beat that person makes you stronger.
And when two rivals are working to outgun each\nother, they have a reason to push themselves to\nthe limits.
That's how it is with Schneider and myself.
Now then, let's go make up for everything\nthey put you through in the first half!
You competing with and beating Ryan\nwill help the team immensely.


Morning, <avatar_name>.\nSorry to wake you up so early.
Coach was calling for you.\nSaid to go to his office.
Come in.
<avatar_name>, I know it's early, but there's\nsomething I wanted to talk to you about.
Tsubasa.
Yes.
<avatar_name>... Actually,\nI want you to be vice captain for this next match.
M-Me? Vice captain?
It's so sudden.
Yep.
There's a reason behind that. Let me explain.
Ever since we got to America, I've been\nwatching over this team as captain.
But <avatar_name>, you helped pull us through.\nYou put in the effort both in game and in practice.
The way you've worked to pull this team together\nand move us forward can't be overstated.
And for all of us third years,\nthis really is our final match.
For the next two years, I'm sure you'll take\nthe reins to lead middle school soccer.
And you'll need this sort of experience.\nIt's important you get it in such an important\nmatch.
So what do you say? Will you be our vice captain?
Got it! I'll do my best!
Am I fit for this?
You're gonna be a perfect fit for this.\nKeep up the good work!
I've been watching you since the Nankatsu MS days.\nYou'll be more than fine. Believe in yourself!
Well then, let's let the\nothers know before practice.
Right. I'll talk to them.
So I thought I'd have <avatar_name> be vice captain\nfor the finals today.
What does everyone think?





























<avatar_name> for rep vice captain? Awesome.
Everyone acknowledges your hard work and skills.\nAlso, as your seniors, we're really happy to see\nthe team will have you next year.
Don't feel like you have to stress over it,\neither.
Yeah, we've got your back!
Just give it your best shot.\nSame way you always do!
<avatar_name>! Let's do it with willpower and guts!



You did it, <avatar_name>!\nI knew you had it in you!
It's pretty incredible. Why, it wasn't that long\nago you weren't even a regular at Nankatsu!
Congrats! All that hard work paid off, huh?










Amazing, <avatar_name>!\nYou really outdid yourself this time!
But for real, to think you'd come this far...
As Scoremonger, I kinda hate to say it,\nbut congrats, <avatar_name>!






























<avatar_name> and Tsubasa!\nCome with me. I'd like a word with you two.
O-Okay.
I wonder what this is all about.





What?
So wait, the same team as me?!



What?
You're being scouted by other countries,\n<avatar_name>! That's amazing!


What?
You're being scouted by other countries,\n<avatar_name>! That's amazing!


What?
You're being scouted by Brazil, <avatar_name>!\nThat's amazing!




So you're taking on the international scene, too,\nhuh? I know it's not about me,\nbut I'm still getting excited about it!
I hear ya.
I've been talking to my folks about it since\nforever ago. They're both supportive of it,\nbut yeah.
This is all really sudden, so I'm sure your family\nwill be shocked, too. Gotta talk it out with them.


Sorry for taking you away from the party, you two.

Racja! Please, excuse us!

And time passed...\nMarch of the following year--
Why are you leaving for Brazil so suddenly,\nTsubasa?
...
The high school acceptance results\nget announced today, so no one's around.\nWe haven't even had our graduation ceremony.
Well, it's because...
What?
I've devoted everything I am to soccer up to this\npoint. And now I get to go to Brazil to fulfill a\ndream I've had since I was a little kid.
But I think it's all because I was blessed\nwith the friends and circumstances I've had.
When I go to Brazil, I won't have anyone.\nI'll have to do everything on my own.
And I don't intend to return to Japan\nuntil I've gone pro.
That's why I think I wanna leave\nJapan on my own, too.
Alone... But...
...
If I let everyone see me off then, I dunno, I\nfeel like I'll wanna hurry up and return to Japan.
Really?
It's not like I'm not sure about it.\nIt's just, I feel really uneasy.
Tsubasa...
But I'll be okay. Even when I go to Brazil,\nsoccer will still be my life.\nI know how to live that way. Don't you worry.
But as it turns out,\nI still wanted to say goodbye to you.
Thanks for coming today.\nI'll remember this moment.
Tsubasa...
I gotta go. It's almost time for the bus.
Um, if it's not going to be too much added weight,\nI want you to take this.
What is it?
Some cleats.\nI thought you might have a good use for these.
Thank you. I'll make sure they see\nsome solid time on the pitch.
Until next time!
Yep.
Tsubasa.
Chase those dreams!
Tsubasa. Finally time for you to go do what\nyou've been planning to for so long.
Yes.
You barely packed anything at all, though.
It's not like I'm going sight-seeing.\nIf I need anything, I'll buy it there.
Of course. Sorry.\nI'm not trying to inspire worry in you.
No worries.
Anyway, thanks for coming to see me off today,\nMr. Katagiri.
About that...
There's actually someone else\nwho came to say farewell.
Who?
<avatar_name>!
He entered Nankatsu and grew watching you,\nfollowing in your footsteps. And now, he's\ngoing out into the world, also just like you.
I wanted him to come and see you take off, so that\nmaybe he could see how one takes flight.
I suppose since you'll be on the same team,\nyou'll meet up over there again, but still...
He's going to America,\nso it'll be a different environment from yours.\nBut as a fellow player with the same drive...
He's going to Germany,\nso it'll be a different environment from yours.\nBut as a fellow player with the same drive...
I suppose since you're both going to Brazil,\nyou might just meet up again. Still...
<avatar_name>, we may be teammates in Brazil,\nbut we'll still be competing to become pros.
I'm going after my dream, so there's a chance\nwe might end up battling pretty fiercely.
But even if it does come to that,\nwe're still good buds. That much won't change.
<avatar_name>, as we saw in the tournament last\nyear, America's got a pretty awesome thing going\non.
That said, players from all over the world swarm\nthere looking for that very thing. I think the\nfight for survival's gonna be a tough one.
I'm sure you'll be fine, though. If we fight hard,\nI know we'll meet again on the pro scene.
<avatar_name>, I'm sure you already know this,\nbut the level of soccer in Germany is super high.
And you'll be diving right into that.\nIt's not gonna be easy, I can tell you that.
But Wakabayashi and Schneider are already\nout doing their thing as pros.\nCan't let them make us look bad, right?
<avatar_name>, our teams'll be different, but we're\nboth going to Brazil, the kingdom of soccer.
There's gonna be no shortage of players aiming\nto go pro. You can bet competition will be fierce.
Let's charge in. We gotta be determined\nand do our best to pursue our dreams!
<avatar_name>, like Tsubasa said, the place you're\ngoing has some serious competition in store for\nyou.
The staff will be constantly checking your\ncondition, and only those who they approve\nwill remain on the team. It's a cutthroat world.
There will be times when you may lose hope...\nBut you'll have to push through that. I believe\nyou can, and you need to believe it, too.
Tsubasa, from now on, Japanese soccer will be\nriding on your shoulders. I'm counting on you.
...
That's not quite right.
What?
From now on, Japanese soccer will be\nriding on <avatar_name>'s shoulders,\nalong with Misaki, Wakabayashi, and Hyuga...
Every player in the country\nwho fought so hard last summer!
Yeah... You're absolutely right.
Tsubasa and <avatar_name> set the bar for the rest\nof the players in the country to strive toward.
Your success will pave the way for the success\nof Japanese soccer in the future. Good luck.
Tak!
And as the winners of the Junior Youth tournament,\nour next goal will be dominating the\nYouth tournament.
I'll be looking forward to that!
Days later--
Yo. How goes?!
Congrats on becoming the new captain,\n<avatar_name>.
Even though you don't have the same number of\nyears, you're the only one who can lead the team.
Counting on you for Nankatsu's fourth--\nno, fifth championship!
Right, leave it to me!
Congrats on high school\nenrollment!
That's the stuff!\nI knew you were the man for the job.
Thanks, man!
I mean, I was waitlisted at first, but hey,\nI made it in eventually so, huzzah!
Willpower and drive work for studying, too,\nyou know! Keep it up!
Anyway, I'm glad everyone managed\nto get into Nankatsu HS.
I knew Ishizaki would, but man, even Misaki?
I was surprised when my dad said\nhe was coming back to Japan.
He went to France to develop his talent as a\npainter, so he could paint his perfect vision\nof Mt. Fuji.
Last year, when he saw me playing as a\nrepresentative for Japan, he said it made\nhim want to do the same for his vision.
If we count Misaki, Nankatsu HS's soccer club is\nlooking good. We gotta fight to be the number one\nJapanese high school soccer team!
Tak!
Though I will miss having Tsubasa around.
For real. Can't believe he left\nwithout even going to graduation.
Did he really have to leave without telling us?
I think I know what he was feeling.
Misaki.
The fact that he left without telling us means\nhe sees us as a special group of friends.
Huh?
We're close, so if he took time to say goodbye\nto us, it'd only make it harder for him to go.
Ah, I see. He needs all his resolve where he's\nheaded if he's going to make it to becoming pro.
Maybe he felt like us seeing him off would make\nhim hesitant to jump into such an extreme\nsituation.
Yeah, that's gotta be it. I've had to say goodbye\nto a lot of friends, so I know how that feels.
Heading off into a foreign country all on your\nown... I guess that's enough to even make Tsubasa\nuneasy.
Hey, come on, you guys. Stop looking so glum!
Ishizaki.
If Tsubasa's going as far as the other side of the\nworld for the sake of his dreams, the least we can\ndo is cheer him on!
After all, our bonds of friendship will last!
Trying to act cool, huh?
Seriously!
But, you know what? Ishizaki's right.
Yeah, his dream is our dream, too.
Tsubasa's determined to go to the ends of the\nEarth...
We need to fight for our goals, too!\nCan't let him be the only one!
Tak!
Pardon my intrusion.
Mr. Katagiri?! What are you doing here?
I have a message for you from Tsubasa.
He sent us a message?
Yes. I went to see him off the other day\nwhen he left for Brazil.
Tsubasa, from now on, Japanese soccer will be\nriding on your shoulders. I'm counting on you.
...
That's not quite right.
What?
From now on, Japanese soccer will be riding on\nthe shoulders of every player in the country who\ncompeted together last summer!
He said that?
Starting this year, you guys are going to be\nat the center of high school soccer.
Nankatsu and Toho Academy, just like\nwhen you competed in middle school.
Your rivalry with Hyuga and Wakashimazu is\ngonna raise the level for all of Japan.\nI'm counting on you.
Tak!
All right! We can't be outdone by Tsubasa.\nLet's make this our mission!
And <avatar_name>, you guys'll be at the center\nof the National MS tournament this year.
But your rivals are growing stronger every day.
Nitta, Sano, and Sawada are just some of the many\nplayers who'll be challenging you with the goal of\nbeating Nankatsu.
The level of middle school soccer will rise as you\ncontinue to develop. I'm looking forward to it.


Looks like neither of us saw any playtime today.
I don't think I need to tell you what happened.\nIt was our first match representing Japan,\nbut boy was it humiliating.
That's what the coach gets\nfor not letting us play!
I doubt we would've\nmade a difference.
Everyone did their best.
Seems coach thinks\nwe're benchwarmers.
I hate losing as much as you do.
But that's one thing you should never say.\nDon't even think it.
Whatever it is you're feeling,\nlet it drive you to be a better player.
I don't ever wanna hear you\nspout such nonsense again.
You'll be warming that bench to the end of days,\nunless you start to value your presence on the\npitch.
If that's the best we could do,\nthen it means we just weren't good enough.
I can't believe we were so massively outclassed.
I hate this as much as you do, believe me.
But if the coach thought we could contribute,\nwe'd be in there. Apparently, we didn't cut\nthe mustard.
Don't forget this feeling. It's what'll\ndrive you to becoming a better player.
Well, folks, it's time for the second half.
Germany has benched Schneider and Heine.\nThey must be feeling mighty comfortable after\nrunning up a four-point lead in the first half!
Meanwhile, Japan sits on its goose egg. They need\nto score if they're going to gain any momentum!
Wow! Schester smashes the ball\nthrough Japan's defense for a goal!
Only ten minutes into the second half, the\nMargus-Schester duo has already put\nup two more points for Germany!
That puts Germany ahead a whopping six to nil!
I can't... I just can't do it!
We're toast...
What's the point if we're gonna lose like this?
And that was our best too...
(That's it. We've lost.)
(Tsubasa... How could we fall so far?)
(We put everything we had into battling it out\nwith you at Nationals. The best of us got to\nrepresent Japan.)
(But look at us now. This\n"All-Japan Junior Youth" is a sham.\nOut in the real world we're nothing...)
(We're just bumbling all over the\nplace while the world watches!)
(We can't even fight back...)
COACH! Put me in! If things keep\ngoing like this the team is done for!
Please, Coach! If we can't at least give\n'em a bloody nose the team's not gonna\nbe able to live with themselves!
You're probably right.
But Tsubasa, you've gotta\nwatch yourself. Don't push it.
Roger that, Coach!
Coach, maybe put Matsuyama on\ndefense if Tsubasa's going to midfield.
Why him?
He's tough as nails, and he keeps everyone fired\nup. Having a general lead the defenders can make a\nbig difference against opponents like these.
Hmmm... It's a bold move, but he does have a\ntalent for defense. Let's give it a go.
Thank you, Coach.
One more thing...
I'm bringing you on too,\n<avatar_name>.
It might seem like overwhelming odds, but this is\nthe kind of battle you have to expect when it's\ntwo great nations squaring off.
<avatar_name>,\nlet's go turn the tide!
You can count on me!
D-Do you think we can really do it?
Full speed ahead!
Yeah, that's the spirit!
Let's go get 'em!
You're an All-Japan player because you've\ngot the right stuff. Believe in yourself!
Now let's get to it!
No doubt, that's what it's gonna take.
Now let's go push ourselves to our limits!
What's this? Japan subs out Sawada for...
Tsubasa! Despite his injury in an earlier\ngame, Tsubasa is joining his team on\nthe field for the second half!
And folks, it looks like here\ncomes a new challenger!
Joining the fight now is the new first-year\neveryone has their eyes on, <avatar_name>!
Chin up, everyone!
Tsubasa...
Germany is strong. No doubt about it.
But we're not going down without a fight!\nLet's hit 'em with a couple of goals and show 'em\nthat we're not about to back down!
That's right. Forget the score, let's just\ngive 'em everything we've got all the\nway to the final whistle!
Matsuyama, Coach wanted me to tell ya...
...
I'm... on defense?
Okay! I'm on it!
Hyuga.
Tsubasa...
You remember how we used to play when we came up\nagainst each other? I don't see that spark here.\nFind that fire, and let's toast Germany!
...
You're Japan's ace striker, Hyuga.\nYou've got this.
Tsubasa, you devil...
(He's right... I AM the striker, and I'm NOT\nletting this game end like this!)
Looks like it's finally time to strut\nyour stuff on the field, <avatar_name>.
I can't believe you get to play before me,\nbut it is what it is.
If you're going in, you'd better make it count.\nGo all out!
Japan's 分岐統合10... Tsubasa Ozora...
That must be the guy Wakabayashi\nwas always talking about.
Huh.
Lookin' at 'im, he does have\na certain presence about him.
Hey! About practice tonight...
Sorry, but we can't make it!
We actually have to attend extra lessons.
It's not easy being a student and playing soccer.
Why are you guys still here? You're gonna be late!
Why are you guys still here? You're gonna be late!
Yeah, yeah... We're going.
Get a move on. We'll see you tomorrow!
Oh, hey there <avatar_name>.\nYou not doing anything?
My foot's not 100%, so I gotta\ntake it a little easy, though.
But practice makes perfect, and that\nmakes me want to practice all the time.
You've seen all our games so far, right? How do\nyou think we stack up against the other teams?
Oh, hey there <avatar_name>.\nYou're not doing anything?
Why don't we practice together!
My foot's not 100%, so I gotta take it a little\neasy, though.
But practice makes perfect, and that makes me want\nto practice all the time.
You've seen all our games so far, right? How do\nyou think we stack up against the other teams?
Eh, they're not so great.
Those international teams\nare insane.
What do you think, Tsubasa?
Now, that's some confidence.
You think so too, huh?
Me?
If I'm being honest, I think\nI can hold my own against them.
But as captain of the team,\nI've still got work to do.
I mean, we put everything we had\ninto the past two games and still lost.
It's painfully obvious that the team needs\nto improve if we're to come out ahead.
But the world is truly vast.
Huh? Who could it be?
Now, that's some confidence.
You think so too, huh?
Me?
If I'm being honest, I think I can hold my own\nagainst them.
But as captain of the team, I've still got work to\ndo.
I mean, we put everything we had into the past two\ngames and still lost.
It's painfully obvious that the team needs to\nimprove if we're to come out ahead.
But the world is truly vast.
It's only been a few days since we got here, and\nwe've met one amazing player after another,\nincluding Schneider.
Being able to play against such skilled players...\nI couldn't be happier.
Huh? Who could it be?
Tsubasa!
Oh, hey guys.
What are you doing out here this late?
Do you need to ask? We're here to practice.
Judging from the past two matches,\nI'm sure we've got more surprises in store for us,\nso I'm focusing on my sprints.
Do you need to ask? We're here to practice.
Judging from the past two matches, I'm sure they've\ngot more surprises in store for us, so I'm\nfocusing on my sprints.
I was jogging. I've more or less shaken off\nthe fatigue from the Junior Hero League.
So I figured if I want to ramp up my training,\nit's about time I got my head in the game.

If we want to win, practice\nis the only road I see.
If we want to win, practice is the only road I\nsee.
Ain't that right, Tsubasa?
Ain't that right, Tsubasa?
Yeah.
We all want the same thing...
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
I mean we're talking about us,\nright? I know we can do it.
No doubt!
Ummm... Could I join the circle too?
!
!
It's you!
It can't be...!
Been awhile, Tsubasa.\nAnd everyone else too, of course.
I knew you'd come, Misaki!
It's Misaki!
Yo.
I've been waiting to see you for so long!
Sorry for not being able to\nstay in touch, Tsubasa.
It doesn't matter!\nAll that matters is that you're here, now!
So when'd you arrive in America, Misaki?
Just now. Mr. Katagiri came\nto pick me up at the airport.
Still, it's like no one's changed.\nI recognized everyone almost immediately.\nStill being "friends with the ball," right?
You haven't changed much yourself, either.
I guess so.
Hey, so if you're here, then does that mean...?
Yeah, I'm representing Japan, too.
F-For real?!
It wasn't an easy decision, but in\nthe end I couldn't pass up a chance\nto play with you guys again.
I hope I won't be in the way,\nbut I'm truly glad to be here.
Don't worry about it! I know you'll do fine!
We need to work hard and\nresurrect the Golden Duo!
Definitely. Thanks, Tsubasa.
By the way, I don't think we've met?
Oh, this is your first time\nmeeting Misaki, isn't it?
Well, go on. Introduce yourself.
Oh, this is your first time meeting Misaki, isn't\nit?
Well, go on. Introduce yourself.
I'm <avatar_name>.
Your reputation precedes you.\nI'm <avatar_name>.
I'm the young soccer prodigy.
I'm Taro Misaki.\nNice to meet you, <avatar_name>.
My pleasure. I'm Taro Misaki.\nNice to meet you, <avatar_name>.
Wh-What confidence...
I'm Taro Misaki.\nNice to meet you, <avatar_name>.
Alright, now let's all get back to practice!
Tak!
You too, Misaki! Let's kick the\nball around like old times!
I'd love to, but...
In order to officially join the team, the Japan\nSoccer Association has all these formalities I\nhave to deal with.
So, sorry. I can't just yet.
Oh, okay...
But once everything's taken care of, I should be\nable to join in tomorrow. See you then!
Sure! Tomorrow it is! I can't wait!
Me neither! Later!
...
(Tsubasa and Misaki led Nankatsu SC to the\nchampionship together, back in elementary school.\nAnd now they're finally together again.)
(As long as they can play like they\ndid back then... Or maybe even...)
Listen up, everyone.
After the games so far, I'm sure you realize the\nextent of the challenges you now face.
So with that in mind, this match we'll\nbe trying out a new formation.
First, Matsuyama.
Yes?
In the last match with Germany, our defensive\nplay improved after you joined the defenders.\nThat seriously helped out the whole team.
So today, I want you starting in\nthe back, leading the defenders.
Yessir!
Your midfield position will be taken over by\nMisaki. He'll be joining the starting line-up.
Huh?
I know you're new to the team, but your skills\nare the real deal. That was evident in practice.
Along with Tsubasa's support, you can turn\nit into a midfield game. I don't think there's\nanyone better suited to that task than you.
Y-Yessir! I'll do my best!
Don't worry, you'll do fine!
Yeah, let's do this, Tsubasa!
And finally...
I'm putting <avatar_name>\nin the starting line-up.
Yes, Coach! I won't let you down!
Me? In the starting line-up?!
Finally! Now's my time to shine!
Good. Try to experiment and\nfind what you're best at.
Yes, you. You were chosen to represent\nJapan, so show some confidence. And make\nsure not to forget it when you hit the field.
Well, at least I don't have to\nworry about you being timid.
Give it all you've got!
Today's opponents are from Uruguay, a\nSouth American country. They're a team\nwith speed and technique to spare.
But don't let that bother you. Winners overcome.
Don't let them set the pace.\nFind your own rhythm! Got it?
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
(This'll be my first match against a team from\nSouth America. I've been dreaming of going there\nfor what feels like forever.)
(Will my own South American-style\nplay even work against them?)
(If it does, then it should work in Brazil too...)
You've made first string. As the veteran,\nI can't be lettin' you outshine me.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\n<avatar_name>. Get in there and beat Uruguay!
Listen up, everyone.
Now that you've come this far, I imagine you all\nhave some idea of what you're truly up against.
So with that in mind, this match we'll\nbe trying out a new formation.
First up, Matsuyama.
Yes, Sir.
In the last match with Germany, our defensive\nplay improved after you joined the defenders.\nThat seriously helped out the whole team.
So today, I want you starting in\nthe back, leading the defenders.
Got it!
Your midfield position will be taken over by\nMisaki. He'll be joining the starting line-up.
Huh?
I know you're new to the team, but your skills\nare the real deal. That was evident in practice.
Along with Tsubasa's support, you can turn\nit into a midfield game. I don't think there's\nanyone better suited to that task than you.
Yes, Coach! I won't let you down!
Don't worry, you'll do fine!
Yeah, let's do this, Tsubasa!
And finally...
I'm putting <avatar_name>\nin the starting line-up.
Yes, Coach! I'll do my best!
Me? In the starting line-up?!
Finally! Now's my time to shine!
Good. Try to experiment and\nfind what you're best at.
Yes, you. You were chosen to represent Japan,\nso show some confidence. And make sure\nnot to forget it when you hit the field.
Well, at least I don't have to\nworry about you being timid.
I'm expecting 100% out of you!
You're taking on England today, captained by\nRobson playing defender. They're going to push\nhard and fast, so look out.
That means they're gonna play a lot like Italy.\nWho we came up against first.
You're gonna get a close look at the\nEuropean counter today. Learn the\ntempo and prepare for the real thing!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
Yes, Coach!
You've made first string. As the veteran,\nI can't be lettin' you outshine me.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\n<avatar_name>. Get in there and beat England!
I'm gonna go train with Nitta.\nWhat're you gonna do?
I'd like to work\non my combo plays.
I'd like to iron out\nsome stuff alone.
I don't feel much\nlike practicing.
Perfect. Come with!
Practice time with the Otomo Trio!
So you already have a personal project picked out?\nNice!
Good luck with that! If you need any help,\nyou know where to find us.
...
If you only practice when you feel like it,\nyou'll never...
Leave 'im alone, Nitta.\nThis isn't Otomo MS, so let him do what he wants.
Fine.
See ya later!
Got a minute, <avatar_name>?
You haven't been putting much into\npractice lately. What's going on?
You're not letting your recent success\nbecoming a starter go to your head, are you?
What makes you\nso high and mighty?
Ah, I'm sorry.\nI'll work harder.
You talk like that to\nsomeone on first-string?
I can't believe you!
<avatar_name>...\nNormally, I'd tell you respect someone older\nthan you, but I can't say I never have...
But I'll tell you one thing. Those who don't\npractice never improve, and one of these days,\nsome hard worker is gonna blow by you.
Let's go, Urabe.
Yeah.
It's good you're honest with yourself.
You're only where you're at because of the effort\nyou've put in this far. Don't you ever forget it!
Wha--?!
What's gotten into you, <avatar_name>?
You know what... I'm not even angry.
C'mon, Nitta.\nLet's not waste our time on someone like him.
Oh, okay.
...
What's gotten into you, <avatar_name>?\nYou seem extra charged today!
We're not going to be outdone\nby a corner-cutter like you!
N-Not bad, <avatar_name>...
Y-You've got some stamina.
Actually, you look different today. Like,\nyou got a different look in your eyes.
Seriously. Did something happen? You've\nnever seemed this motivated before.
I've been thinking about my future.
I'm aiming for the World Cup!
Your future, huh?
I think that's a great attitude! Keep pushing\nyourself, and the rest of us'll try and keep up!
Now you're sounding like Tsubasa.
What's wrong with that? I'd love\nto play in the World Cup, too.
Whatever, dreams are cheap.
What?! Just watch me! I'm definitely going to now!
(<avatar_name> will be okay\nif he keeps this up, right?)
(I wonder what happened to spark this fire.)
Hey, what's with that pace,\n<avatar_name>? You're gonna\nbe last, you know! Where's your drive?!
Just forget about him. If we slow down to\nmatch his pace, it'll just hurt our training, too.
Y-Yeah...
(I mean, I can't hold his hand forever.)
(At this point, nothing I say would\nget through to him, would it?)
I knew you would pull through, Nitta!
Thank you for believing in me!
That was awesome, Nitta!
Your falcon has now\ntraveled the world!
Thanks, <avatar_name>!
Heh, the world... Imagine that. Thanks!
That was amazing! I haven't seen that shot\nsince the Shizuoka Regionals!
You're not the only one who's gotten better,\ny'know. Next time we play, you'll be\nin for a real challenge, Tsubasa.
I can see that.
Alright! Let's go and wrap this game up!
Tak! In it to win it!
I can't believe I let them\nget off a counteroffensive play.
Forget about it, Jean. It's time to switch gears.\nThe game isn't over yet.
Sorry...
We don't know the meaning of the word defeat!\nLet's go, men!
I'm just glad you're back to normal, <avatar_name>.
But what happened to you?
Actually...
Coach did something for me...
Oh, really?
He did? Tell us more.
Coach!
What is it?
I heard from <avatar_name> that you gave him\nsome guidance as to his attitude in training.\nWe all really appreciate that.
I wouldn't say I did all THAT much.
He just realized what was happening\nand picked himself up on his own.
I've been in the soccer business a long time, you\nknow, and I've seen a lot of talented players.
But unfortunately, more than a few of them\nnever make anything of themselves.
And of those, most of them take their success for\ngranted and cut corners on their training, letting\ntheir talent go to waste.
<avatar_name>, your talent is an amazing thing,\nand that's precisely why I want you\nto never let up on your training.
Keep up this new attitude and become\na real hero to the sport, alright?
You did your part, too.
You too, of course.
You too, of course.
I'll always give it my all!
Junior Youth World Challenge\nDay of the Finals
That morning...
Alright, that's enough for a morning warm-up.\nHow're you all feeling?
I'm at the top of my game!
I'm just a little tired.
Good to hear!\nTry to take that into the match, too.
Hey, you're even younger than me! Don't be lazy!
Ishizaki, how old are we now...?
There's something I need to tell you guys.
What's the matter, Tsubasa?
Actually, for today's match...
I want <avatar_name> to act as vice captain.
You're now vice captain?
Yeah.
Ever since we came to America,\nI've been watching over this team as its captain.
But <avatar_name>'s the one who really pulled\nus through. He's put in the effort both on the\nfield and in practice.
The way he's worked to pull this team together\nand move us forward can't be overstated.
Hmm...
And for all of us third years,\nthis really is our final match.
For the next two years, I'm sure he'll take\nthe reins to lead middle school soccer.
And he'll need this sort of experience. It's\nimportant he gets it in such an important match.
What d'you all think?
Sounds good to me! <avatar_name>'s got the drive.
If you think it's fine, then why not?
Well, if it's <avatar_name>,\nthen I guess it's fine.
Sure, why not?
I approve.
I think it's a good idea, too!
Me too.
Whatever you say, Tsubasa!
He's younger than us, but sure, why not?
Coach...
So no objections to <avatar_name>\nbeing the vice captain then?
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Got it.
Then I'm officially appointing <avatar_name>\nas vice captain for the finals.
Now, go give a speech.
I-I'll do my best!
Your dreams are in good hands, guys!
Is everyone ready to be the best in the world?!
No need to be so nervous.\nJust play like you always do!
Hah, that's good to hear!\nYou carry our dreams with you, Vice Captain!
You know it! I can already see our victory parade!
To be frank, I never imagined you'd\nbecome vice captain of the All-Japan team.
Don't back down now that you've got\nresponsibilities. It's gonna take more than 110%\nto become best in the world.
But it's a bit late to be worried about that.\nGood luck and congrats, <avatar_name>!
Alright!\nThen we're counting on you, <avatar_name>!
Time to take on the world!
(His movements are unusually adept.\nHe's gained more than skill here...\nHe's found confidence, too.)
(Come to think of it, maybe he's the one\nwho's carried the team this far.)
(Either way, seeing him grow into one of the\npillars of the team does my heart proud.)
Nice one, <avatar_name>!\nYou scored a goal in the finals!
Heh, thank you!
I wonder if everyone at\nOtomo MS is watching?
Naturally!
The match isn't over just yet.\nUse the momentum to score another! Got it?
You know them! Of course, they're watching!
Simply incredible!
That's <avatar_name> for ya!
Okay, now keep it up and score another!
You're cocky! But I get it.
Still, don't let up.\nIt's not over until it's over, so keep at it.
(Magnificent, <avatar_name>.\nYou've long since surpassed my expectations.)
(I'm proud of you, boy.)
(But I'm sure you're not done wreaking havoc yet!\nMake full use of the time left!)
Alright, <avatar_name>!
Wow, dude. Who would've known you'd come this far.
I owe it to teammates\nlike you!
All that practice paid off!
I'll be Otomo's ace\nstriker next year!
That makes me happy,\nbut we honestly didn't do much.
Your hard work paid off. Good stuff!
It sure did!
With a play like that, everyone will\nwanna work even harder from now on!
Nitta's not one to just let this go,\nthough. That guy hates losing.
But we can worry about that later. Right now,\nwe need to focus on winning the championships.\nGot it?
You may be behind on the scoreboard right now,\nbut your soccer is just as good as theirs!
Plus, I can tell you for sure that the audience\ncan tell how much fun you're having out there!
I mean, even people in the American seats\nare cheering for you guys!
Just have faith that you're playing soccer right,\nand you'll pull it off!
Now go give it everything you've got\nin the remaining time!
Yes, Coach!
Finally, just one more half to go.
And then it's goodbye, Tsubasa.
Misaki...
I know I said the same thing three years ago,\nbut let's end this with a win.
Tak!
You seem to have caught Ryan's attention,\n<avatar_name>.
With him gunning for you like that,\nhe must think of you as a rival.
He's MY rival!
I doubt it.
I see. So you consider him direct competition?
You don't?
Well either way, you seem to be\nenjoying yourself out there.
Having a rival is beneficial.
The drive to beat a rival is like iron sharpening\niron. That's how Kishida, myself, and the others\ngot stronger.
You've always taken on impressive challenges,\nand having a rival will be another of these.
We're not just going to take this sitting down.\nTake 'em down in the second half!
I know what it feels like to face a rival.\nDo us proud, and take 'im down!
The man who burst onto the scene like a comet,\n<avatar_name>!
You did it, <avatar_name>!\nI knew you had it in you!
Congrats on earning MVP. Even\nI was following your lead this time.
Let's aim for the World Cup together!
Yeah, let's both do our best!
For the World Cup!
Tak! There's still much to be achieved!
Tak! It'll take all our dedication\nto make that dream a reality.
And not only that, <avatar_name>\nwas also the top scorer!
He could easily be called the hero of\nthe Junior Youth World Challenge!
Our sincerest congratulations!
The man who burst onto the scene like a comet,\n<avatar_name>!
Amazing, <avatar_name>!\nYou really outdid yourself this time!
It's a little hard for me to say,\nbut congratulations, <avatar_name>.
I was focused on catching up to Tsubasa, but to\nthink there was another rival within my midst...\nI feel energized.
Congrats, <avatar_name>!\nI've got a lot to learn from you!
Let's aim for the World Cup together!
I'll lead Japan forward!
We'll definitely win it!
I'm not falling behind either!\nI'll see you on the pitch!
Yeah, no question! We can do it!
We're home!
No, we're not!
Oh, right! Oops. It just slipped out.
I know the feeling.
We've been here so long, and done so\nmuch... It really does feel a little like home.
But tomorrow, we're headed back to Japan.
Yeah, tomorrow's already the day...
After having so much fun together for so long,\nit'll be lonely when we have to go our separate\nways again.
But I know we'll see each other again,\nas long as we stay in the game.
Absolutely.
All the more reason to live\nit up at tonight's party!
Time to pig out!
We should try not to eat too much.
Don't forget we have to study.
You know it! I'm gonna eat and eat until I burst!
Someone's excited...
Haha! Don't worry, you're young!\nYou're still growing, so dig in!
Don't be such a wet blanket! We're young\nathletes-- We're in our eating prime!
I'm fairly certain, you won't get\ntaller just because you eat more...
Ya just gotta ruin everything.
You're still thinking of studying\nat a time like this?
I'm sure the school won't mind\nus taking one night off.
If you're really worried though, you\ncan always study on the flight home.
Then let's get this party started!
<avatar_name>... Urabe...\nCome with me. I'd like a word with you two.
O-Okay.
I wonder what this is all about.

Actually, this is about\n<avatar_name>.
I was just contacted by a Brazilian soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
And that team happens to be\ncoached by Roberto Hongo.
Huh?
You mean the same team Tsubasa's joining?!
Exactly.
I was just contacted by Mr. Cardinal.
It seems you've been scouted\nfor an American soccer club.
Huh?
I was just contacted by a German soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
Huh?
I was just contacted by a Brazilian soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
Huh?
Amazing! Scouted from overseas...
Anyway, I'd like to give a reply as soon\nas possible, but what do you think?
Please, tell them we're interested!
Can I talk to my family first?
Understood. I'll let them know.
The school team's gonna take a hit without you,\nbut what an opportunity. You should go for it!
I bet your parents will be a bit\nshocked when they hear the news.
I guess you'll need to figure out if\nyou're going alone or with your family.
Of course, the other party is aware of that,\ntoo, and they'll discuss it with your family.\nWe can save the details for later.
I'll let them know, though.
Sorry for taking you away from the party, you two.
Go enjoy yourselves. I'll join you later.
If that's it, we'll be heading back.
(Both Tsubasa and <avatar_name>\nwill lead us to the future of Japanese soccer!)
You're finally about to leave, eh <avatar_name>?
If I could have it my way, I'd rather you stay.\nBut ya gotta do what ya gotta do to make your\ndreams come true.
I can't believe you're going overseas\nto join a foreign soccer club.
I know I wouldn't've believed it if you'd\ntold me this was gonna happen last summer.
I'd be worried going overseas at your age.
The guy's tough. I'm sure he'll be fine!
By the way, I heard Tsubasa\nalready left for Brazil.
I bet you wanted to be on the same plane as him.
That's rough. You had so many things\nto take care of before you could leave.
Speaking of America, how are you going\nto get by there? How's your English?
If only you had that translator device,\nyou could've used that.
He'll be fine. He put a lot of effort into\nstudying, unlike a certain someone else.
Hey, what are you implying?
Oh, who could that be?
On the topic of Germany, Wakabayashi,\nSchneider, and the rest are already playing\nin matches between the top teams, right?
You've got a lot of work ahead\nof you if you want to catch up!
I'm looking forward to seeing you play!
I read in a magazine that you travel\na lot in the Brazilian soccer scene.\nBe sure to take care of yourself!
You'll be playing in Brazil with Tsubasa.\nYou'd better work at being even better than he is!
We can't wait to see what you'll accomplish!
<avatar_name>.
You were my teammate and my rival.
Just you wait. I'll catch up to you one day...\nThat's a promise!
Hey there. Wasn't expecting to see\neveryone from Otomo MS here.
Mr. Katagiri! What're you doing here?
I came to see <avatar_name>\noff, of course!
<avatar_name>,\nyou're in for some stiff competition.
Support staff are constantly monitoring players,\nand only the ones they judge the best of the best\nget on the roster. It's harsh.
You will be pushed to your very limits,\nbut I believe you will make it through.\nWork hard and have faith in your talents.
I heard Urabe and the rest of you\nwere headed for Nankatsu High.
We kept up with our studies while in the States.\nAnd we all passed the exam to get in!
Some of us only got through by\nthe skin of our teeth, though.
Whatever! Shortlisted or not, I'm in!
I foresee Nankatsu High and Toho Academy\nbeing in the spotlight of high school soccer.\nGood luck, boys.
Tak!
Nitta, Ichijo. You two'll be the stars\nof middle school soccer this year.
I look forward to more intense\nbattles like you fought last year.
You bet!
Just watch. We'll beat Takeshi, Sano,\nand become the national champs!
Farewell, <avatar_name>.
I hope to see you at the Youth Championship.
Bring your best shot, Nitta!
Here I go, Ichijo!
And after a juke... <avatar_name>!
What?!
Oh no!
With <avatar_name> and I as strikers,\nthe championship title is as good as ours!
Let's do this, <avatar_name>!
This one's mine!
Ack! Your shot has gotten even faster!
With our combo plays,\nthe championship title is as good as ours!
Think you can stop me, <avatar_name>?
Dang! You're as sharp as a sword!
But with you and Ichijo on our side,\nour defense will be impenetrable.
That's right. We've got this,\nso you can just focus on attacking.
With me on offense and you guys on defense,\nthe championship title is as good as ours!
You guys are really going at it.
Urabe!
I was wondering how you guys were doing,\nbut I guess there's nothing to worry about.
I can see your passion plain as day.\nBe sure to bring some back for us this summer.
Fulfill the dream that we couldn't.\nIt's up to you guys now!
Sure!
You can count on us. We'll win all our\nmatches in Regionals and Nationals!
Excuse me, am I interrupting?
Mr. Katagiri! What brings you here?
We're holding a meeting on this year's\nShizuoka Regionals. And since I was in the area,\nI thought I'd drop by.
Now that you mention it, Matsuyama called\nfrom Furano and said you'd stopped by.\nYou're a busy guy!
I'll go anywhere I'm needed,\nif it will advance Japanese soccer.
I heard Urabe and the rest of you\nwere headed for Nankatsu High.
We kept up with our studies while in the States.\nAnd we all passed the exam to get in!
Some of us only got through\nby the skin of our teeth, though.
Whatever! Shortlisted or not, I'm in!
I foresee Nankatsu High and Toho Academy\nbeing in the spotlight of high school soccer.\nGood luck, boys.
Tak!
Nitta, Ichijo, <avatar_name>, you three will\nbe the center of middle school soccer this year.
But your rivals are growing stronger every day.
That includes Sano, but also Sawada, who I know\ndesperately desires to deliver you a defeat like\nyou did him in elementary school.
At least we won't get bored.\nEither way, we'll come out on top.
We've got Ichijo, <avatar_name>,\nand a strong team behind us!
I can't wait for the season to start. Good luck.
If you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way.
Let's meet again at another youth tournament!
...
While the Junior Hero League was held in Japan,\nMunemasa Katagiri seized the opportunity to\nvisit Hamburg, Germany.
(The All-Japan Junior Youths\nare going to need him...)
Hamburg, Germany
Hya!
Nice work! That's fifty saves in a row!
Not bad, Wakabayashi.
Should I know who you are?
You may call me Katagiri. I represent\nthe Japan Soccer Association.
Mikami couldn't make it because of the training\ncamp, so I have come instead.
I came to discuss your current club and\nbringing you on to represent Japan.
I see. You said your name was Katagiri?
Mr. Mikami already mentioned this to me.
It's been three years since you came to Germany\nfrom elementary school. The growth in your skill\nhere in Hamburg has been noticeable.
As a keeper, you've come to be seen as a leader on\nthe team, and no one could miss your dominance at\nthe European Junior Youth Club Tournament.
It hasn't been all peaches and cream\nsince I got here, you know.
I got called a loser a lot back then,\nwhich turned into the occasional\nfight with a teammate.
But even so, you refused to back down, and the\nlevel of competition here has made you that\nmuch better.
Japan needs you. We need both your\nskills and your experience playing\nagainst tough international teams.
It's been a while, Wakabayashi.
Y-You...!
Karl Heinz Schneider!
Didn't you leave our club, Schneider?\nWhat do you want now?
I'm not here as a club member, but\nas a player representing Germany.
Now that I've had a chance to up\nmy game at training camp, I thought\nI'd give my skills a test drive.
I see. So you're saying--
Exactly. It's time for our usual one-on-one\nfrom outside the penalty area.
Sounds good to me. Ready when you are.
(Karl Heinz Schneider... With Wakabayashi in the\nnet, he was the striker who helped make the\nHamburg Junior Youths the top team in Europe.)
(Of course, Wakabayashi is famous\nfor never letting a ball kicked from\noutside the penalty area past him.)
(Even Tsubasa or Hyuga would be found wanting.)
(But in their mano a mano shootouts, Schneider\nand Wakabayashi are rumored to be dead even. \nTo Mikami, at any rate...)
Here I come, Wakabayashi!
I'm waiting, Schneider!
Wha--!
Gah! Well, you win this round, man. You\nmust've really been putting the work in.
I can't be a slouch when\nthe world will be watching.
And in this upcoming world tournament,\nGermany will be going straight to the top!
I'll see you there, Wakabayashi.
(So that's Germany's "Young Emperor"... I've\nseen recordings of his play, but seeing his\nskill up close definitely leaves an impression.)
(Just another hurdle for us\nto surmount for our dream...)
Mr. Katagiri...
Hmmm?
I would like to ask you to negotiate a spot\non the Japanese team for me with my club.
I would like to help Japan to\nbe number one in the world!
Later:
After players had been selected\nfrom the Junior Hero League,
preparations for the new tournament\nwere being pushed along steadily.
(This still isn't enough though.)
(We need one more. We need HIM.)
(I only hope it's still possible...)
The Junior Youth World Challenge was to\nbe a new tournament hosted in America.
In order to prepare, the All-Japan Junior Youth\nteam led by Tsubasa Ozora was facing off in\nmatches daily.
They had even developed the talent to beat\nToho Academy's high school club, which\nhad won the High School Nationals.
Confident in their abilities, the\nJapanese players are on their\nway to America in high spirits.
Alright, America!
Quiet down, will ya? You're embarrassing us.
Give it a rest. You worry too much.
Yo, cute girls alert!
H-H-Hello... M-M-My name... I'm Ryo Ishizaki!
Just what is he doing...?
Maybe we should say something, too.
I swear, he has no shame at all.
Ishizaki! We're here to play soccer, remember?
Say it ain't so... Please tell me\nyou're not another Ishizaki.
Excellent! We're going to get along just fine!
Seriously!
C'mon, don't be a wet blanket.
Live it up a little!
I'm more worried about living it DOWN!
You're just like Tsubasa, aren't you?
But I guess you're right. There'll\nbe more time for that later.
Looks like everyone's in high spirits.
For sure. Man, I'm beat though. I\ncan't stand sitting still for this long.
But this is our first International Tournament.\nMakes sense they'd be rarin' to go.
Yeah, I can't wait to take on some of the best,\neither. I wish we were already on the pitch!
You're the same as ever, Tsubasa.
And I've gotta do my part for everyone\nwho couldn't make it here, too!
Alright guys, we're heading to our\naccommodation now. Don't get lost!
Oh, right, today's a weekday, huh?
Yeah, if it weren't for the tournament,\nwe'd hafta be in school right now.
Such a shame. Just think of all the\nstudying we're missing out on.
Oh, no need to get downtrodden.
We're cooperating with your schools and teachers,\nwho have provided us with a complete curriculum.
So there is no need for concern because\nyou'll be getting plenty of both soccer\nand studying on this trip.
You must be joking...
Roger that... *sob*
Here we are. This is where we'll be staying.
Wow...
Whoa, look at all those soccer fields...
So this is the place? Pretty fancy.
Yeah, it's even nicer than the Toho Academy dorm.
I've spent time with some of the most prestigious\nteams in Europe, and even I have never received\nthis level of treatment.
This specialized soccer training facility\nwas set up by the founder of a global\nIT company, George Cardinal.
Mr. Cardinal is one of the tournament's main\nsponsors, and he was kind enough to let\nthe teams lodge and train here.
Wow, he must have some serious bank.
Well, to be more precise, everything on\nthis island was built by Mr. Cardinal.
Th-The whole island?!
Like, that huge stadium and\nthat fancy hotel?! All of it?
Yes, all of it.
Training, lodging, and of course, games,\nas well... Everything on this island was\nput together to advance American--
I mean... To advance soccer around the world.\nMr. Cardinal's said as much himself in interviews.
That probably explains why America wanted\nso badly to bring the tournament here, then.\nIt's like an advertisement for this place.
Yes, that seems likely.
Jeez...
That's really thinkin' big.
Oh, right, I also have something\nimportant to give you all.
These are automatic interpretation devices\ndeveloped by Mr. Cardinal's company.
Like pocket translators...? Seriously?
They just look like wireless earbuds.
They're pretty small though. They're\nmeant to fit right inside your ear.
These things will automatically translate\nspoken word from any language.
All you need to do is stick them in your ears. Be\nsure not to lose them, since you'll need them\nduring matches and practice.
This is amazing! With these, we can talk\nto soccer players from around the world!
Apparently they're still in the prototype stage,\nbut they're giving them to all the players and\ntournament staff as a kind of trial run.
The players here are from a wide variety of\ncultural backgrounds, so I'm sure it'll be a\nworthwhile experience for you.
Whoa, there are so many people here!
Looks like those are the teams that arrived here\nfirst. I see some members of the press, too.
As the start of the Junior Youth World Challenge\ndraws ever nearer, teams are now entering the\ngrounds.
Among them are the stand out favorites\nto win, the Germany Junior Youths,\ncurrently being swarmed by reporters.
Even amid this tournament's fierce competition,\nthis young man is expected to be the top-scorer.
Known as Germany's "Young Emperor,"\nit's Karl Heinz Schneider!
It's Europe's number one forward!
Oh, what's this? It looks like the team\nfrom the Netherlands has just arrived!
Their captain, Brian Kluivoort, is\nanother player to keep an eye on!
And yet another strong team! Italy!
Italy's Captain Zino Hernandez is considered\nthe best goalkeeper Europe has to offer.
There is much speculation as to whether\nanyone will be able to put a ball in his net.
So those are the boys from Europe, huh?
Look how cocky they are.
Yeah, you can tell how confident\nthey are just from their eyes.
Mmhmmm. I can't wait to meet them on the field!
Ah! The reporters are coming this way!
Is it finally time for my world debut?
It's always important to be ready to have your\npicture taken, y'know. How's my hair?
You've got a buzz cut!
Oh, you're leaving?
You're just gonna ignore us!
We're probably not considered much of a threat.\nThey don't think we're worth their time.
Suits me just fine! We'll just have to\nmake 'em see we deserve attention!
Oh, right, I've been meaning\nto ask you, Mr. Katagiri...
I noticed our team was registered\nwith twenty-three players...\nBut we've only got twenty-one.
Good eye. Yes, we're waiting on two more.
Actually, we're still sorting out that situation,\nbut if all goes well, they'll be joining you here\nin short order.
So who are they?
A few old friends of yours...
Genzo Wakabayashi and Taro Misaki.
Wha--!
Wakabayashi and Misaki?!
A-Are you serious?
Certainly. I'm always serious.
Wakabayashi's joining us?!
Well, there's an issue with his current club.\nWe're talking to them, but we haven't\nsettled on a date for him to join us yet.
Sounds like a real pain.
And what about Misaki?
He seems to have not made up\nhis mind about participating.
Apparently, over the past three years\nhe never joined a new club, and he\nhasn't been playing soccer seriously.
So he's not confident that he'll be able\nto keep up. He's worried that he'll\nnegatively impact the team harmony.
I can't believe it...
(You never have to worry about that, Misaki.)
(Even back in the day, it took us time\nto hit our groove. We can find it again.)
(I'm sure you've still got it.)
Tsubasa, there's no point in fretting\nover people that ain't here.
Yeah, all we can do is work with who we got.
Yeah... you're right.
Then there's no time to waste! We need to\nbe doing everything we can to get ready!
Tak!









We're winning this thing!
Time to show the world what we've got!
Let's put our hearts into this!
I'm taking MVP!
Tak! Don't hold anything back!
Yeah, that's the spirit!
Oh, you're gonna steal it from me?\nLet's rise to the top together!
Alright guys, time for a breather.
Phew... Worked up a good sweat.
Mikami, I've negotiated the pre-tourney scrims.\nWe're scheduled for three in total.
Thanks, Katagiri.
Okay, you heard him. Starting\ntomorrow, the real fight begins.
So no slacking off!
Yessir!




Still, this is a marvelous practice facility.
Yeah, it's a perfect environment.
Hey! Are you Tsubasa Ozora?
Y-Yes. And you're...?
Pardon me, I forgot to introduce myself.
I am George Cardinal. I would like to officially\nwelcome the Japanese team to my facility.
Whoa, so the old man is the president of a big\ncompany?
Hey, watch your mouth, Ishizaki!
A pleasure to meet you, sir. I am Mr. Katagiri\nof the Japanese Soccer Association.
So to what do we owe the pleasure, Mr. Cardinal?
Actually, I'd like to speak with\nTsubasa, if that would be acceptable.
Would you mind stepping out for a moment?
H-Huh? Sure, I guess...
Would you mind terribly if I accompanied you, sir?
Of course, I'm sure he'd be less nervous\nwith you along. Please, join us.
So how do you know Tsubasa?
As I'm sure you can tell, I love soccer. As such,\nI have specialized staff traversing the globe for\nme in order to gather news.
That's how I learned of a remarkably talented\nplayer from Japan. And last month I paid a visit\nto a certain Japanese tournament.
You went all the way to Japan just\nto watch a middle school tournament?
Absolutely. I'd go to the ends of the earth\nto have a chance to glimpse real talent.
The finals were especially stunning. It's not\nevery day you see a player that honestly\nleaves everything he has on the field.
By the way, Tsubasa...
Yes?
I'd like to hear what you think about\nthis place. Be honest with me.
Honestly, I think it's amazing. From\nthe fields to the equipment and the\nliving space... It's all stunning.
I see.
Then would you like to play soccer\nhere? Until you tire of it?
Huh?
What do you say? Would you like to come to\nAmerica after you graduate middle school?\nThere's always a place here for talent like yours.
...
Here's what I think. Outstanding players will\nshine their brightest in the right environment\nwhen provided with quality structure and strategy.
And your skills stand out, Tsubasa. I think\nyou'd be a perfect fit for my soccer school.\nSo what do you say?
...I appreciate the offer, but I already have\nplans to move to Brazil after graduation.
Brazil, you say?
His mentor lives in Brazil, so he\nplans to study abroad there to be\nable to continue learning from him.
I see. That's a shame.
But should you ever change your\nmind, the offer remains open.
I'd never close my door to a\nplayer with that much potential.
Well...
Not that I'd be surprised if you changed your\nmind the moment you face our American team.
What?
Almost all of the American players are\nstudents from my school, after all.
Let's just say I am looking forward\nto tomorrow's scrimmage.
Sorry to interrupt, but Coach\nsays our break's almost over.
Okay, I'm coming.
Oh, my apologies. I didn't mean to take up\nso much of your time. Best of luck out there.
Please, excuse me.
If you don't mind me asking, did you observe\nany of the games other than the finals\nbetween Nankatsu and Toho?
Oh yes, I stayed for quite some time.
Then did any players other than\nTsubasa happen to catch your eye?
No, I'm afraid not.
Oh...?
Tsubasa had the misfortune of being\nseriously injured at the tournament.\nIn spite of that, no one could beat him.
That itself demonstrates the\nlevel of everyone else present.
...
Don't get me wrong, I mean no disrespect\nto the players or their admirable efforts.
But that's not the same thing as talent.
...
Hey, Tsubasa, so what'd\nhe want to talk to ya about?
Well...
He invited me to stay in America.\nI turned him down though.
Whoa.
But if he was scouting you, he\nmust think you're hot stuff! Nice!
(But he only wanted to talk to\nTsubasa. Which means...)
(The rest of us aren't on his radar.)
(I can't believe I'd be looked down on like that!)
(Sure, Tsubasa's good enough to get scouted...)
(But what about me?! We've clashed so many times!)
(Fine then. I'll just have to prove\nmyself in tomorrow's game!)
Alright, listen up guys.
Until now, we've been focusing on individual\nplay, but from here on out it's all real matches.
Our first game is against America,\nthe hometown favorites.
The American players have\nbeen training since childhood.
And thanks to building muscles of steel,\nthey have a habit of stampeding over other\nteams using brute strength. Watch out.
Yessir!




Now here's our starting line-up.
Forwards: Hyuga, Masao, and Nitta. Midfield will\nbe Tsubasa, Matsuyama, and Kazuo.
On defense we'll have Soda, Jito, Takasugi, and\nIshizaki. Wakashimazu will be in the goal.
Even if your name wasn't called, you might be\nswitched in at any moment, so stay on your toes.
Okay!




Just look at this fantastic line-up.
We even beat the best high schoolers in Japan.
Remember, we're not tourists... We're here to win!
When we go home, let's do it\nwith zero losses on our record.
Heck yeah!




Are you sure about this, Mikami?
Didn't we gather all that data on\nthe other teams in this tournament?
Was it really alright not to tell them more about\nthe players they face on the American team?
I know what I'm doing, Katagiri.
This is something they need to experience for\nthemselves, while it's still only a scrimmage.
Yes... I suppose you're right.
It's time for the All-Japan Junior Youths to face\ntheir first foreign opponents since the team came\ntogether! Japan versus America!
The players from the fierce\nNational MS Soccer Tournament are finally\nmaking their debut on the world stage!
Will Tsubasa, Hyuga, and the rest of the gang\nbe able to compete at this level? The eagerly\nawaited game is about to begin!
Seriously? We're up against these scrawny nerds?
Say that again, I dare you!
Fine, whatever. Maybe you were big fish back in\nyour small pond, but it's time someone showed you\nwhat real soccer looks like!
(This is where it all starts. Our\nbattle spanning the world of soccer!)
And there's the starting whistle!
Here we go!
Łoł! And Captain Tsubasa starts off strong,\ncharging forward with his trademark swift dribble!
Ha! Like you'd ever get past me!
C'mon!
What?!
What a skill! Tsubasa slips past\nBlake with a flawless feint!
Someone stop him!
We've got this!




America's defense is swarming towards Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
Got it, Tsubasa!
Tsubasa and Hyuga are giving 'em the ol'\none-two! The middle school dream team\nslips through the American defense!
(We're just getting started!)
And Tsubasa immediately readies a shot!
He's still quite a ways outside the penalty box,\nbut this is well within Tsubasa's threat range!
Drive Shot!
And Tsubasa's famous Drive Shot paints\na brilliant arc across the American sky!
It looks like Japan's taking an early--
What the--?!
I-I can't believe what I'm seeing! Azwan, the\nAmerican goalie, just caught Tsubasa's Drive Shot!
You call that a Drive Shot? Don't make me laugh.
I'd say you're all bark and no bite, but that was\nmore like a puppy licking my face.
No way... He stopped it so easily...
C'mon! You gotta be able to do better than that!
Azwan carelessly tosses the ball away! Is he\nmocking the Japanese players?!
Y-You...! We'll make you regret that!
Hyuga retrieves the ball and--!
Suck on this, America!
Here it comes...! Hyuga's Tiger Shot!
With the Fierce Tiger on the hunt,\nsurely this time Japan's players will--
What the--?!
I-It's no use! Azwan hands find the ball again!\nHyuga's Tiger Shot is snatched out of the air!
Did he just call you a "tiger"? Seriously, this\ntranslator doohickey must be busted.
And Azwan tosses the ball back onto open field\nagain! He's definitely taunting the Japanese team!
Why you...! You can't be serious!
And another easy catch by Azwan...\nI still can't believe what I'm seeing.
Soda's Razor Shot, Matsuyama's\nEagle Shot, Nitta's Falcon Shot...
And even the Tachibana brothers' Skylab Hurricane!\nAzwan has derailed every train to victory!
You've gotta be kidding us.


Wow, lucky me!
Never thought I'd get to see a real\ncircus act on the soccer field!
Yo, Azwan! You gonna mess around all day?
Lighten up, dude. Here, have the ball.
Alright, now it's MY turn!
And America's counterattack begins! Blake, the\ncenter forward, surges into Japanese territory!
Stop him!
Outta my way!
Nooo!
Blake's dribble has so much momentum\nthat Ishizaki is sent flying!
I've got some muscle, too, y'know!
Muscle up!
Uaaah!
What a shocker, even Jito, known for his\nPower Defense, is easily brushed aside!
I'll show you a REAL kick!
I'm ready!
Startling! Blake's shot drove past\nWakashimazu's hands and entered\nthe goal! America scores the first goal!
What?! It was in my hands... What power!
What do ya think? That's my patented Blake Shot!
Cool shot but suuuper dumb name, Blake.
Come on! So not only can they block all our\nshots, but that guy's got a golden kick!
Don't panic. There's still time on\nthe clock. We can bring it back!
And the match restarts! Can Japan overcome the\nshock of losing the lead and even out the score?
Tsubasa!
Will Tsubasa be able to rally his team?
Oh? So you're relying on this Tsubasa guy then?
Get him, boys!
On it!




What's this? The American team\nis charging right toward Tsubasa!
Ugh!
You think that'll slow me down?
Tsubasa refuses to back down, and\ndribbles right past the American defense!
What an astonishing run! He's slipped right\npast 5 American defense players!
That's Japan's very own soccer\nprodigy, Tsubasa Ozora!
But can he get past this sixth player?
You're mine!
Oh my! Blake waited out the feint\nbefore going for a fierce tackle!
!
Gaaah!
And Blake tackles Tsubasa,\nwho is hit pretty hard.
Naturally, that's another foul!
You okay, Tsubasa?
Gah! My leg...!
Tsubasa is holding his left ankle! Is an old\ninjury bothering him once more?
What the heck are you guys doing?!\nAre you TRYING to injure him?!
The little baby can't take a real\ntackle? Soccer is a battle, bro!
It's dog eat dog here, bud! If that's enough to\ntake you out then you don't belong here!
What's wrong with you?!
And now there's some movement on\nthe Japanese bench. It looks like Tsubasa\nis being swapped out for Sawada!
Coach, you don't need\nto do this! I can still play!
Tsubasa, I like your guts, but this is just\na scrimmage. We can't take chances here.\nYou need to see a doctor.
Fine... I understand.
Tsubasa...
Get it done, Takeshi!
Y-You got it!
It seems that Tsubasa is indeed leaving the\nfield. I hope he hasn't hurt his leg too badly.
And that's the game!
The Japan versus America pre-match\nends 3-0, America wins!
Japan did their best to hang on with\nSawada after Tsubasa swapped out,
but the American defense tore their passes to\nshreds, and they couldn't manage to mount\na proper offense.
Not only that, Japan appeared helpless in\nthe face of America's unrelenting assault.
In the end, the game ended with America\ndictating the pace from start to finish.
You could almost say Japan crashed headfirst\ninto the wall of international competition.
We... lost.
I couldn't do a thing...
So this is international soccer...?
That wasn't even worth our time.\nWhy'd we agree to this match again?
I bet it was just for the data.\nThat's just the sorta thing he'd do.
Sure, but what kinda data could\nwe even get from these wimps?
Well, y'know... We're in different\nbrackets, and these guys won't\nmake it past the preliminaries anyway.
Haha!


You think winning one game means\nyou can just say whatever you want?
We're barely standin' over here,\nand they're laughin' it up?
We didn't even push them to try hard...
Guys...
How's your ankle, Tsubasa?
Just a light sprain. I'll need to adjust my\ntraining for a couple days, but that's all.
Really? Whew, that's at least some good news.
But still, what they did to you was reprehensible.
Yeah... So this is international soccer, huh?
(For all intents and purposes, this match was\nover the moment Tsubasa was forced out.)
(After they had crushed Tsubasa,\nthe rest of the team just folded.)
(Which means if we don't want Tsubasa to get\nmobbed every game, we'll need someone else to draw\nfire--someone who can keep up with him. But who?)
(And not only that, we couldn't keep up with the\nother team's play at all. Our teamwork fell to\npieces under just a little strain.)
(We're still a long way from being ready to\ncompete on the world stage.)
(But what can we do...?)
Too bad you didn't get a chance to\nplay today, <avatar_name>.
I'm sure you could tell, we didn't stand a chance.
I really wanted to win, you know? Since this was\nour first game representing Japan. But then...
Coach should've let me play!
I wouldn't have made a difference anyway.
What matters is that you did your best.
It's Coach's fault for benching me!
You really shouldn't say that sort of thing...\nEven if that's really how you feel.
Remember that frustration, and use\nit as fuel to train even harder.
Humility's great and all, but maybe you should be\nmore frustrated than feeling lackluster.
It's important to value your teammates, but never\nforget that they're your rivals too.
...And that's the problem.
So that was our best... And it\ndidn't amount to diddly squat.
The gap is just too big...
Never, ever, say that in front of anyone else.
You've never heard any of the benched members of\nFurano MS say anything like that, have you?
I get that you're frustrated, so bury that\nfeeling in your gut. It's like a spring, and the\nmore tension you apply, the more you'll improve.
It's a shame you didn't get\na chance to play, <avatar_name>.
It makes sense for me to sit out these\nscrimmages due to my heart condition,\nbut you must be on edge.
So how'd you feel about the match?\nSeen from the bench, I mean.
This wouldn't have happened if I were out there.
It would've gone even worse with me out there.
They gave their all, but we still lost...
I need to be a starting player next time.
Yeah, the more confident you are,\nthe more frustrating it must be.
But take that frustration, and turn it into a\nwell. Let it fill up, and you can unleash\nit next time you hit the field.
Are those your honest feelings?\nIf so, then we have a problem.
I want you to turn your frustration\ninto strength instead.
That's what I've been doing.\nFor a long, long time now.
Yes, exactly.
In other words, this just proves\nthat we're not good enough yet.
This is worse than I thought...
I'm glad you're confident, but that's going a bit\nfar. Coach has his reasons.
Instead, I want you to focus\non why you weren't chosen.
You didn't get a chance to play, did you\n<avatar_name>?
Well, you saw what happened\nout there. We were pathetic!
I never knew it could be\nso frustrating not to play!
It would've been the same even if I played.
But you did your best...
The coach was an idiot to bench me!
Yeah, age don't matter here...\nThat's gotta be rough for any player.
But let that emotion drive your\nmotivation. Then you can let it\nall out when you hit the pitch!
Aren't you just running away?\nPretending it doesn't hurt?
The moment you think you can't improve,\nthat's when you're over as an athlete.
Have some pride! Make your anger your strength.\nLet that frustration catapult you to victory!
That makes it even worse! Our best was pathetic!
...Sorry for shoutin' at ya. I\nneed to go cool off for a bit.
...I getcha. I mean, really... I do.
But if you wanna say that to his face,\nyou need the skill to back it up.
So get those skills first! Then you say it!
Whatever... What's done is done.
But don't get lazy just 'cuz you sat out a game.\nWatch the game like you're about to go in.
Hmmm?
(What's this feeling...?)
Tsubasa! The coach wants to see you!
Okay, I'm coming!
So that's Tsubasa Ozora, huh?
He actually might be quite impressive.
I can't wait to see what this\ntournament makes of him.
So that's Tsubasa Ozora, huh?
He actually might be quite impressive.
I can't wait to see what this tournament makes of\nhim.
Okay, everybody listen up.
Germany's fielding a top-notch team, and\nthey're a favorite to win the tournament.
They've got "Young Emperor" Schneider as forward\nthis year. Word is he's the best in all of Europe.
He's probably the one player who\ncan get a goal past Wakabayashi.
...Even Wakabayashi?!
Germany's got a lot of talent in scoring\npositions, so defenders need to stay\non their toes.
...
They'll be tough team to beat, but I want you to\nstay focused and conquer that field.
Alright, here's the starting line-up.
Forwards: Hyuga, Nitta, Sano.\nMidfield: Matsuyama, Sawada, Izawa.
Defenders: Soda, Jito, Takasugi, Ishizaki.\nWakashimazu's in the goal.
No Tsubasa...
That American player got him\npretty good, I hope he's okay.
Tsubasa, the doc updated me on your injury.
He says you're okay to play for a bit, but I'm\nthinking it's better you stay off your feet\nuntil that ankle is fully healed.
But I--
Listen, I know you want to play, but the\ntournament's more important and we\ndon't need to take any chances.
Y-Yes, Sir.
Okay. Hyuga, you're captain for this one.\nI'm counting on you to lead out there.
Yes, Sir!
(That Schneider guy is Europe's top forward...)
(But hey, I'm the ace striker for\nthe All-Japan Junior Youth!)
(AND I'm captain now. There's no way\nI'm letting this match turn out like our\nsad outing against the Americans.)
(Time to score some goals and win this thing!)
(The world's gonna see just what Japan can do.)
Heine, watch midfield.
No problem. Even one-legged, I\ncould run circles around these guys.
Just be sure you don't underestimate them.
You say something, Schester? I'd think\nyou'd have a little more respect for what\nI can do after the last time I took you down.
Shuvit!
You two, cut it out!
You two, cut it out!
The match is about to start.\nYou wanna fight, do it after.
Truth hurts...
I heard that, Heine.
Gotta watch out for those big ears...
We're moments away from the start of\nour second pre-tournament scrimmage,\nwhere Japan will faceoff against Germany.
Japan is coming off a stinging loss to the\nUnited States, but can they redeem themselves\nagainst the mighty German lineup?
And there's the whistle!
Okay, show us what you got, Germany!
Hyuga's not wasting any time, taking\nhis patented Straight Line Dribbel\ndirectly through German lines!
End of the line!
End of the line!
Outta my way!
Ooof!
Ooof!
Looks like we got a tough guy.
Coming through!
Łoł!
Hyuga powers past Heine...
Ahem.
What the--?!
Correction! In a flash, Heine has used his\nankles to steal the ball away from Hyuga!
It's my ball, now. Let's go, boys!
Now Heine leads the German\nattack into the Japan backfield!
Coach, who's that?
That's Cornelius Heine. He plays for Dresden's\nall youth team in eastern Germany.
Genzo and Schneider took a real beating from\nhim during the Junior Youth Tournament in Germany\nwhen they were on the Hamburg team.
That guy outplayed Wakabayashi?!
Indeed. I wasn't expecting to see him back on the\nfield so soon. He hurt his ankle badly in a\ncollision with Schneider in that match.
But seeing as he's recovered, Germany's\nmidfield is boasting some impressive talent.
I'm bringing you down!
Ya ain't gettin' by me!
Sorry, guys. You're just too slow.
The fleet-footed Heine expertly\nsails past the incoming tackles!
Ishizaki! We've gotta stop this guy!
Alright!
Now it's Takasugi and Ishizaki heading for Heine!
Schneider!
Darn it!
Heine's through pass rockets the ball between\nIshizaki and Takasugi, and right to the waiting\nfeet of Schneider!
Nice pass, Heine.
Alright, let's go!
And Schneider takes his shot\nfrom outside the goal box!
Wha--?!
And it's in! Ace striker Schneider sends\nGermany into an early lead over Japan!
What a tremendous shot!\nGoalkeeper Wakashimazu looked frozen out there!
Th-That was Hyuga's Tiger Shot!
(Yeah, I know. Captain's hit me\nwith a hundred of those in practice.)
(But that wasn't a normal Tiger Shot.\nThere was some spin on it, too.)
(It's tough to believe, but that shot was even\nbetter than Captain's Tiger Shot!)
Stoppage Time: First Half
Here we are, only minutes\nfrom the end of the first half!
With an assist from Heine, Schneider's\ntwo goals and Margus's one put\nGermany ahead of Japan three to zero!
And in the midfield, Heine, Schester, and Kaltz\nhave Japan's Sawada and Matsuyama on lockdown!
(Gotta get the ball to Hyuga somehow...\nWe need a goal before the halftime...)
Takeshi, look out!
Huh?
I'll take that!
No!
Amazing! Sawada falters, and Schester\nswoops in instantly to take possession!
Kaltz!
Heine!
Schneider!
Even during the added time, the German\nmidfielders aren't pulling any punches\nas they deftly pass back and forth!
And the ball is back to Schneider!
One more for good measure!
And Schneider takes yet another\nlong shot from outside the box!
Not this time!
Gah!
Unbelievable! Wakashimazu moves to stop the ball,\nbut the force of Schneider's kick keeps him from\nholding on to the ball as it goes into the net!
And there's the whistle to end the first half!
Germany's "Young Emperor" shows off his regal\npedigree with a hat trick in the opening half.
Nice defense, Schester.
Solid play. I never was able to figure out\ndefensive midfield, myself.
You ask, I play. I'll go wherever I'm needed.
You know, we've got ourselves a pretty talented\ncrew! I mean, I guess that's me too, but...
You know, we've got ourselves a pretty talented\ncrew! I mean, I guess that's me too, but...
Yeah, my gramps said the same thing:\n"We'd have never been able to field\nthat level of team in my day."
I mean, if we've got any weak spots...\nMaybe our keeper?
I mean, if we've got any weak spots...\nMaybe our keeper?
Hey, not so loud!
Hey Schneider, that Fire Shot's lookin'\na lot more powerful than it used to.
You noticed, huh?
How could I not? I've been watching\nyou play since you were a kid.
My Fire Shot made me the best in Europe, but I\nfigured it needed some more juice if I wanted to\nbe number one in the world.
Hey, good job so far everybody!
Not too bad yourself, Heine.
How'd you like that pass?
Yeah, perfect placement.
I thought I might take the shot myself, but\nclearly letting you have it was the right\nchoice. You're definitely the better shooter.
But just by a little bit.
...
You really do play a lot\nlike your father, Schneider.
My father?
Yeah, Hamburg's star player! I used to\nlove watching him when I was little.
The way you attack the space, the way you receive\nyour passes... Even your timing when you shoot...\nIt's the same way he used to play.
You know, you might be right. He is the man\nwho taught me everything about the game.
Yeah, exactly! I first recognized the style\nwhen we were all training together.
I used to watch videos of your\ndad's matches to study passing.
And it seemed logical I could use\nhis tricks to get the ball to you.
I should probably try watching\na few of those games, too.
Speaking of, what's your dad up to these days?
Ummm...
He was the fill-in coach for\nHamburg before, right?
...
What?
Did I say something wrong?
...Just let it go.
Okay... Well, good luck out\nthere in the second half.
What, you're coming off too? I know Schneider was\nsupposed to just play the first half, but...
What, you're coming off too? I know Schneider was\nsupposed to just play the first half, but...
Yeah, my foot's not a hundred percent yet.\nPlus, we're already gonna win this thing.\nNo reason to overdo it for a scrimmage.
Coach thinks you can handle it,\nand I have no reason to doubt it.
Alright, it's all on you guys, don't let us down!
God, that kid's full of himself.
They're just too good...
How does Schneider shoot\nlike that? It's ridiculous.
Heine's got some midfield magic. He couldn't be\nstopped, and he read the field like an open book.\nMade me think of Misugi, actually.
...
And Margus, Kaltz, and Schester had us\nrunning in circles. We couldn't do a thing.
...
Ey! Waitasec, look!\nLook at their bench!
It appears they're going to let\ntheir two key players rest.
The nerve...!
You gotta be kidding!
Wha...?
Tsu-Tsubasa!
Don't lose this one! Not to these jerks!
Go! Fight! Win!
Tsubasa...
(My wrist is still stinging. How did he\nput that much power on his shot?!)
Wakashimazu, we're going to have the\ndoctor take a look at your wrist, so you're\noff the pitch for the second half.
Wha-- How'd you know?
I used to be a goalie myself. It was pretty clear\nyou must've been hurt when you tried to stop that\nshot earlier. Not too bad though, right?
Right, so I can get patched up and\ncome back in for the second half!
We've still got plenty of game left! I've gotta\nget out there, and keep Schneider from\nscoring any more points. Put me in, Coach!
I know where you're coming from, but...
You need to take it easy, Wakashimazu.\nLeave the second half to us.
But Captain...
...
...Okay, I guess.
Morisaki, get warmed up.
Yes, Coach!
Morisaki...
It's okay. You can count on me.\nI don't care how tough they are.
And when they take that shot, I'm\ngonna be right there ready to stop it.
Tak! That's it!
Well, folks, it's time for the second half.
Germany has benched Schneider and Heine.\nThey must be feeling mighty comfortable after\nrunning up a four-point lead in the first half!
Meanwhile, Japan sits on its goose egg. They need\nto score if they're going to gain any momentum!
Wow! Schester smashes the ball\nthrough Japan's defense for a goal!
Only ten minutes into the second half, the\nMargus-Schester duo has already put\nup two more points for Germany!
That puts Germany ahead a whopping six to nil!
I can't... I just can't do it!
We're toast...
What's the point if we're gonna lose like this?
And that was our best too...
(That's it. We've lost.)
(Tsubasa... How could we fall so far?)
(We put everything we had into battling it out\nwith you at Nationals. The best of us got to\nrepresent Japan.)
(But look at us now. This\n"All-Japan Junior Youth" is a sham.\nOut in the real world we're nothing...)
(We're just bumbling all over the\nplace while the world watches!)
(We can't even fight back...)
COACH! Put me in! If things keep\ngoing like this the team is done for!
Please, Coach! If we can't at least give\n'em a bloody nose the team's not gonna\nbe able to live with themselves!
You're probably right.
But Tsubasa, you've gotta\nwatch yourself. Don't push it.
Roger that, Coach!
Coach, maybe put Matsuyama on\ndefense if Tsubasa's going to midfield.
Why him?
He's tough as nails, and he keeps everyone fired\nup. Having a general lead the defenders can make a\nbig difference against opponents like these.
Hmmm... It's a bold move, but he does have a\ntalent for defense. Let's give it a go.
Thank you, Coach.
One more thing...
I'm bringing you on too,\n<avatar_name>.
It might seem like overwhelming odds, but this is\nthe kind of battle you have to expect when it's\ntwo great nations squaring off.
<avatar_name>,\nlet's go turn the tide!
You can count on me!
D-Do you think we can really do it?
Full speed ahead!
Yeah, that's the spirit!
Let's go get 'em!
You're an All-Japan player because you've\ngot the right stuff. Believe in yourself!
Now let's get to it!
No doubt, that's what it's gonna take.
Now let's go push ourselves to our limits!
What's this? Japan subs out Sawada for...
Tsubasa! Despite his injury in an earlier\ngame, Tsubasa is joining his team on\nthe field for the second half!
And folks, it looks like here\ncomes a new challenger!
Joining the fight now is the new first-year\neveryone has their eyes on, <avatar_name>!
Chin up, everyone!
Tsubasa...
Germany is strong. No doubt about it.
But we're not going down without a fight!\nLet's hit 'em with a couple of goals and show 'em\nthat we're not about to back down!
That's right. Forget the score, let's just\ngive 'em everything we've got all the\nway to the final whistle!
Matsuyama, Coach wanted me to tell ya...
...
I'm... on defense?
Okay! I'm on it!
Hyuga.
Tsubasa...
You remember how we used to play when we came up\nagainst each other? I don't see that spark here.\nFind that fire, and let's toast Germany!
...
You're Japan's ace striker, Hyuga.\nYou've got this.
Tsubasa, you devil...
(He's right... I AM the striker, and I'm NOT\nletting this game end like this!)
<avatar_name>, looks like\nyou're already getting your first shot at\nthe limelight. I'm lookin' forward to this.
There's not much time left on the clock, but\nwe're gonna push 'em back. We owe it to our\nfriends from Furano who'll be watching.
It's all or nothing! Idziemy!
<avatar_name>, don't feel overwhelmed just\n'cause it's your first outing with the team.
Give it the best you've got,\nand see what you can do!
Hey, <avatar_name>!\nLooks like we finally get to play together.
It ain't over yet! We're gonna hit 'em with\neverything we've got. Now come on!
Japan's #10... Tsubasa Ozora...
That must be the guy Wakabayashi\nwas always talking about.
Huh.
Lookin' at 'im, he does have\na certain presence about him.
Alright, let's go!
I'm coming for ya, Germany!
You don't know who you're\nmessin' with.
You... You're the one \nWakabayashi told us about!
Is that really him, Japan's\n#10...?
We're not done yet!
You really intend to keep pretending\nyou have a chance, huh?
You really intend to keep pretending\nyou have a chance, huh?
What spirit!
What a match!
Still a ways to go, eh kid?
We fight to the end!
We're not done yet!
From what we were told, we should've\nexpected nothing less from him...
Seems I overestimated you.
Goooal! All-Japan ace striker and prodigy\nKojiro Hyuga scores on Germany!
Sweet shot, Hyuga!
Nice work!
Thanks.
(What else did they expect me to do?\nThis was my chance to lead, and we\nended up getting thwomped. I had to score.)
(That's my job. I'm an ace striker!\nI've got a responsibility to the team!)
And Japan falls to Germany! That's\ntheir second loss in the pre-matches!
Despite being reinvigorated by the\nreturn of Tsubasa, Japan just\ncouldn't make up for that first half.
Their players look pretty crestfallen as well.\nGet it together, Japan! There's more to come...
(Karl Heinz Schneider sure showed us why\nhe's known as the "Young Emperor" back home.)
(And Cornelius Heine... Midfielder\nto midfielder, he's one skilled player.)
(This is what we're up against if we're\ngoing to be number one in the world.)
(Sure, we were stuck in the mud in the first\nhalf, but once Tsubasa came on and Matsuyama\nswapped to defender we really found our stride.)
(This is definitely how Japan is meant to play.)
(But we could still fall apart\nif Tsubasa gets hurt.)
(We need somebody to cover\nin the future should that happen.)
(Maybe I could...)
(Nah, I'm only supposed to play a half.\nDoesn't solve the underlying problem.)
(There's gotta be something that can be done...)
(Schneider's shot...)
(That must be the kinda shot it\ntakes to be Europe's top striker...)
Captain.
Hey, Wakashimazu.
What'd the doc say about your wrist?
Bones and ligaments are okay. It's just a little\nswollen. When that goes down I'll be good to go.
Sounds good.
...
So hey, Wakashimazu. I got a question\nfor you, and I need a straight answer.
Uhhh, okay.
Which is better, my Tiger Shot\nor Schneider's shot?
Wha--!
Heine, what'd ya think of Japan's #10?
He's better than I expected. Think he\nmight do okay on our team, even.
Maybe just okay.
(His technique is amazing, and his will to fight\nwas so strong. Wakabayashi did not exaggerate.)
(But that can't be the whole story.)
(I guess we'll find out in time.)
Hey, by the way Schneider, what about\nthat other guy that came in midmatch?
You mean #23?
Yeah.
He did pretty well pushing upfield.\nProbably oughta ask Kaltz what he thinks,\nthe kid blew right by him.
Shooting skills aside, he's got the fire in his\neyes. It was impressive that he got in a goal with\nhow the match was going.
He really stepped up the defense\nafter halftime, too. He's got talent.
But if that's all he's got, I'm not sure if we\nneed to be concerned.
I don't know. I didn't see any crazy moves,\nbut something's different about him...
...
Juan Diaz, Argentina Junior Youth
Well...
Karl Heinz Schneider!
Alan Pascal, Argentina Junior Youth
Diaz!
Hey, Pascal!
What impression did you get of Germany?
Well, I guess a few of 'em had some good moves.
But they're nowhere near our level!
If that's the case, then I\nguess it's gonna be us and--
Yep, us and Brazil.
And you know, they've got the legend...
...Just wait. We're still gonna beat 'em!
Ismail Senghor, Senegal Junior Youth
Hey... You know it's uhhh...
Huh?
It's not very safe to be up that high.\nYou could fall!
It's fine! Aaand... I'm down!
Łoł!
Hey, you're playing in the tourney too, yeah?
Ah, yes...
Lookin' forward to seein' ya on the pitch. Later!
Man, I wish I could do that...
A few hours after the scrimmage\nbetween Japan and Germany...
...
...
...
Okay boys, the scrimmage between\nGermany and Italy is about to begin.
Pay special attention to Italy\nhere. They're going to be our\nfirst opponents in the tournament.
...Right.
Guys...
...
Looks like Germany isn't fielding\neither Schneider or Heine.
Betcha they're still trying different things out\nbefore the real matches.
So you're saying we got our butts handed to us\neven without them at their best...?
Shhh, it's starting.
Darn...
This goalie's not half bad!
Heh.
That's crazy! He stopped that shot so easily...
Katagiri! Who is this keeper?!
Zino Hernandez. Due to his skill, he's already\nbeing scouted by pro teams in Italy.
Their defense has gotten careless!\nNow's our chance!
Here!
Ha! Then I guess I'm up!
Who's Italy's #10?
Leonardo Rusciano.\nHe's a forward on a team from southern Italy.
I'll stop him!
Outta my way!
What the--?! He got past me!
Bring it on, small fries! I'll take you all on!\nIt's time someone put you in your place!
Just who is this guy?
Our defenders may as well be standing still!
Hope you're ready! Eat this!
Nice shot, Rusciano!
And you're supposed to be the\nfavorites to win? What a joke!
H-He just outplayed the entire German\nteam by himself... And scored!
Hey, Misugi, wasn't that shot an awful lot\nlike your signature one from back in the day?
No, his was far superior.
I can't even imagine what kind of body or\nskill he has to have to give a low-angle\nvolley shot such a sharp rotation.
Off the field though, he has problems\nworking with his teammates, so he hasn't\nbeen picked up by any teams yet.
But as you can see, he stands out\neven among the other Italian players.
If Italy picked him for this despite his\nflaws, that just goes to show how\nserious they are about winning.
Well... We lost.
Eh, we were missing our best players. We'll just\nhave to pay 'em back come tournament time.
(Leonardo Rusciano... Zino Hernandez... We'll\nget you back in the real thing. You'll see!)
2-0, huh? Nice work, guys.
Wooo!



If we can keep this up, I know our team\ncan play even better when it counts.
Team? Is that a joke?
By the way, Rusciano, why'd you\nstop trying partway through?
You could've scored way more goals\non Germany with their aces out.
We won, didn't we? I just didn't feel like it.
It's not like I'll get some big offer from a team\njust for playing well in a scrim.
...
N-No way... Germany gave us so much trouble,\nand now Italy's making them look like amateurs!
Italy's THIS good?
Do we even stand a chance?
...
We already got trounced by\nboth America and Germany.
Maybe we're just not ready to take on the world.
Yeah... They're just stronger and better\nthan us. How could we ever win?
Guess we just can't compete in real soccer...
Seriously. Maybe we should just withdraw and head\nback to Japan before we embarrass ourselves.
S-Soda?
The heck's your problem?!
I can't believe you'd say that!\nTake that back!
Get off my back! It's true, ain't it?
You're ready to quit before the first kick?!
D-Don't fight guys...
We just have to play as hard as we can!
Yeah, <avatar_name>'s right!
I mean, you're not the type to run\naway without trying, are you Soda?!
You trying to call me a coward?!
I'm just stating the facts!
Don't get cocky just 'cause you\ngot to play a little, shrimp!
Who cares how hard we try?\nIt's all the same if we lose!
And it ain't just losing! We got\nstraight up destroyed here!
What's the point in competing at all when\nwe don't got a hope of winning?
That's enough, you guys!
Wha--!
Matsuyama...
Since when are you such a coward, Soda?
I-I'm no coward!
Wanting to go home because you're scared\nof being embarrassed is just running away.\nSo please explain how you aren't a coward.
Matsuyama!
And the same goes for the rest of you!\nDid you all turn into wimps over a few losses?
These last two matches taught us a lot about\nwhat international soccer is really like.
So we need to take what we've learned\nand put it to good use. Am I wrong?!
He's right, guys.
If we work hard and unite our strength,\nwe can be even better.
We're just gettin' started.
Matsuyama... Tsubasa...
Tch.
You never change, Tsubasa.\nYou're shining as bright as ever.
Huh?
Yeah, I don't think he can turn it off.
It's nice to have an optimist around.
...
Ummm, Hyuga?
Yeah? What's up?
Ya know that package I got from that caretaker\nearlier? Coach Kira sent you something.
He did? What is it?
I-Is this--?!
Two games. Two losses.\nSo far, this is about what we expected.
The rest will be up to them.
Mikami...
What is it?
Was this really the best way?
Shouldn't we have given them a better idea about\nthe American and German players they'd be up\nagainst, so they could strategize?
...
True, if we'd done that they would\nhave stood a better chance.
But they needed a real shock to get them in gear.
They needed to feel just how far they have to go.\nThey needed to feel it down to their bones.
I wanted them to find the strength to get back up\nwhen all feels lost. Without that, they'd never be\nready to take on the world.
I understand your motivations.
But even so, the American and German\nteams were far better than anticipated.
And our players are even more distraught than we\nthought they'd be. At this rate, the whole team\ncould collapse on itself.
If it comes to that...
Then they were never going\nto be the team we needed.
Mikami...!
Don't worry, Katagiri. Keep the faith.\nBelieve in them, as you always have.
You've known them longer than anyone, haven't you?
...Right.
Please excuse me while I take this call.
Yes? Hello?
Yo! Sorry to bug you so late...
But could you practice with me for a bit?
Whew! Figures... If we want to\nkeep up with the world, we'll\nneed to dribble at least this fast.
Especially if we get more surprises like today...\nIn order to keep up, we hafta explode like\nrunners coming off their blocks.
And let's see... There was that amazing long shot.
Hey, you were at the last two games.\nHow do you think we stack up to their players?
I don't think there's a significant gap.
It felt like they're out of our league.
What do you think, Captain?
I see. So you're confident.
Yeah, the results certainly made it feel that way.
Me?
To be perfectly honest, they're\nfar, far better than I expected.
They're faster, more skilled, bigger...\nAs it is, we don't stand a chance. The\nrest of the team's losing confidence too.
But we can't just accept this as the\nway things are and keep losing.
We were chosen to represent Japan.\nAnd the whole country's watching us.\nI'll admit, I think we may've been a bit cocky.
In order to catch up in this new arena,\nin order to pull the team back together...
All someone like me can do is keep training.\nI don't have the same raw talent the others do.
Hmmm? Who's that?
Oh! It's Misugi and Hyuga!
I was wondering who was out here. So it's you two?
Well aren't you fired up?\nTraining so late at night.
I could say the same of you.
Personally, I've more or less shaken off\nthe fatigue from the Junior Hero League.
So I figured if I want to ramp up my training for\nthe real thing, it's about time to get moving.
I need to think about the team formation, too.\nThere's still another scrimmage ahead of us.
Oh, you're also our acting coach now?\nThat's really impressive.
Oh, not at all...
Hey Hyuga, what's that black ball you're holding?
Ah, yeah, this is something my teacher gave me\nback in elementary school. It's three times\nheavier than a regular soccer ball.
I was gonna try strengthening up my legs\nand bring some more power to the Tiger Shot.
Oh...
Basically, we were all thinking the same thing.
Sounds about right.
It's not just us though.
Huh?
Look, someone else is coming.
Hey. Sorry, it's so late.
But would you mind joining me for a bit?
Since we got to America, I've been\nfocused on shaking off the fatigue\nfrom the Junior Hero League.
But now it's more or less gone.
So I figured if I want to ramp up my training for\nthe real thing, it's about time to get moving.
Plus... I wanted to ask you something.
You saw those last two games. How do\nyou see the gap between us and them?
I don't feel much of one.
I never even imagined it could be so big.
What do you think, Captain?
For you personally? Maybe not.
But what matters is the team.
Yeah, I hear that.
Even though we worked so hard back\nhome, I've come to realize that we\nwere just big fish in a small pond.
Do you always respond to a\nquestion with a question? Well...
From what I can tell, they're one or two steps\nahead of us in technique, speed, and power.
But if it were only that, we could make\nup for it in individual effort or tactics.
The real problem is that\nwe've all lost some heart.
It's about mentality. We can't play our best like\nthis. We're already defeated in our minds.
But there's still time. We need to find\na way to get everyone back on their\nfeet before the tournament.
For example, what if those of us\nwho still have some hope could\nmodel how we maintain confidence?
It would at least give them a way to keep from\nbeing shaken by the other teams.
If everyone can keep calm in the face of\nadversity, that should give us something\nto build on and play our best.
We have the talent. So if we can help them find\nthe motivation, they'll train, and then the rest\nwill follow. I'm sure of it.
The problem is making the "model."
Huh? Who's there?
Oh, it's Hyuga and Matsuyama!
I could barely see you two in the dark out here.
Are you going to be alright\npracticing so late, Misugi?
Don't worry, I'll take care of myself. I want\nto play in the tournament, too, you know.
Alright, if you say so.
But anyway... What'd you two\ncome all the way out here for?
What do you think? Practice. I'm sure we've got\neven more surprises in store for us, so I figured\nI'd squeeze in some sprints.
We gotta rebuild ourselves.\nStart from the ground up.
I mean, that's what I told everyone,\nso it's time to follow through.
I see. Good to see you haven't changed.
Hey Hyuga, what's that black ball you're holding?
Ah, yeah, this is something my teacher gave me\nback in elementary school. It's three times\nheavier than a regular soccer ball.
I was gonna try strengthening up my legs\nand bring some more power to the Tiger Shot.
Oh...
So basically, we were all thinking the same thing.
Uh-huh.
It's not just us though.
Huh?
See, look over there.
Sorry, it's so late.
But could you train with me for a bit?
Hey, you were at the last two games.\nHow do you think we stack up to their players?
Felt about even to me.
I feel like... Their ability is beyond me.
What do you think, Captain?
Cocky, huh?
Takeshi's like that too...\nWhoops, ya didn't hear that from me.
Yeah, that's normal.
Hey, I'm the one asking the question. But fine.
I'll give it to ya straight. I thought\nI'd be able to take on the world\nright away. I think we all did.
But after seeing 'em up close, now it's clear...\nThese guys're stronger, faster, BETTER than us.\nAnd it's killed everyone's confidence.
Even I was pretty shocked. There was a\nmoment in that game that really tore me up.
But I got over it. If they can\nplay like that, why can't we?
So I wanna find how to share that with\nthe others who are feeling beat up.
And to do that... I'm gonna use\nthis ball Coach Kira sent me.
Hyah!
This black ball is three times heavier\nthan a normal soccer ball.
With this, I'm gonna train up my legs\nso they're stronger than ever!
And then...
Which is better, my Tiger Shot\nor Schneider's shot?
Uhhh...
I'd have to say Schneider's.\nIt's just more polished. Sorry.
You think? Good to know.
Huh?
If there are guys out there who can shoot better\nthan me, that just means I've got room to grow.
I'll train even more to catch up with\nSchneider, and then I'll surpass him!
I'll call my new shot the Neo Tiger Shot!\nI'll be the best striker the world has ever seen!
(Figures this extra heavy ball\nwould be crazy tough on my legs.)
(But I gotta keep pushing until\nI can kick it like a normal ball!)
Hmmm? Who's there?
Matsuyama! Misugi!
I was wondering who'd be out here\nat this hour. So it was you all.
We heard a massive thud. Are you\ngoing to be alright kicking a ball like that?
Don't worry about me. What about you\nguys? What're you doing out here?
Training, of course. I'm sure we've\ngot more surprises in store for us,\nso I'm focusing on my speed.
We gotta rebuild ourselves.\nStart from the ground up.
I mean, that's what I told everyone,\nso it's time to follow through.
I'm gonna get running.
I've more or less shaken off\nthe fatigue from the Junior Hero League.
So I figured if I want to ramp up my training for\nthe real thing, it's about time to get moving.
I need to think about the team formation, too.\nThere's still another scrimmage ahead of us.
Formation? I think I'm just\ngonna leave that to you.
Guess we're all thinking the same thing, huh?
Yeah, sounds like it.
But we're not the only ones.
Hmmm?
Look, someone else is coming.
(The world's a big place after all.)
(It's only been a few days since we got\nhere, and we've met one amazing player\nafter another, including Schneider.)
(If I want to be the world's best player and\nfulfill my dreams, I've got to take my next\nstep as a player.)
(And then I'll beat them!)
Tsubasa!
What?
What are all you guys doing out here this late?
I'd bet it's the same reason you're here, Tsubasa.
Huh?
Well, you know how it is.
There's only one thing we could\nall be thinking, isn't there?
Yeah, I guess so.
We all want the same thing...
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!
To win the Junior Youth World Challenge!





I mean we're talking about us,\nright? I know we can do it.
No doubt!
Ummm... Could I join the circle too?
!


It's you!
It can't be...!
Been awhile, Tsubasa.\nAnd everyone else too, of course.
I knew you'd come, Misaki!
It's Misaki!
Yo.
I've been waiting to see you for so long!
Sorry for not being able to\nstay in touch, Tsubasa.
It doesn't matter!\nAll that matters is that you're here, now!
So when'd you arrive in America, Misaki?
Just now. Mr. Katagiri came\nto pick me up at the airport.
Still, it's like no one's changed.\nI recognized everyone almost immediately.\nStill being "friends with the ball," right?
You haven't changed much yourself, either.
I guess so.
Hey, so if you're here, then does that mean...?
Yeah, I'm representing Japan, too.
F-For real?!
It wasn't an easy decision, but in\nthe end I couldn't pass up a chance\nto play with you guys again.
I hope I won't be in the way,\nbut I'm truly glad to be here.
Don't worry about it! I know you'll do fine!
We need to work hard and\nresurrect the Golden Duo!
Definitely. Thanks, Tsubasa.
By the way, I don't think we've met?
Oh yeah, he's one of the younger kids\nfrom Furano. Go on, introduce yourself.
Oh, right, you wouldn't know him, Misaki.\nC'mon, introduce yourself.
He's from my school. C'mon, introduce yourself.
I'm <avatar_name>.
Your reputation precedes you.\nI'm <avatar_name>.
I'm the young soccer prodigy.
I'm Taro Misaki.\nNice to meet you, <avatar_name>.
My pleasure. I'm Taro Misaki.\nNice to meet you, <avatar_name>.
Wh-What confidence...
I'm Taro Misaki.\nNice to meet you, <avatar_name>.
Alright, now let's all get back to practice!
Tak!
You too, Misaki! Let's kick the\nball around like old times!
I'd love to, but...
In order to officially join the team, the Japan\nSoccer Association has all these formalities I\nhave to deal with.
So, sorry. I can't just yet.
Oh, okay...
But once everything's taken care of, I should be\nable to join in tomorrow. See you then!
Sure! Tomorrow it is! I can't wait!
Me neither! Later!
...
(Tsubasa and Misaki led Nankatsu SC to the\nchampionship together, back in elementary school.\nAnd now they're finally together again.)
(As long as they can play like they\ndid back then... Or maybe even...)
The following morning.\nJapan Junior Youth Practice Field.
I'm Taro Misaki, and I'll be joining\nthe team today! I hope I can help!
Hey! It's been a bit.
How've you been?
Huh, you look the same... Maybe a little taller.
Like we're any different.
Hahaha!




Yo, first timer here. Good ta meetcha.
Yeah, so you're the famous Misaki, huh?
Okay guys, the next scrimmage is\ncoming up soon, so let's get started!
Yes, Coach!




We'll split into pairs, and you'll\ntrade passes until you're ready\nto shoot! Goalies, get in position!
Yes, Coach!


Alright, first up are... Tsubasa and Misaki!
Y-Yes, Sir!
(Tsubasa...)
(Misaki...)
It's time for their famous combo play to\nreturn to the stage, after three long years.
Can they still sync up like they used to?
(C'mon you two, I know you can do it...)
Here we go, Misaki!
Tak!
Hey, look at that!
Even after three years, they're\nstill on the same wavelength!
Crazy!
Even at that speed, their passing is perfect!
No duh! Did you think the Golden Duo was\nsomething we called them sarcastically?
And here they are! Together again!
One last pass, Misaki!
Gotcha!
Ooof!
Nice shot!
Nice pass!
You two still got it!
Passing at that speed, and that\nshot... Looks like Misaki's improved\na lot these past three years.
I'm impressed, Tsubasa.\nI could barely keep up with you!
That's what I was about to say!
Alright, <avatar_name>,\nlet's get fired up too!
We won't let Tsubasa and Misaki be the only stars!
Let's nail this together!
Give it all ya got!
Yeah, that's the spirit!
I was thinking the same thing!
I always do!
We're not gonna let those two leave us in\nthe dust, are we? Let's do this, guys!
Tak!




Excuse me, Coach? Can we talk?
Hmmm? What is it?
I'd like Tsubasa and Misaki to be\nin the starting line-up next match.
Misaki just joined though. I was\nthinking of having him watch the\nnext match to see where we are.
But I would like to hear your reasoning.\nCan you tell me why?
...I see. You're right, with those two together\nwe can make the match about the midfield and\npatch up some of the team's weaknesses.
There's also another reason.
After realizing the gap between us and the other\nteams, a lot of the players lost their confidence.\nI think this might give it back to them.
...
If Tsubasa and Misaki's combo can be the model\nfor how we can take on the international teams,\nthe other players can stay calm and just play.
Maybe we can even find a way to build our own\nrhythm, and then I think we'll all start believing\nwe can win again.
If we think we can win, then we can\nplay our best. And if we can play our\nbest, we can put up a good fight.
Are you really only in middle school?
I understand you exactly.\nWe'll execute your plan next match.
Thank you, Sir!
Actually, there is one other thing\nI've decided on for the next match.
What's that?
I'm putting <avatar_name>\nin the starting line-up.
Huh?
From what I can tell, he's a prodigy on the\nsame level as Tsubasa and the others.
I don't think we've seen his full potential.
He still has a lot of room to grow, and\nI think that will impress the rest of the\nteam. And that will benefit everyone.
The way I see it, he'll be the key to\nunlocking the potential of the team.
Maybe you're right...
(What about <avatar_name> though?)
(He's definitely got the talent.\nSo if I just give him the chance,\nI'm sure he won't disappoint.)
Listen up, everyone.
After the games so far, I'm sure you realize the\nextent of the challenges you now face.
So with that in mind, this match we'll\nbe trying out a new formation.
First, Matsuyama.
Yes?
In the last match with Germany, our defensive\nplay improved after you joined the defenders.\nThat seriously helped out the whole team.
So today, I want you starting in\nthe back, leading the defenders.
Yessir!
Your midfield position will be taken over by\nMisaki. He'll be joining the starting line-up.
Huh?
I know you're new to the team, but your skills\nare the real deal. That was evident in practice.
Along with Tsubasa's support, you can turn\nit into a midfield game. I don't think there's\nanyone better suited to that task than you.
Y-Yessir! I'll do my best!
Don't worry, you'll do fine!
Yeah, let's do this, Tsubasa!
And finally...
I'm putting <avatar_name>\nin the starting line-up.
Yes, Coach! I won't let you down!
Me? In the starting line-up?!
Finally! Now's my time to shine!
Good. Try to experiment and\nfind what you're best at.
Yes, you. You were chosen to represent\nJapan, so show some confidence. And make\nsure not to forget it when you hit the field.
Well, at least I don't have to\nworry about you being timid.
Give it all you've got!
Today's opponents are from Uruguay, a\nSouth American country. They're a team\nwith speed and technique to spare.
But don't let that bother you. Winners overcome.
Don't let them set the pace.\nFind your own rhythm! Got it?
Yes, Coach!




(This'll be my first match against a team from\nSouth America. I've been dreaming of going there\nfor what feels like forever.)
(Will my own South American-style\nplay even work against them?)
(If it does, then it should work in Brazil too...)
So you're a starter today, huh?\nJust hearing that is making even ME nervous.
Listen, don't worry about playing well\nor showing off. Just play like you\npracticed. Play your own way.
We'll all be there to support you. So just\nbelieve in the team and give it your all!
Hey, congrats on making the starting\nline-up. Looks like you beat me to it.
If Coach chose you for the final scrimmage,\nthat means he's got high expectations.
But I know you can live up to them.\nSo go out there and show them who you are!
Sure, you're on the starting line-up,\nbut save the celebration.
We're on the same team, but we're still rivals.\nThe coach might switch you out at any moment.\nSame goes for me.
So remember, don't lose to your opponents,\nand don't lose to your teammates either!
We have an easy game today. Our opponents\nlost to Germany and even to the Americans.
Still, try not to get hurt out there. If you get\na shot, take it. And let's start building some\nmomentum for when we face real competition.
Alright guys, let's do this!
Let's school Japan on what real soccer is!
Tak!




Alright folks, today's the\nlast scrimmage for Japan.
The All-Japan team already lost their\nlast two matches against America\nand Germany fairly decisively.
And today they continue crashing right into the\nwall of international soccer. They're up against\nUruguay, a country that's won the World Cup.
Up against a team that leads the pack\neven in South America, Japan looks to\nbe switching up their formation.
What's this? Starting this match, Tsubasa's\nold partner-in-crime from elementary school\nhas joined the team! It's Taro Misaki!
With their old combo reborn, I hope these two\nwill show us some explosive play that can rebound\nthe Japanese going into the main tournament!
Still, I'm sure Uruguay wants to\nwin this, too, so they can go into\nthe tournament already fired up.
And now it's time for the kickoff!
Let's make this a good match, okay?
That depends on you, doesn't it?
You really think the likes of\nyou can keep up with us?
Just try not to lose sight of the ball.
(Jeez... Well, we know what they think of us.)
I get what you're feeling,\nTsubasa, but be careful.
Misaki...
We just need to do it like we practiced. As long\nas we play our own soccer, it'll all work out.
Yeah... You're right. Thanks.
Having you around really is reassuring.
Same here. Let's do this.
Yeah, let's show 'em what Japan's really got!
(It's been three years since\nwe played together...)
(It's been a long time since\nI've been this nervous.)
Here we go!
Yes we do!
Tak!
That's it! That's it!
Can't beat that Golden Duo!
Takeshi! We can't let Misaki \nand Tsubasa show us up!
Right, Hyuga!
How about OUR combo?!
Remember the name, punk!\nMakoto Soda! Ace Killer.
See what you get when you mess\nwith the best?
Witness true power! Y'see what\nI'm sayin'?
Time to send you packin'!
Leave the backfield to me!
Counting on you, Matsuyama!
Yahoo! I gotcha, baby!
Yo, Victorino! Beautiful, beautiful!
Astonishing! Japan gives up a goal to Victorino!
And the way he tore across the pitch, no wonder\nhe's called the "Black Panther of South America"!
Such blinding speed, and he doesn't seem to\nslow down. How is he able to keep that up...
Mr. Katagiri, who...
Unfortunately he's not in our database.\nBut it's hard to believe a player like that...
...Just means that the world's full of surprises.
And that's the first half!
The All-Japan team's new lineup strikes a\nblow and seizes the lead in the first half!
And that's the first half!
Despite new tactics, the All-Japan side\ncomes away empty-handed and fails\nto take the lead in the first half!
You're looking good out there, guys! Picking up a\nnice steady tempo on offense and defense!
And Uruguay's speed doesn't seem to be tripping\nyou up. Now keep it up in the second half!
Yes, Coach!




Hey, Misaki! Now the world's gotten\na good look at our combo strike!
Tak!
But I gotta tell ya, after three years it's hard\nto believe all the gears still turn so smooth.
You two were amazing!\nYou wrecked those Uruguay jerks!
You're not just the Nankatsu Golden Duo\nanymore. You're the All-Japan-- Nah,\nthe World Golden Duo!
That's a pretty lame name, not gonna lie.
Yo, shut up! No one asked you!
Takeshi! We've got some goals to score, buddy!\nCan't let the others hog all the glory!
Alright, Hyuga! Ready when you are!
(That Tsubasa-Misaki combination play\nhas really uplifted the team's spirits.)
(Guess Misugi had the right idea.)
(Putting Matsuyama back at defender has the\ndefense running smoother than before, as well.)
(Looks like all that's left is for\n<avatar_name> to step up...)
(I can't believe this! This team\njust can't get it together at all!)
(And that's cause they've got\nme locked up tight in the midfield,\nit's like I'm wading through tar!)
(And what's up with that #10? He's Japanese, but\nhe plays like he grew up in South America.)
(And his combination play with #11.\nI hate to admit it, but they outclassed\nus in passing and pure speed.)
(Is that some kinda secret weapon they've\nbeen sitting on the last two games?)
(Does that make us their guinea pigs?!)
(I can't believe it!)
Scrimmage or not... If we lose this, our\nhopes of winning the tournament are over!
Get your heads in the game!\nThe second half is ours for the taking!
Tak!




Man, even with Tsubasa and Misaki\nout there we're getting whupped...
We're just not good enough...
(This isn't good... The Misaki-Tsubasa combo\naside, morale's going down the toilet, if things\ndon't improve.)
(There's no way this team's going to\nhave a chance in the actual tournament\nwithout some serious adjustments.)
Chin up, guys! Sure, we're behind,\nbut we're playing a good game.
There's still plenty of time left on the clock.\nLet's hang tough in the second half!
Tsubasa...
Yeah, Tsubasa's right!
You serve me up those perfect\npasses, and I'll serve us up a win!
Make it happen, Kojiro!
Alright everybody, let's make it a good one!
Tak!




(Always with a winning attitude... Nankatsu\nCaptain Tsubasa Ozora... Impressive how you\ncan lift spirits so naturally.)
(And if you can pull this off, then this team is\ngoing to hit a whole new level of play.)
(If you want to grow and succeed, it's\ngoing to have to be by your own hands.)
(Give it all you've got, gentlemen.)
(Okay, now we're getting somewhere!\nThe team's really picking up a sweet rhythm.)
(But that #10 over there's still a threat with\nthose South American-style moves.)
(And that combo play with #11 has\ngot us definitely beat on speed.)
(But it's just a bunch of passing\naround. They can't win off that.)
Okay guys, let's keep up the offensive\ntempo in the second half!
Tak!




As we enter the second half, the\nAll-Japan team is finally showing some\nfangs with their lead over Uruguay.
Can they hold their ground and maintain\nmomentum as the battle heats up?
We're moments away from kickoff, folks!
The All-Japan team needs a win today,\nif they're going to gain any traction.
Look for them to come out swinging!
It's almost time for the second half.\nKickoff is only moments away!
Nice shot, Hyuga!
Yeah...
What's the matter, Hyuga?
(It's just not enough power! Not yet.)
(But I know it's there. I know I can\nget there before the tournament.)
Wahoo! I gotcha, baby!
Yo, Victorino! Wonderful!
And that's the match!
Fresh tactics from the All-Japan Junior Youth\nhave brought them their first\nvictory here on American soil!
Look for these boys to become serious\ncontenders after so much development\nover these last three scrimmages!
And that's the match!
Victory once again eludes\nthe All-Japan Junior Youth.
Just goes to show that the world\nof soccer isn't always so kind.
There's still the tournament ahead, but after\ntheir performances in these pre-matches, there's\nnot much hope to go around.
Yes! We did it! We got our first win!
Nice work, everybody! All-Japan soccer's\ngot a foothold worldwide now!
It means our hard work paid off. We've\ngotta keep pushing ourselves if we're\ngonna win this tournament!
Tak! Rockin' and sockin' 'em!
Heh, just one win and the\nwhole world's gone crazy.
Don't pretend you're not happy,\nSoda! I saw you smilin'!
Yo, shut up! My face is just like that, ya dork.
Misaki, looks like your French tour nabbed\nyou some nice skills. Your moves are way\nbetter on the pitch than when training.
That's some speed you've got out\nthere too, Tsubasa. Took me\neverything just to keep up with you.
Were it anyone else, I wouldn't\nhave the opportunity.
I appreciate it.
...But I was worried at the start, you know.
I figured I might just drag you guys down.
But I'm happy it all worked out.\nThis team is awesome.
(You all were fantastic. It's like you're not\neven the same team from the last two games.)
(We've got Matsuyama holding up the defense,\nTsubasa running the midfield, and Hyuga up front.)
(Add Misaki as a little extra string to tie it\nall together... We really have something here.)
(And <avatar_name> really\nshowed up today, just like I'd hoped.)
(He may be the final piece\nof the puzzle that we need.)
(But <avatar_name> still\nneeds to flex those muscles some more.)
(Once he reaches his full potential,\nthen maybe the team will be complete.)
Jeez! How the heck did we lose to THESE guys?!
Victorino, good game today. Thank you.
You had some incredible speed out there.\nI was surprised to see somebody run that fast.
...It was just a scrimmage. Wait\nuntil you see me in a real game.
I look forward to it. Let's\neach play to our fullest.
Hey, hold up a sec!
Yeah?
You play like a South American.\nWhere'd you learn to do that?
Ah, yeah... The man who taught\nme how to play was from Brazil.
That explains it.
I've got a lot of love for South America.\nI'm glad I got to play you guys today.
Catch ya later!
Hmph...
(I'll get you back come tournament time!)
Listen up, everyone.
Now that you've come this far, I imagine you all\nhave some idea of what you're truly up against.
So with that in mind, this match we'll\nbe trying out a new formation.
First up, Matsuyama.
Yes, Sir.
In the last match with Germany, our defensive\nplay improved after you joined the defenders.\nThat seriously helped out the whole team.
So today, I want you starting in\nthe back, leading the defenders.
Got it!
Your midfield position will be taken over by\nMisaki. He'll be joining the starting line-up.
Huh?
I know you're new to the team, but your skills\nare the real deal. That was evident in practice.
Along with Tsubasa's support, you can turn\nit into a midfield game. I don't think there's\nanyone better suited to that task than you.
Yes, Coach! I won't let you down!
Don't worry, you'll do fine!
Yeah, let's do this, Tsubasa!
And finally...
I'm putting <avatar_name>\nin the starting line-up.
Yes, Coach! I'll do my best!
Me? In the starting line-up?!
Finally! Now's my time to shine!
Good. Try to experiment and\nfind what you're best at.
Yes, you. You were chosen to represent Japan,\nso show some confidence. And make sure\nnot to forget it when you hit the field.
Well, at least I don't have to\nworry about you being timid.
I'm expecting 100% out of you!
You're taking on England today, captained by\nRobson playing defender. They're going to push\nhard and fast, so look out.
That means they're gonna play a lot like Italy.\nWho we came up against first.
You're gonna get a close look at the\nEuropean counter today. Learn the\ntempo and prepare for the real thing!
Yes, Coach!




Starting today, huh <avatar_name>?\nDunno why but it makes me nervous.
Listen, don't worry about playing well\nor showing off. Just play like you\npracticed. Play your own way.
We'll all be there to support you. So just\nbelieve in the team and give it your all!
Hey, congrats on making the starting line-up,\n<avatar_name>. Looks like you beat me to it.
If Coach chose you for the final scrimmage,\nthat means he's got high expectations.
But I know you can live up to them.\nSo go out there and show them who you are!
Sure, you're on the starting line-up,\nbut save the celebration.
We're on the same team, but we're still rivals.\nThe coach might switch you out at any moment.\nSame goes for me.
So remember, don't lose to your opponents,\nand don't lose to your teammates either!
Okay, we're up against a losing team.\nIt'll be a good time for us to pace ourselves.
Time for the home of soccer to\nprovide some educational outreach.
Team! Wipe the floor with them. Make Germany look\nlike they got off easy. And let's show the world\nwhat they're up against in the tournament!
Okay!





Alright folks, today's the\nlast scrimmage for Japan.
The All-Japan team already lost their\nlast two matches against America\nand Germany fairly decisively.
And today they continue crashing right into the\nwall of international soccer. They face England,\nbirthplace of the game itself.
The All-Japan players will be switching it up\nwith a new formation against the formidable\nEnglishmen, commanded by Robson.
What's this? Starting this match, Tsubasa's\nold partner-in-crime from elementary school\nhas joined the team! It's Taro Misaki!
With their old combo reborn, I hope these two\nwill show us some explosive play that can rebound\nthe Japanese going into the main tournament!
Naturally, England will want a win to kickoff the\ntournament on a confident note.
Will it be England, or Japan? It's time to find\nout as we get ready for the kickoff!
Let's make this a good match, okay?
Yes, let's.
Eh, I guess this is a good opportunity for you\nfellas to pick up some pointers, courtesy of a\nlegendary soccer dynasty.
Just don't try to bruise us up.
(Is this guy going to shut up?)
I get what you're feeling,\nTsubasa, but be careful.
Misaki...
We just need to do it like we practiced. As long\nas we play our own soccer, it'll all work out.
You're right. Thanks.
Having you around really is reassuring.
Same here. Let's do this.
Yeah, let's show 'em what Japan's really got!
(It's been three years since\nwe played together...)
(It's been a long time since\nI've been this nervous.)
Here we go!
Yes we do!
Tak!
That's it! That's it!
Can't beat that Golden Duo!
Takeshi! We can't let Misaki\nand Tsubasa show us up!
Alright, Hyuga! Ready when you\nare!
How about OUR combo?!
Wha--? How'd you get past me?!
Gah! How is international\nsoccer this hard?!
Leave the backfield to me!
Counting on you, Matsuyama!
And that's the half!
The All-Japan team's new lineup strikes a\nblow and seizes the lead in the first half!
And that's the first half!
Despite new tactics, the All-Japan side\ncomes away empty-handed and fails\nto take the lead in the first half!
You're looking good out there, guys! Picking up a\nnice steady tempo on offense and defense!\nKeep it up in the second half!
Yes, Coach!




Hey, Misaki! Now the world's gotten\na good look at our combo strike!
Tak!
But I gotta tell ya, after three years it's hard\nto believe all the gears still turn so smooth.
You two were amazing!\nYou really wrecked those English jerks!
You're not just the Nankatsu Golden Duo\nanymore. You're the All-Japan-- Nah,\nthe World Golden Duo!
That's a pretty lame name, not gonna lie.
Yo, shut up! No one asked you!
Takeshi! We've got some goals to score, buddy!\nCan't let the others hog all the glory!
Racja! Let's do it, Hyuga!
(That Tsubasa-Misaki combination play\nhas really uplifted the team's spirits.)
(Guess Misugi had the right idea.)
(Putting Matsuyama back at defender has the\ndefense running smoother than before, as well.)
(Looks like all that's left is for\n<avatar_name> to step up...)
(This can't be happening!\nWho knew Japan was this good?!)
(How could we be so full of ourselves...\nJapan is so much better than I thought.)
(The passing plays between #10 and #11 were\nastounding... How did Japan develop such speed?)
(The Americans and Germans\ndidn't have anyone like those two.)
(And that is keeping us tied\nup in knots in the midfield!)
(But no way we're going down today.\nI don't care if it's just a scrimmage!)
Okay, all. We've still got half a match to play.
Let's show some pride and some unity as the home\nof soccer out there in the second half!
Aye!





Man, even with Tsubasa and Misaki\nout there we're getting whupped...
We're just not good enough...
(This isn't good... The Misaki-Tsubasa combo\naside, morale's going down the toilet, if things\ndon't improve.)
(There's no way this team's going to\nhave a chance in the actual tournament\nwithout some serious adjustments.)
Chin up, guys! Sure, we're behind,\nbut we're playing a good game.
There's still plenty of time left on the clock.\nLet's hang tough in the second half!
Tsubasa...
Yeah, Tsubasa's right!
You serve me up those perfect\npasses, and I'll serve us up a win!
Make it happen, Kojiro!
Alright everybody, let's make it a good one!
Okay!




(Always with a winning attitude... Nankatsu\nCaptain Tsubasa Ozora... Impressive how you\ncan lift spirits so naturally.)
(And if you can pull this off, then this team is\ngoing to hit a whole new level of play.)
(Young people grow by their own hands.)
(Give it all you've got, gentlemen.)
(Smooth sailing for merry England today, boys.)
(And what a shame about Japan...\nThird-tier skills from a third-tier country.)
(But #10 and #11... We'll have to watch those\ntwo. Their passing plays could still be bad news.)
(It's not every day you see a combo that\npotent, even from the European teams.)
(Nevertheless, it's time we shut them down!)
Okay, all. We've still got half a match\nto play. No mercy, no mistakes.
Today, and every day, remember this: "Even\nwhen hunting rabbits, lions don't hold back!"
That's right!





As we enter the second half, the\nAll-Japan team is finally showing some\nfangs with their lead over Uruguay.
Can they hold their ground and maintain\nmomentum as the battle heats up?
We're moments away from kickoff, folks!
The All-Japan team needs a win today,\nif they're going to gain any traction.
Look for them to come out swinging!
It's almost time for the second half.\nKickoff is only moments away!
(Hmph! That's one banger of a\nshot!)
(It's just not enough power!\nNot yet.)
And that's the match!
Fresh tactics from the All-Japan Junior Youth\nhave brought them their first\nvictory here on American soil!
Look for these boys to become serious\ncontenders after so much development\nover these last three scrimmages!
And that's the match!
Victory once again eludes\nthe All-Japan Junior Youth.
It's a tough world out there.
There's still the tournament ahead, but after\ntheir performances in these pre-matches, there's\nnot much hope to go around.
Yes! We did it! We got our first win!
Nice work, everybody! All-Japan soccer's\ngot a foothold worldwide now!
It means our hard work paid off. We've\ngotta keep pushing ourselves if we're\ngonna win this tournament!
Tak! Rockin' and sockin' 'em!
Heh, just one win and the\nwhole world's gone crazy.
Don't pretend you're not happy,\nSoda! I saw you smilin'!
Yo, shut up! My face is just like that, ya dork.
Misaki, looks like your French tour nabbed\nyou some nice skills. Your moves are way\nbetter on the pitch than when training.
That's some speed you've got out\nthere too, Tsubasa. Took me\neverything just to keep up with you.
Were it anyone else, I wouldn't\nhave the opportunity.
I appreciate it.
...But I was worried at the start, you know.
I figured I was gonna just drag you guys down.
But I'm happy it all worked out.\nThis team is awesome.
(You all were fantastic. It's like you're not\neven the same team from the last two games.)
(We've got Matsuyama holding up the defense,\nTsubasa running the midfield, and Hyuga up front.)
(Add Misaki as a little extra string to tie it\nall together... We really have something here.)
(And <avatar_name> really\nshowed up today, just like I'd hoped.)
(He may be the final piece\nof the puzzle that we need.)
(But <avatar_name> still\nneeds to flex those muscles some more.)
(Once he reaches his full potential,\nthen maybe the team will be complete.)
Tsubasa, I'm sorry about before.\nLooks like I may have judged you unduly.
It was a fine match, and a gut check for England.
I'm honored to have had the opportunity to go\ntoe-to-toe with the originators of the sport.
You taught me how deep the European\nsoccer river runs. That means a lot.
I'm pleased to hear that.
Best of luck to you in the tournament!
You too!
(It's clear to me now. We only had half a game\ntogether, but it's like crystal.)
(Now I see the skill of Tsubasa Ozora,\na real Japanese ace.)
So Schneider, whaddya think of Japan?
They're not ready for us yet.
But they could be. It all depends on Tsubasa.
Good for you, you figured it out.
And I'm glad I did. Now I see that Japan could\nstand in the way of our aspirations.
Mmhmmm, they're going to try. Wait and see.
Hey everybody, I've got someone who\nwants to see you! Come on in, man!
It's...!
Heeey, it's Wakabayashi!
Hey fellas, it's been awhile.
"Awhile"?! It's been three years, that's not just\n"awhile"! It's been a crazy long time!
Captain, you're gettin' tall!
Hey, we're not at Shutetsu ES anymore,\nknock it off with the "Captain" stuff.
He finally got his contract problem\nfigured out and he's gonna be back\nwith the team, starting today!
That's right, and I'm looking forward\nto playing with you guys again.
Niiice! With Wakabayashi back on board,\nain't nothin's gonna stand in our way!
Think you might be getting ahead\nof yourself there, Ishizaki?
No... What?
I've been taking a good, long look at replays\nfrom your scrims. And I was there today.
Tell you the truth, you guys have got a long way\nto go before you're ready to take on the world.
Hey, what now?
Jeez, Wakabayashi...
Your passing and shooting isn't precise enough.\nYour defenders aren't checking opponents hard\nenough. And your teamwork needs more teamwork!
You did well out there today, but that was just a\nscrimmage. Don't think you can pull the same\non the field during a real game!
Hey! Yeah, okay, you played for some big\nhoity-toity international club, but you're lettin'\nit get to your head, dude!
Ya best shut yer mouth\nbefore I get mad, lil' fishie.
...Guys, I think Wakabayashi's right.
Not you too, Misaki!
I saw the kind of soccer they play in\nFrance. When it comes to the real thing,\nthey come out swinging a lot harder.
If these two say they've been there and\nseen it, I think we better believe them.
...
...
Where you going, Hyuga?
To train, what else?
If we're not on their level, we need\nto get on their level. Simple as that.
I'm with Hyuga! We need to make the most\nof our time before the real games begin!
Okay guys. All or nothing!\nLet's give it everything we've got!
Tak! Like we're gonna let a little, old thing\nlike the world stand in our way!
Pick a drill. I'll do it a thousand times!
Come on, Tachibana boys!\nWe got some trainin' ta do.
I know exactly what we need to do.
Great, let's get to it!
Hey, Takeshi! <avatar_name>!
Uh, yeah Soda...?
...I'm sorry about before.
Huh?
I just, you know... I got mad about losin' and\nblurted out somethin' I didn't mean.
But in the end, I do have your back.\nWe're All-Japan, y'know?
We're a team. Let's play like one!
Heh... Well, at least you figured that out.
Yeah, let's do it. No more mean stuff outta me.
...Little cocky brat, aren't ya?
I guess back when I was a second year\nI blamed a lotta stuff on other folks too.
Well, that's the long and\nshort of it. See ya around.
Soda...
<avatar_name>,\nI'm gonna train with the team. You?
I'd like to work on my combo plays.
I'd like to build my skills with some solo work.
Me? I don't need to practice!
Okay! Then let's get to it.
Hmmm, okay. Looks like you've really\ngot your own groove going on.
You've got amazing potential. Don't hold back!
...
I guess you can do what you want\nnow that you're an All-Japan player.
See ya.
<avatar_name>, I'm thinking of doing some data\nanalysis of the teams we'll be facing in the\ntournament.
What will you be doing?
I'm gonna work on some combo plays.
I'm going to build my skills with some solo work.
True talent needs only inspiration, and some fun!
Yeah, that's a fine idea, those plays\nare the very heart of our team.
Hmmm. I suppose there are things\nyou can only discover on your own.
Well then, good luck!
...
You're a big-leaguer now. If that's what you\nwanna do, who am I to tell you otherwise?
See ya later.
<avatar_name>, I'm gonna go train with\nWakashimazu. What're you gonna do?
Gotta practice, observe, and learn.
I'm going to go it alone, I need\nto figure out my own thing.
You guys go have fun.
Yeah, that's smart. You're playing with\nthe national team, after all. Everybody's\nat the top of their game.
Play smart! Play hard!
Seeking to know yourself, huh?\nYou're like some kinda samurai.
It's important to take time out for that.\nMay you emerge a stronger man!
"Go have fun"? You gonna just goof off?!
...Whatever. Let's go, Wakashimazu.
Uh, yeah...
I figured you all would buckle when I broke the\nnews, but you're a tough bunch going right out\nthere to train.
Maybe pissing you off's got some value to it.
So you were just messing with us?
I'll be the bad guy if it'll make the team\nstronger... No skin off my nose.
But I wasn't lying. You guys\nhave come a long way...
...But the world's a lot harsher place than\neven you already realize, Tsubasa.
Y-Yeah, I guess.
And you're the one who has\nto bind this team together.
It’s on you, Tsubasa!
Yeah, you can count on me.
We're gonna shoot straight for the top!
Yeah, that's it! That's the right attitude!
And hey, by the way...
Hmmm?
Think you're up for a little one-on-one?
You never change, Tsubasa.
I'm game. I've been waiting for this!
Not one goal, Tsubasa. Not one!
Oh, we'll see about that!
Louis Napoleon, France Junior Youth
Looks like we're last to turn in for the night.
Elle Sid Pierre, Captain, France Junior Youth
Well, getting ourselves properly ready.
A tournament that WE should've hosted.\nBut no, the International Junior Youth Tournament\nwas stolen from us.
We will repay that insult!
D'accord!
Jean, France Junior Youth
That's what we're here for.
Don't you worry, just sit back and watch\nme put in a hat trick every match!
Backfield's good. I'll hold 'em at nil.
We aren't here just to win a game or two.\nWe're here to take home a perfect record!
Sure!
Tak!


Hello, Father?
Karl, what is it?
The tournament's starting tomorrow.\nI just wanted to call...
Ah, yes. Seems it's almost\ntime for the opening act.
Karl, victory is yours if\nyou want it. Do your best.
Thanks, Dad.
But I wanted to talk about us.
...
It's been a really long time since you and Mom\nstopped living together, hasn't it, Dad?
Dad, please... Just please, even if it's just for\nMarie and me... Please try talking to Mom again?
The two of us, we just...
Oh, speaking of which... I heard you\nmoved over to Bayern from Hamburg?
Dad!
The coach, Felster, was once my rival many years\nago. He'll make you a fine soccer player.
But...!
You're an upstanding young\nman, Karl. You'll be fine.
Good luck in the tournament, Son.
Dad...
(Dad... I'm going to win this tournament for you.)
(I'm going to show the world you were\nright about how to play soccer!)
Schneider...
And time passed...\nMarch of the Following Year
Isn't it about time for\n<avatar_name> to leave?
It must be tough, going\nabroad alone at this age...
I went with my family, but going by yourself has\nto be intimidating with the different language,\nculture, and environment.
I imagine you'd know, since you\njust went abroad yourself, Fujisawa.
Well, it wasn't all that long. Dad's work\nended sooner than had been expected.
Yeah, I was a bit surprised when\nI heard you'd come back to Japan.
Me, too! And now you're going to\nhigh school with the captain, as well!
...
Jeez, Wakamatsu...!
Haha... Ahaha...







So, I guess Tsubasa's already off to\nBrazil. Didn't you want to go with him,\n<avatar_name>?
But <avatar_name>\nhad to register for school and all,\nhe didn't really have a choice.
So, you're headed to America...\nHow's your English, <avatar_name>?
You could probably get by with the automatic\ntranslator. Too bad you don't have one this time.
<avatar_name> will be fine.\nThat's why we have English classes, right?
You hear that, Captain?
Why are you dragging me into this?
Haha!







So I heard back in Germany, Wakabayashi and\nSchneider are already playing for top teams.
You'd better get famous fast!\nWe're rooting for you!
If you're gonna end up in Brazil anyway, you may\nas well try to become the best player in the\ncountry while you're in the neighborhood!
<avatar_name>, we're expecting\nyou to at least be as good as Tsubasa.
Look! All of Furano's turned up!
Mr. Katagiri! What brings you here today?
I came to see <avatar_name>\noff, of course!
<avatar_name>,\nyou're in for some stiff competition.
Support staff are constantly monitoring players,\nand only the ones they judge the best of the best\nget on the roster. It's harsh.
You will be pushed to your very limits,\nbut I believe you will make it through.\nWork hard and have faith in your talents.
And you keep working hard\nin high school, Matsuyama.
Yeah, I'm not going to let <avatar_name>\nhave all the glory!
Good. Without Tsubasa, Japan needs\nyou to keep it focused, Matsuyama.
Well, I'm afraid I must get going.
I'll be seeing you, <avatar_name>.
Probably, at the Youth Championship.
So school is finally over...
It feels a little unreal... Graduation, I mean.
Yeah, I'm still waiting to wake up.
Makes sense. You were just in America!
Yeah, I was surprised when I heard your\ndad's work let you come back to Japan early.
But I mean, it's great! And now...\nYou're going to school with the Captain!
...
Jeez, Wakamatsu...!
Haha!







Well, it's true!\n<avatar_name> is going to be captain of our\n(Furano's) soccer team starting next month.
It's rare for a 2nd year to be captain, but\nwe know you can do it. Don't let us down.
Could I trouble you for a moment?
Mr. Katagiri?! What are you doing here?
There's a meeting about this year's Hokkaido\ntournament. And since I was in the area...
It's a bit of a bumpy ride up to\nHokkaido this time of year.
Anything for Japanese soccer!
I guess this year's All Japan MS Soccer\ntournament will be all about <avatar_name>,\nSawada, Nitta, and Sano...
Make sure you don't fall behind!
And you keep working hard\nin high school, Matsuyama.
Yeah, I'm not going to let <avatar_name>\nhave all the glory!
Good. Without Tsubasa, Japan needs\nyou to keep it focused, Matsuyama.
Well, I'm afraid I must get going.
I hope to see you at the Youth Championship.
Guess you're off, then.
So I guess Tsubasa's already off to Brazil.\nDidn't you want to go with him,\n<avatar_name>?
But <avatar_name>\nhad to register for school and the like.\nHe didn't have much of a choice.
Going to America...\n<avatar_name>,\nhow's your English?
<avatar_name> will be just fine.\nEven after class, he goes\nand studies with the teacher.
Hey, I'd better start learning a new\nlanguage to get ready and all, myself.
So I guess in Germany, Wakabayashi and\nSchneider are already playing for top teams.
<avatar_name>,\nyou hurry up and get back on the\npitch. We're rooting for you!
But you're off to the other side of the\nworld. No way that's gonna be easy...
Brazil is so big, even just getting around the\ncountry can be a chore, I hear. Take care, okay?
And here's everyone from Toho Academy, too!
Mr. Katagiri!
What brings you here today?
I came to see <avatar_name>\noff, of course!
<avatar_name>,\nyou're headed for some real competition.
Support staff are constantly monitoring players,\nand only the ones they judge the best of the best\nget on the roster. It's harsh.
You will be pushed to your very limits,\nbut I believe you will make it through.\nWork hard and have faith in your talents.
Hyuga, I know you'll be a worthy\nheart for your school team.
The future of that golden team will rely heavily\non your leadership. Don't let them down.
You can absolutely count on me!
I'm not going to fail, even without Tsubasa.
I look forward to seeing what you accomplish.
Well, I'm afraid I must get going.
See you around, <avatar_name>.
Hopefully, at the Youth Championship.
OK, I think this looks good\nfor tomorrow's practice.
Thanks for helping me put together a plan,\n<avatar_name>.
Hey Takeshi, <avatar_name>,\nwhat's up?
Yo, Hyuga!
Practice at school finished\nearly, so I thought I'd jog by.
How is high school practice?
Well, Sorimachi is running circles\naround me and Wakashimazu...
Figures!
It looks like this year's All Japan MS tournament\nis going to be a Toho academy repeat.
Keep at it, Takeshi.\nAnd you, too, <avatar_name>.
Tak! We'll get it done like we always do.
Could I trouble you for a moment?
Mr. Katagiri!
What brings you here today?
I had some business nearby,\nand thought I'd drop in.
Hyuga, I know you'll be a worthy\nheart for your school team.
The future of that golden team will rely heavily\non your leadership. Don't let them down.
You can absolutely count on me!
I'm not going to fail, even without Tsubasa.
I look forward to seeing what you accomplish.
This year's All Japan MS Soccer tournament\nwill be all about <avatar_name>,\nSawada, and the rest of you.
I know that Nitta and Sano, along with other\nrivals not yet revealed, will be working hard to\noverthrow your reign. Stay on top of your game!
We will, Sir!
Well, I'm afraid I must get going.
See you around, <avatar_name>.\nEveryone.
Let's meet at the Youth Championship, shall we?
So you're finally leaving too, <avatar_name>.
I can't believe you're going overseas\nto join a foreign soccer club.
Never pictured this happening, back when we\nfirst starting training together last summer.
But going abroad alone so young?\nMust be tough... In a lot of ways.
But they always say the earlier the better\nfor this sort of thing. I know you'll be fine,\n<avatar_name>!
Have you ever wanted to\njoin a foreign club, Misugi?
Of course I have. I still plan to do it...\nsomeday. But for now, I still have things\nI need to study in Japan.
My dream is to be both a\npro-soccer player and a doctor.
So you want to keep playing soccer while\nalso studying? You'd need to be a genius\nboth physically and mentally to handle that.
But if anyone can do it... It's you\nMisugi. You never fail to amaze.
Jun will be do just great!
It'll take a lot of work though.
By the way, I heard Tsubasa\nalready left for Brazil.
Didn't you want to go with him, <avatar_name>?
Too bad you had to deal with all\nthat red tape with the school. Oh well.
Speaking of America, how are you going\nto get by there? How's your English?
Didn't you have those incredible translator\ndevices back in the tournament? Sure would\nbe nice if you could keep using that.
He'll be fine. I've been practicing\nconversational English with him.
I wish you'd practice with me...
Well, if Misugi says you're fine,\nthen you're fine. You got this, <avatar_name>.
On the topic of Germany, Wakabayashi,\nSchneider, and the rest are already playing\nin matches between the top teams, right?
You've got a lot of work ahead of you if you\nwant to catch up! We'll be rooting for you!
They say Brazilian soccer involves a lot of\nmovement. Make sure not to exhaust yourself!
Why not try beating Tsubasa at his own game if\nyou've got the chance? I have high hopes for you!
Hey there. I see the Musashi crowd has assembled.
Mr. Katagiri! What brings you here today?
I'm here to see <avatar_name> off. Obviously.
From here on out, you'll be\nseeing what real competition is about.
The staff will be constantly checking your\ncondition, and only those who they approve\nwill remain on the team. It's a cutthroat world.
There will be times when you may lose hope...\nBut you'll have to push through that. I believe\nyou can, and you need to believe it, too.
Misugi, what's your plan for high school?
I'm still not sure...
I could take a three year break from soccer\nto focus on treating my heart condition...
...Or I could keep playing while\nreceiving treatment, like I have been.
But either way, I don't plan\non giving up on soccer.
Soccer is my life and will always be in my future.
I understand.
With your brains and talent, Japanese soccer\ncan't afford to lose you. Whatever you decided,\nI hope to see you in the future.
Roger that.
Well then, <avatar_name>.
Let's meet again at another youth tournament!
This might be the last time\nI come to this locker room.
Wow... So much happened during\nour three years here, huh?
To be honest, a lot of it was pretty\nfrustrating, but it was worth it after\nthe Junior Hero League.
Yeah. After that, I really feel like\nwe can graduate without any regrets.
Even in high school, we'll still\nbe rivals with Toho Academy, I guess.
But we're not the same guys we were back\nthen either. No matter how good our opponent is,\nwe'll keep playing our hearts out.
Yup. I mean, if we didn't, we'd be letting\ndown everyone that worked to bring us this far.
Misugi! <avatar_name>!
How'd the meeting to decide\nthe next club captain go?
Well, we unanimously decided to\nname <avatar_name> the next captain.
A second year captain...\nBut who else could it be, right?
I just know you can take Sawada from Toho.
Do what we couldn't and make it to Nationals!\nAnd win! We're counting on you!
Excuse me, am I interrupting?
Mr. Katagiri! What brings you here?
We're holding a meeting on this year's\nTokyo regionals. And since I was in the area,\nI thought I'd drop by.
Now that you mention it, Matsuyama called\nfrom Furano and said you'd stopped by.
You're really flying all over Japan, aren't you?
I'll go anywhere I'm needed,\nif it will advance Japanese soccer.
<avatar_name>, Sawada, Nitta, and Sano will likely\nbe the names to follow for this year's Nationals.
Especially Sawada, since you're both\nrivals in the Tokyo regionals. Try not to lose.
Misugi, what's your plan for high school?
I'm still not sure...
I could take a three year break from soccer\nto focus on treating my heart condition...
...Or I could keep playing while\nreceiving treatment, like I have been.
But either way, I don't plan\non giving up on soccer.
Soccer is my life and will always be in my future.
I understand.
With your brains and talent, Japanese soccer\ncan't afford to lose you. Whatever you decided,\nI hope to see you in the future.
Roger that.
But first, let your bodies get some rest.
Let's meet again at another youth tournament!
Junior Youth World Challenge Quarterfinals,\nFourth Match, Germany vs. America
No way...
Germany...
Germany lost...
Schneider!
Wakabayashi...
I'm sorry.
Schneider...
Wh-What an upset!
America, the host country, has crushed\nthe top contender to win!
For this match, America benched its starters\nthat lost to France yesterday\nand came in with a completely new line-up!
What a drastic strategy!
Also worthy of note, Blake, who had been\nin a forward position since the preliminaries,\nwas suddenly moved to the defense!
And last but not least, their thirteen-year-old\ncaptain, midfielder Ryan Ortiz, made his\nfirst appearance in the tournament!
Having him at the helm pulled\nthe whole crazy scheme together.
With Blake sticking to Heine,\napplying pressure while avoiding fouls,\nthey could shut him down as a playmaker!
Meanwhile, Ryan toyed with the German volantes,\nSchester and Kaltz.
To top it off, with precise commands\nand fast action from the team, he crumpled\nthe German defense like a used tissue.
To be fair, Germany's Schneider did manage\nto score two goals with his Fire Shot.
But American goalie Azwan displayed\nreal tenacity, as well, blocking countless\nmore with his fine saves.
Against all the odds... America came out ahead!
And now for an interview with\nthe American captain, Ryan.
Schneider is an incredible player. Not only his\nshooting, but his passing and dribbling, too.\nWe knew taking him on would be a struggle.
Today's victory belongs to Blake and Azwan\nfor doing so well on defense.
They played better than I thought they could...\nThat came out a bit wrong, sorry.
The next match against Brazil is going to be\nfierce, but I think with some careful thought\nwe can give them a proper run for their money.
BO-RING! I can't stand marking\nthe same guy all game.
Hey, Ryan! You're always too focused on offense.\nThink about defense a little more!
Do you even realize how tough it is\nto stop that Fire Shot?!
What are you two complaining about?\nEverything we did was needed to win, wasn't it?
Heine's worried about his ankle, so he'll back\ndown if it looks like things'll get hairy.
So if Blake is marking him, he's\nworried he'll get roughed up, since\nBlake is best at power plays.
...
And Schneider is a world-class forward. It'd be\nimpossible for our team to stop him completely.
I could take him on one-on-one, but if I did that\nSchester and Kaltz would roam free, which would\nwaste our efforts to keep Heine pinned down.
In which case, we'd be better off sacrificing\ndefense, so I could distract Schester and Kaltz\nwith my offense.
By exploiting Germany's weak defense, we were\nlikely to score more goals than Schneider.\nIt had by far the best odds.
Well, yeah, but still...
Don't misunderstand, Azwan.\nOur only goal is to win, not to prevent\nthe other team from ever scoring.
Fine, fine, whatever you say.
The points we lost today will lay the groundwork\nfor tomorrow's victory.
We've made Brazil think we've got a weakness\nin our defenses.
Jeez, you really are a viper, aren't you?
I'll take that as a compliment.
(Now then, Japan's next opponent is France?)
(Normally I'd expect France to win,\nbut it's hard to say what will happen for sure.)
(I mean, were I involved,\nI'd be pretty sure, but...)
What about Number 10, that Ryan guy?\nWe never saw him in the scrim.
Yeah... Maybe he's like their secret\nweapon for the tournament?
Ryan Ortiz... Yeah, who is he really?
Tsubasa, he's...
I never thought Ryan would be that good...
You know him, <avatar_name>?
Don't tell me you know him, <avatar_name>?
Tell me everything you know!
So he's a student of Cardinal's soccer school?
The skill he had to control the midfield\nagainst Germany like that makes him\na match for Tsubasa, I'd say.
And it's not just technique, either.\nHe was a fair tactician, making the right calls.
Germany isn't exactly inflexible with their\nplays. But to predict their moves and shut them\ndown like that... Just how perceptive is he?
(They're right. This Ryan guy has it all:\ntechnique, tactics, authority...\nHe's an amazing player.)
(But I've got an odd gut feeling about him...\nLike he's missing something.)
(I just can't pin it down...)
Junior Youth World Challenge Semifinals,\nSecond Match, Brazil vs. America
America, huh? I was really hoping to play Germany.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna catch\nthat famous Fire Shot from Schneider?
Stay focused, Keizinho.
America took down Germany with a near flawless\nperformance. We can't underestimate them.
Yeah, I got ya.
But that Number 10 player, Ryan Ortiz.\nSomething about him creeps me out.
Same.
He's not just skilled, the way he thinks\nabout soccer is fundamentally different.\nThat's the impression I get, anyway.
It doesn't matter who our opponent is.\nJust keep the ball comin' to me like always.
If you can manage that, then I'll get us the win.
Sure, same as always!
...
Let's do this, guys!
For sure!
...
As you can see from the handouts,\nI've already analyzed the Brazilian players'\nstrengths and habits.
...
...
As all of you have studied at the soccer school,\nI'm sure you can parse that data.\nYou'd never be able to win without me.
But WITH me, we're 100% going to win, no question.
Only I know the path to victory, so don't\ndo anything crazy like thinking on your own.\nYou need only follow my instructions.
...
...
Got that, everyone?
Brazil versus America...\nWho do you think'll be our next opponent?
It's gotta be Brazil, right?
Yeah, I guess.
And it wasn't just a fluke that America\ntoppled Germany. We need to treat that match\nas them really playing.
Which means it all comes down to\ntheir Number 10, Ryan...
...
You'd rather play Brazil, right Tsubasa?
Huh? Uh, yeah...
Tsubasa?
(I should be confident that Brazil will win,\nbut why do I feel so uneasy?)
(Ryan Ortiz...)
(I'm still not sure what made me\nuncomfortable about him last game.)
(It sure wasn't something as obvious as technique\nor style. It was something more... basic.)
(But what the heck is it?)
Hey, the match is starting.
Now this is one to pay special\nattention to folks! Here's the kickoff!
The Brazilian ace Carlos immediately seizes the\nball and dribbles straight into enemy lines!
(That's it. That's the only choice you'd make.)
(It was already clear, since you didn't make\na single pass this tournament.)
This is it, boys! Keep your angles and spacing\njust like I told you!
Now go!
Right on!
Not good enough!
And Carlos evades America's fierce tackle\nwith his peerless ball control!
(Carlos Bara. Your ball control and agility\nare as precise and efficient as a machine.)
(But that's how I can tell exactly how you'll\ndodge a tackle, and exactly how far\nthe ball will travel from your feet.)
Now.
Whoa, now! Ryan just stole the ball from Carlos!
Im-Impossible!
Blake!
And he passes it along to his forward, Blake!\nAmerica is on the counterattack!
Not so fast!
Outta my way!
Łoł!
Blake unbalances and trips up Leo\nwith powerful dribbling!
It's on, Brazil! Just try and stop me!
(So he's charging right up the middle, huh?)
Lock down the center!
Left, Blake. Pass to Walker.
...
Blake!
Tch.
What's this? At Ryan's command, Blake passed\nto Walker! They're coming down the line now!
Oh no!
With Brazil's defense concentrated in the middle,\nthey can't respond in time!
And that's all the opportunity America needs\nto charge deep into Brazilian territory!
Behind you to the right, Walker! Pass to Allen!
Allen, change sides!
The Americans are tangling up Brazil's defense\nby passing the ball around at Ryan's direction!
Send it to your left, Freeman.
And finally, Ryan has the ball!
Gah...! I'll stop you myself!
(Captain Alberto has a strong sense\nof responsibility.)
(His flawed orders created this situation,\nso he'll want to fix it personally...\nSo painfully obvious.)
As if... Not with your skill!
Ryan slips past Alberto! He's showing off the\nsame technique that he used to take down\nGermany's volantes!
Blake!
And he sends the ball to Blake!
Bring it on! I don't care how much\nheat you bring. I'll be right in the way!
And end up in the back of the net with the ball!
Whoa... that's heavy!
Keizinho barely manages to stop\nBlake's fearsome shot!
But what's this?!\nRyan is sprinting toward the rebound!
It's as if he already knew\nwhere the ricochet would go!
(Exactly. You were going to have to bat down, but\nnot catch, a shot from Blake at that distance.)
(Meaning the ball would definitely rebound.)
(And now you're right where I want you,\ntime to kick to the opposite corner...)
There!
GOAL! America takes the first point!
Ryan's shot takes scores on Brazil!
Darn! I was sure I could stop that just now!
Still though, Ryan both made the goal AND stole\nthe ball in the first place.\nIt's like he got us all by himself.
Get it together. There's still plenty of time.
Right. Keep passing to me. I won't fail again.
Do you all get it yet? No matter what\nyou think you see, just follow my directions,\nand victory is assured.
...
Now that we've secured the first point,\nBrazil will start to lean on Carlos even more.
In other words, all you need to do\nis keep him marked along with anyone\nwho's going to send him the ball.
There's plenty of time left on the clock.\nWhy don't we show the world\nwhat America is capable of?
Later:
A-And that's the game!
Brazil, the king of soccer, has fallen!
The host country America continues their\ngiant-killing streak started with Germany!
But despite their miraculous showing,\nthe American players don't seem to be celebrating.
Maybe they still can't believe\nhow completely they dominated the match?
Regardless, the man running the show today\nwas no doubt Number 10, Ryan Ortiz!
On offense, his teammates toyed with Brazil's\ndefense by following his calls, and he personally\npulled off a hat trick to boot!
On defense, he easily predicted\nBrazil's passes and through decisive action\ncompletely shut them out.
Anyone watching no doubt also noticed,\nhe took it on himself to mark Carlos\nand never let him keep the ball.
As a result, Carlos never managed to score\na single goal all match!
Carlos must be feeling the sting\nof that shut out, while bearing the\nburden of the kings of soccer!
And now for an interview with\nthe American captain, Ryan.
As I said after the last match,\nI did a lot of research in preparation for\ntoday's match with Brazil.
Carlos was certainly a fearsome player, excelling\nat everything from dribbling to shooting...
But after an exhaustive analysis,\nI noticed a number of habits he had,\nwhich I exploited to get the ball from him.
Azwan might've been bored without\nanything to do in goal, but oh well.
I only managed to get a hat trick\nthanks to Blake, though.
Blake's shots have a tremendous\namount of momentum.
I figured the goalie would end up merely knocking\ndown a lot of them, so I watched for the rebounds.
Then, I simply had to aim my kick to keep\nthe shot going to the right part of the goal.
Unfortunately I don't have Blake's impressive\npower, so all I could do was use the simple tools\nI have as efficiently as possible.
The finals will be up against Japan, a tough\nopponent who's beaten a number of strong teams,\nbut at this point there's no way we can lose.
With the benefit of careful research, our victory\nis assured. America will take the championship!
...Another boring match.
Hey, you had it good! At least you got to play!
I just stood there twiddling my thumbs the whole\ntime. It's like you didn't even need me.
...
Hey, Blake... Is this really okay?
The goal of the "game" is simply to win,\nand we're all just pawns. You know that.
Ugh...
This truly was Ryan's match! Soup to nuts!
From his own personal efforts, to his\ninstructions to teammates, to the way he shut\ndown his opponents, it was all a streamlined plan.
Truly, we could even call him\nthe Tyrant of the Field!
I gave up everything for soccer...\nAnd this is what my sacrifice got me?!
What did I do to deserve this, God?!\nWas I not sufficient?!
Carlos...
(I'm sure this would've gone differently...)
(If he weren't playing as this new Carlos Bara,\nbut as the old him.)
I'm sorry guys.\nThis is all because of my sloppy leadership.
It's not your fault, Captain.\nI wasn't able to defend the goal. It's on me.
...Winning and losing aside,\nthat was one dull match.
Brazil lost, Tsubasa.
Yeah... I guess the bad feeling I got before\nthe match was more than just a feeling.
When did America get this good?
Well, not "America" so much as Ryan, personally.
What a player. He did all that himself.
<avatar_name>! Tsubasa Ozora!
H-Hey, he's calling you guys out!
Let's see what he wants, <avatar_name>.
Did you get a good look at my work, <avatar_name>?
I didn't think you could play that well.
You did okay, I guess.
It was such a let down.
If so, you must be a terrible judge of talent.
If you like, I could coach you next time.\nWhether or not you'd be able to comprehend\nmy teaching is another matter, though.
"Okay," huh? Maybe you understand better\nwhat I'm capable of than I thought.
How indignant!
You're the first person to ever\nspeak that way to me!
Now then... I suppose it's nice to meet you,\nTsubasa Ozora.
I am Ryan Ortiz.
Ah, yeah...
(Wh-What's this feeling...?)
Hmm?
(What's this feeling?!)
(Oh right! I felt this gaze during the scrimmage!)
So you noticed.
That's right. I kept my eye on you all through\nthe scrimmage. You possess incredible talent.
But unfortunately for you, your improvement\nwas entirely within expected parameters.\nTo be honest, it's a disappointment.
What?!
Well, I still have some hope that\nyou'll keep putting the effort in and show\nsome improvement by finals time.
After all, this is all warm-up for our match.
...Whoops, please excuse me.\nI've perhaps said too much.
...?
Regardless, since I'm letting you face me,\nI hope you'll let me enjoy it.
The finals won't be like today.\nMy team and I will really be going all out.
No way... Are you saying you weren't\ntaking that match seriously?!
(If so, then in order for us to beat them\nand become the champions...)
(We'll need to play more on edge than\nwe ever have! We can't afford not to focus\nsolely on the win!)
Alright guys, let's head back and keep practicing!
We're going to prepare as much as possible\nbefore the finals! And then we'll win!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
(Who'd have thought that Brazil and Carlos\nwould lose to a single player...?)
(America's Number 10, Ryan Ortiz...)
(To have achieved such perfect skill,\nunderstanding, and authority at such\na young age... What a terrifying player.)
(No matter how much Tsubasa improves before the\nfinals, his chances of winning are slim to none.)
(But...)
(From what I can tell,\nRyan's methods have a weakness.)
(If Tsubasa can ascertain that weakness\nand make use of it, there's a chance.)
(But that's a big if...)
...
Tsubasa, I...
So tomorrow's the finals?
Yes, sir.
But how unfortunate America made it this far.\nA few days ago it would've been unthinkable.
...The initial plan was to lose\nin the quarterfinals?
The Illusionary Goalie was expected to join\nthe German team starting with the semifinals.
While the intel our staff dug up in Europe\nwas fascinating, an even more\ninteresting player came along in the interim.
You mean Tsubasa Ozora.
Indeed. He's an incredible performer.\nYou can count the number of players with\nthat kind of talent on one hand.
But there's someone else I've had my eye on too.
<avatar_name>.
<avatar_name>, huh?\nCertainly, he's a skilled player.
But not so skilled that you of all people\nwould take notice of him, is he?
I suppose that just means I have a better eye\nfor these things than you, Mr. Cardinal.
Hmph. Cheeky.
So then tell me, Ryan... What do you seen in him?
He has incredible potential, no question.\nThe only others in this tournament\nwho even compare are Schneider and Tsubasa.
It's just... I'm still ironing out the details.
Oh? Even with YOUR insight?
<avatar_name>'s not like any category of player\nI've encountered before. \nHe doesn't fit into any of my existing models.
If I had to say, he's someone, but also no one...
How much he'll improve, what kind of player he'll\nbe in the future... It's all outside my framework.
That being the case, I thought I'd ascertain\nhis potential in a real match.
And see if he's someone who'd stand\nin the way of the Project.
Project Crown.\nThe plan to "coronate" American soccer.
Despite being hailed as the most sports-loving\ncountry in the world, America has yet to reach the\nsummit of the world's most popular sport: soccer.
In other words, this project is meant to build\na team that can win the World Cup.
While obviously we've gathered the cream\nof the crop from all across America...
We've also poached players like Blake,\nwho've excelled in other sports,\nand brought them into soccer.
Along with bringing in and naturalizing\nforeign players like Azwan, we've managed\nto secure an immense amount of talent.
And of course we've trained them in the\nsoccer school you founded, utilizing the best\nequipment and the latest science.
Of course, that's just the beginning.
In order to collect data on our future rivals\nfor the World Cup...
We gathered the support of all the countries\nthat weren't invited to the\nFrench International Junior Youth Tournament.
And hosted this Junior Youth World Challenge\non our home turf.
That's been the whole purpose of this tournament\nfrom the very beginning...
But I altered the plan based on my own desires.\nI'm sorry.
Don't be. A plan is just a starting point.\nIt's only natural to adjust it\nwhen you find new opportunities.
It's a little earlier than we expected,\nbut why not take this chance to crown America\nthe new kings of soccer?
Of course, sir.
Even with <avatar_name> and Tsubasa,\nJapan poses no real threat.
The analysis of their capabilities\nwill give us the perfect strategy.
After that, all that's left is for the others\nto follow orders.
(They've come so far.)
(Three years ago, when I saw them at Nationals, I\nknew they'd change Japanese soccer forever. And\nnow they've dwarfed all past accomplishments.)
(Especially Tsubasa Ozora. Maybe it was for\nthe best that he didn't go to Brazil sooner.)
(The other players of his generation were fired\nup just to chase his shadow and dream of\ndefeating him. But it made them better.)
(And now, three years later, Kojiro Hyuga has\nnearly caught up with him, and the other players\ncontinue to grow with him driving them.)
(Tsubasa, too. He's grown so much that there's\nno one left in Japan who could rival him.)
(Adding in Misaki and Wakabayashi, who went to\ntrain in France and Germany, they're undoubtedly\nthe right team for the All-Japan Junior Youths.)
(And they've finally arrived here.)
(But this is no place to feel complacent.\nOnce they beat the America Junior Youths,\nthat's when the real journey embarks.)
(There's still a long road to our dream\nof a Japanese World Cup victory.)
(But winning this tournament\nwill be the first step!)
Mr. Katagiri!
You're... Roberto?!
Thank goodness. I just had to see you.
Me?
Yes, you. Actually, it's about today's match.
I'd like you to give Tsubasa some advice for me.
You're giving Tsubasa advice?!
...Alright then. Let's hear it.
Thank you so much.
Please tell him not to forget what's on page 52\nof the notebook during today's match.
Page 52 of the notebook, got it.\nI'll let him know right away.
I'm counting on you.
Will you be watching today, Roberto?
Yes. I have a seat in block B.
Then, I'll speak with you later.
...
Man, it's finally the finals, huh? Jeez, this is\nnerve-wracking. How're you holding up, Urabe?
Just don't get scared and freeze up out there,\nIshizaki.
Hey, who said I was scared?\nI was born for the big stage!
...Heh, you might be right about that.
Haha.
Oh, it's Mr. Katagiri. What brings you here?
Where's Tsubasa?
Tsubasa said he wanted to focus by himself\nand went down to see the field.
I see.
Tsubasa wants to be alone? That's rare.
Guess even he's feeling nervous this time.
(The whole game depends on whether\nI can handle Ryan.)
(But seeing how he single-handedly pinned down\nGermany's midfield and Brazil's Carlos,\nhe might be too good, even for me.)
(Plus, he has the brains to see through\nhis opponents, and the skill to perfectly\ncommand his teammates.)
(Last night, I thought through what we could do\nin so many situations, but I just couldn't see us\nwinning. This is the first time that's happened.)
(Either way though, it's do or die.\nWe can't back down after coming so far.)
(Somehow, we'll win.\nAnd then the championship is ours!)
Tsubasa.
Oh, Mr. Katagiri.
Don't forget about page 52 of the notebook.
Uh...?
Tsubasa, the meeting is about to start. 
Okay, got it!
Well then, good luck, Tsubasa.
(Strona 52...?)
C'mon, we gotta get going!
S-Sure.
(Strona 52...)
...!
(Wait, could it be... Roberto?!)
Stay focused, Keizinho.
America took down Germany with a near flawless\nperformance. We can't underestimate them.
But that Number 10 player, Ryan Ortiz.\nSomething about him creeps me out.
Same.
He's not just skilled, the way he thinks\nabout soccer is fundamentally different.\nThat's the impression I get, anyway.
It doesn't matter who our opponent is.\nJust keep the ball comin' to me like always.
If you can manage that, then I'll get us the win.
...
Let's do this, guys!
...
Not good enough!
Wh-What?!
Not so fast!
Łoł!
(So he's charging right up the middle, huh?)
Lock down the center!
Oh no!
Gah...! I'll stop you myself!
Still though, Ryan both made the goal\nAND stole the ball in the first place.\nIt's like he got us all by himself.
Get it together. There's still plenty of time.
Right. Keep passing to me. I won't fail again.
I gave up everything for soccer...\nHow can this be the outcome?!
What did I do to deserve this, God?!\nWas I not devoted enough?!
Carlos...
(I'm sure this would've gone differently...)
(If he weren't playing as this new Carlos Bara,\nbut as the old him.)
I'm sorry guys.\nThis is all because of my sloppy leadership.
Okay boys, let's talk.
Today, we're doing it just like\nwe talked about yesterday.
It's up to you to make it work.
After beating both Germany and Brazil, America's\ntalent is definitely the genuine article.
We have to watch out for the powerhouse forward,\nBlake, and their goalie Azwan,\nwho was able to catch the Fire Shot, but...
The man we absolutely can't take our eyes off\nis their midfielder, Ryan.
We can go for the old standby of marking\nhim close and keeping the ball from him...
But what's troubling is his ability\nto read what we're going to do next.
He may even end up using our marking against us.\nThat's just how good of a leader he is.\nHe can find opportunity in anything.
So what you're saying is that the most important\nthing in this match is to outsmart Ryan?
But how can we win without using\nany of the plays we're good at?
Yeah, it's not like the American players\naren't also in peak physical condition.\nAnd they've got skill to spare.
It'd be naive to think we could take them on\nwith something we've never practiced.
Plus, how do we know he wouldn't\njust anticipate that we'd try that?
If that's the case, then what CAN we do?
We'll win with hard work and guts!
We'll surpass him in smarts and technique!
If it worked like that, Germany and Brazil\nwouldn't have lost either.
But if we could do that, wouldn't Germany\nor Brazil have worked something out, too?
Do we really have to be so scared of just one guy?
Jeez, this guy is really getting on my nerves!
I mean, we made it this far. We HAVE to win this.
...
Tsubasa?
Hey, could I say something?
Sure, what's up?
I've got something I want you all to hear.
This is straight from the notebook\nRoberto left for me.
"Tsubasa, what makes soccer so fun for you?"
"It's the most loved, most popular sport\nin the world."
"I think it's because soccer is\nthe purest, freest sport there is."
"Once you're on the field, you're free to\nplay... free to think and act for yourself."
"There are boundless possibilities with ten\ncomrades focusing on one ball and one battle."
"Soccer is freedom. What will\nyou do in the middle of that field?"
"You can do anything you want. You can dribble,\npass, or shoot. You can just stand still."
"If you pass, you can pass forward, to the side,\nback... Anywhere is okay. The same with dribbling.\n"
"Soccer is freedom, Tsubasa.\nThat's what I love about the game."
"And if you're going to keep playing, I want you\nto learn to love it like I do. More than anyone."
Heh, Roberto...\nHe gets it just right sometimes, doesn't he?
That's for sure. He wasn't Brazil's Number 10\nfor nothing. This is the heart of a top player.
Learn to love it like he does?
Something's been bothering me ever since\nI first saw Ryan play. I couldn't tell\nwhat exactly it was, though.
But now that I remember Roberto's words,\nI know what it is.
What is it then?
Ryan plays soccer in order to win\nas efficiently as possible.
He analyzes players to learn their bad habits,\nand studies other teams to find gaps in their\nstrategy. And then he exploits those weaknesses.
There's nothing in there about the plays HE wants\nto make, just the most efficient plays to win. And\nhe uses his teammates as pawns to achieve that.
That's the foundation of Ryan's soccer.
Hmm... I see.
Winning today, means we're the best in the world.\nObviously, I really, really want to win.\nSame as everyone.
But I think we can do that\nwithout adopting Ryan's mindset.
If America wants to win through data and\ndiscipline, then let's win by thinking for\nourselves and expressing our own ideas.
On a grand stage, we need to make it\nabout more than winning and losing.
Let's play the soccer we want to play!\nLet's enjoy the game for what it is!
Tsubasa...!
True, I guess we've only been focused\non what we need to do to win...
Yeah, winning is important,\nbut soccer is more than that.
We can't let an obsession with winning games\nmake us forget the fun of playing together.
Yeah... You taught me that this summer, Tsubasa.
I agree with Tsubasa, too. Let's pool\nour strength, and enjoy the game!
Tak!
I think that's all that need be said.
Go out there and show everyone your hard-earned\nskill! Go out there and play for love of the game!
Yes, Coach!
Hang on, guys.
What now?
Let's huddle up before the game real quick.
Oh, good idea.
Okay then, <avatar_name>,\nI want you to give these guys a pep talk.
M-Me?!
Of course! You can count on me!
Way to be. Believe in yourself.
I figured you'd say something like that.
Heh, looks like he's getting into it already!
Come on, <avatar_name>\nstoke the fire!
We've been working together as a team.\nTraining, talking, and helping each other improve.
If America is using data as their weapon,\nwe just have to surpass their data by allowing\nour own ideas to take shape on the pitch!
How did we get here? By working together as a\nteam. Training, talking, and helping each other\nbecome better.
If America's weapon is their data, ours is\nour imagination! And their data can be beat!
We've been working together as a team. Training,\ntalking, and helping each other improve.
America's weapon is their data. But we have\nour imaginations, and with that we can be\nmore than their data can possibly analyze!
How did we get so strong? We've been working\ntogether as a team. Training, talking,\nand helping each other get better.
America has their data, but their data doesn't\ncover what we can come up with on our own!\nWe're greater than some numbers!
Okay, then! Let's get this party started!
Yeah, <avatar_name>,\nkeep going!
This tournament has shown us a new, wider world.\nWe've made friends we never would have otherwise.\nThey're cheering for us now.
There's no reason to be scared just because we're\non the opponent's home turf! Let's win with our\nown ideas and not let our new friends down!
This tournament has expanded our horizons,\nand given us friends we'd never have otherwise.\nComing to America has been a true blessing!
This is our opponent's home field, but that\nshouldn't bother us. Our friends are rooting\nfor us! Let's win with our own approach!
Playing in this tournament has shown us the world,\nand given us friends we'd never have otherwise.\nThey're cheering us on now.
The opponent has a home field advantage, but\nthat's irrelevant! Let's live up to our new\nfriends' expectations and win with our own ideas!
This tournament has shown us a new, wider world.\nWe've made friends we'd never have otherwise.\nThey're cheering for us now.
The opponent has a home field advantage, but\nthat's no reason to back down! Let's live up\nto our new friends' expectations and win!
Heh, we've really proven\nourselves by coming this far!
<avatar_name>,\ngive us everything you've got!\nFire it up!
We dream of winning the World Cup.\nToday's match opens up that path!\nWe can't let glory elude us here!
All we've done so far has been for today! We need\nto keep our minds open and play our hearts out!\nAmerica's data doesn't stand a chance!
Today's match is the first step toward our dream\nof World Cup victory. We can't falter here!
Just believe in all the effort we've made to come\nthis far! Who cares about America's data?!\nJust keep your eyes and mind open, and have fun!
Today's match is the first step toward our dream\nof World Cup victory. We can't stumble here!
Believe in yourselves and in the efforts\nyou've made! But above all else, have fun!\nWe're better than America's data!
Today's match is the first step\ntoward our dream of World Cup victory.\nThe only acceptable thing to do is win.
Believe in our bond, and the efforts we've made\nso far! Play soccer the way you know it's meant\nto be played, and America's data is nothing!
Let's make it happen, guys!
Let's beat America and become world champs!
Let's play like this is the World Cup finals!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Alright, since we're already huddled up,\nwhy don't you lead the cheer, <avatar_name>!
Alright people, today's the day\nAmerica becomes a champion.
...
...
This isn't the same Japan our reserve member team\nplayed back in the scrimmages.
But even so, they're still no match for us.\nThere's nothing to be concerned about.
I've already informed you of the roles each of\nyou will play. Perform your duties faithfully,\nand we'll win. Simple as that.
Our perfect victory and subsequent championship\nwill be the cherry on top to cap off\nthe completion of Project Crown.
...Is it really going to be that easy, though?
Do you have something to say, Azwan?
Not really.
I'm just getting a bad feeling\nabout today's match.
Hahaha!
Azwan, has soccer school taught you nothing?\nWhy are you giving irrational emotions\nlike that even the slightest heed?
Hey, Ryan, you'd do well to trust\nyour gut now and then.
You, too, Blake.
I mean, you do know that first class athletes\nand gamblers have like a sixth sense\nfor opportunities and pitfalls, don't you?
Then why don't you tell me the basis\nfor these "bad feelings" of yours?
If it sounds plausible enough,\neven I can be persuaded to change my mind.
Well?
...
...
Sheesh. Then don't interrupt me\nwith your superstitious nonsense.
My methods are flawless. They have been so far,\nand they will be from here on out. All you lot\nneed to do is keep quiet and follow.
Now, let's go display our perfection to the world!
...Right!
I kinda get what you were saying, Azwan.
Like, the Japan from the scrim\nand the Japan today are totally\ndifferent, right? Something like that?
There's no way we're losing to them in raw stats.\nAnd it's not like I don't trust Ryan, either.\nBut... something's bugging me.
Yeah.
Time to kick off the finals of the first Junior\nYouth World Challenge with Japan versus America!
The massive crowd is already going wild!
Both of these teams are underdogs who've crushed\none strong team after another to arrive\nat the finals today!
This match is being broadcast globally,\nso soccer fans from every corner of the\nworld are tuning in!
Will the team that comes out ahead today\nbe America, led by the Tyrant of the Field,\nRyan Ortiz?
Or will it be the All-Japan Junior Youth team\nled by soccer prodigy, Tsubasa Ozora?!
You won't want to turn away\nfrom this game for a second!
Or could it even be Japan's other ace player,\n<avatar_name>?
He's been made vice captain for this critical\nmatch, in honor of his contributions to the team!
He's one to watch!
We're approaching the kickoff\nfor this historic match!
Who will be victorious?
Predictions put America comfortably on top.
Still, those of us who've played them\nwill tell ya...
Japan has a true well of strength.
Neither team is going to be safe\nletting down their guards\nuntil the final whistle!
(Finals. Each time we've seen a competition\nthrough to this point, it's felt magnificent.)
(There is no tomorrow. We must\nplay with all that we are today.)
(But today's match is even more\nspecial than that.)
(After all, this match will decide the world's\nbest in middle school soccer! I get to play on\nthe largest stage with the best teammates!)
(Today I'm going to play in the most\nexciting finals I've even been in...)
(And we're going to win!)
Hey there. I'm looking forward to our showdown,\nyou two.
Hi, Ryan. Let's have a good match.
A good match?
Us? With you? That might be a tall order. That\nmuch is clear from the data we have on you.
Let me make this clear.\nYou have a 0% chance of winning.
I'll just congratulate you on second place now,\nto save some time.
(Why was he smiling?)
(Just the reckless defiance of someone\nwith no hope and nothing to lose?)
(We've got something to show you, Ryan.)
(It's time you saw what soccer should be!)
Hey there. I'm looking forward to our showdown,\n<avatar_name>... Tsubasa...
Let's all do our best.
It's time to pay you back for the scrim.
Don't go too hard on us.
That's a tough request. After all, my entire\nstrategy is to prevent you from doing your best.
You're still carrying a grudge from that?\nHow surprisingly vindictive of you.
So you're asking us to go easy on you? Can I take\nthat as an early acknowledgement of your loss?
Hi, Ryan. Let's have a good match.
A good match?
Us? With you? That might be a tall order. That\nmuch is clear from the data we have on you.
Let me make this clear.\nYou have a 0% chance of winning.
I'll just congratulate you on second place now,\nto save some time.
(Why was he smiling?)
(Just the reckless defiance of someone\nwith no hope and nothing to lose?)
After that exchange with Ryan just now,\nI'm sure of it. My hunch was right.
So let's show him how we play!
Time to have some fun!
Let's give this everything we've got!
Tak! Let's play the soccer we love!
Tak! Let's use our heads and our bodies,\nand play the soccer we love!
(Schneider... Kaltz...)
(Wakabayashi...)
Don't you dare lose, Wakabayashi!
(So they came to watch, huh?)
(Then keep on watching me, you two.)
(Having studied in Germany and grown up alongside\nyou, I'll win this for you! And for Germany!)
(Genzo Wakabayashi. You're absurdly good against\nshots made from outside the penalty box.)
(So you'd assume that a data-oriented player like\nmyself would try to avoid shooting from there,\nwouldn't you?)
(But in this case, I can easily steal a goal\nfrom outside the penalty box.)
(I hope you'll enjoy the surprise.)
(I can still feel the oomph from Blake's shot\nfrom the scrim. Feels like it was yesterday.)
(But if I can't handle it now, they'll just\ntake advantage of the rebound like\nthey did with Brazil.)
(I expect this to be a close match, too. I can't\nafford to let them get even a single point!)
Wakashimazu!
(Wait, is that...?!)
Keizinho!
Don't forget about our\nspecial training from before!
If anyone can stop them, it's you!
Relax, I'll be fine.
I won't let our training go to waste!
I'll hold onto that ball even if it cripples me!
(Huh. Doesn't that goalie seem kinda weak,\neven for a Japanese guy?)
(Against a guy like that, I bet I don't even\nneed to wait for Ryan's orders!\nI can blow him away myself!)
(We saw it back in the scrimmage, but Blake's\nshot has a crazy amount of force behind it.)
(Will I really be okay if I stop it\nwith my arm or my body...?)
(Heh... To be honest, I'm scared stiff over here.)
(I'm pathetic.)
Morisaki!
Tsubasa! <avatar_name>!
The ball is your friend!
You just need to catch a friend!
Huh?
Looks like we were thinking the same thing.
Huh?
Well, you heard him, Morisaki.
Think of the ball as a friend. Someone who loves\nsoccer as much as you can catch it just fine!
Tsubasa, <avatar_name>...
(Oh right. Tsubasa used to cheer me up\nthat way back in elementary school, too.)
(I just need to remember what that felt like.)
You're exactly right!
The ball is my friend, so why should I be scared?
That's the spirit, Morisaki!\nWe're counting on you!
Yeah, just leave it to me!\nNo shots are getting through on my watch!
Hey, so Ryan's the same age as me\nand <avatar_name>, right?
We're all the same age, so how come\nhe's so amazing? We can't let him show us up!
Us first years need to do our best!
Let's show 'em us younger guys can play, too!
Yeah, we can do this Takeshi!
Tak! We'll win this game together!
Good idea! I mean, we were chosen out of all\nthese amazing people, so we need to do\nat least that much!
Huh? Uh... yeah! You're pretty into this,\naren't you, <avatar_name>?
Alright! We can't lose now!
Hey, whatcha two talking about over there?
We were just saying that we can't lose to Ryan,\nsince he's the same age as us.
We can't keep relying on the others\njust 'cause we're younger.
Oh, so that's how it is?
Then count us in, too!
Huh?
Tak! Me and Sano are younger than\nthe rest of the team, too!
But if the older kids hog the spotlight,\nthen what was even the point in coming here?
And four heads are better than two, right?\nWe wanna show our stuff out there, too!
I never knew you two felt that way...
Alright then! Let's do this, you guys!
Heh. Time to make sure they'll never forget us!
Yup! The championship belongs to the young!
Let's put our hearts into this!
We're not losing to the older kids!
Right on!
All the way!
Jeez, never thought I'd be stuck with Ishizaki\nfor the finals of an International Tournament.\nAnd on defense, nonetheless!
Shut up! What do you mean "stuck with"?!\nI've gotten a little better, I mean,\nWAY better since elementary school, y'know!
Oh really? I'm not so sure about that.
Fine, then we'll settle it during the match!
Settle what?
We're on defense, so we'll see who's better\nby stopping the opponent, duh!
Hmph. You're on! We'll just see who\nthe better defender is!
Racja! Zróbmy to!
Heh, this is weird. As soon as I thought of it\nas competing with you, I got way more\ninto this match!
Hmph, obviously.
Yeah... Obviously.
We're like Tsubasa and Hyuga.
Maybe a little less flashy.
But we're still rivals!
Alright! I'm not losing to you!
Just don't come crying to me later!
Roberto!
Oh, Coach Barbas!
Hello!
I thought you'd be here.\nI mean, this is your protege's big moment.
Are you really going to recruit Tsubasa?
Yeah. I thought I'd formally\napproach him after the finals.
He'll get a chance to play these guys again after\nhe comes to Argentina. That's when he'll get his\npayback.
...
Coach Barbas, who do you think\nis going to win today?
Sad to say, but the USA. Even with Tsubasa Ozora,\nthere's no way Japan can defeat them.
That Ryan is something else, just like Tsubasa.
He's not really the type I'd like\nto recruit, though...
So... If Japan does win, can you put\nthis scouting thing on hold for me?
What do you mean?
I...
I want a chance to recruit him\nfor my team in Brazil first.
Roberto!
(Strona 52...)
(Mr. Katagiri has seen the notebook, but\nhe can't remember the whole thing, right?)
(Roberto must be...)
(Roberto must be watching the game right now!)
(He's watching me play!)
Roberto! Heeey!
It looks like Tsubasa's going full throttle!
Tsubasa?! What's he doing?!
They did it! Despite being the away team,\nJapan takes the first point!
Impossible. How could they score on ME...?
Ryan.
...This was a fluke. It's irrelevant.
But if you want to catch up and take the lead,\nyou just need to follow my orders!
Got it!
Might as well just roll it on\nover!
You'll need more than THAT!
Zero times two is still zero!
You could make money with that\nshow!
I'll never get tired of the\ncircus!
Tiger? More like kitten.
That's it? Pathetic.
Just your usual greeting then?
...About as good as Blake, I\nguess.
Whoa... Now that's a heck of a\nhello.
Guess you haven't gotten much better\nsince the scrimmage.
I'm surprised a team like yours even made it\nto the finals!
Darn it!
That jerk... He's mocking us!
Let's wipe that smirk off his face, Tsubasa!
You know it! Like I'd let him get the last laugh!
Heh. You'd make a good striker.
Duh! The greater the challenge, the better! And\nsomeone who's already beaten me is just perfect!
Yeah, we still owe him a debt, don't we?!
Why are those two so happy about their shots\nbeing stopped...? It doesn't make any sense.
Are we just going to let him say that?!
Be patient, we'll get our chance.
We'll shut him up ourselves!
Of course not. We'll definitely score a goal,\nand with our own power!
Yeah, you're right. If we let him get to us,\nit'll just make our play more predictable.
Let's stay calm. Just like you said.
Tak! Don't lose confidence!
We've kept improving, again and again and again!\nThere's no way he's beating us!
Oh? So <avatar_name> managed to calm him down?\nWell, show me what you've got, then.
As expected of a top-tier\nplayer.
Ngh, I knew you'd be good!
Did you really think you'd\nwin?
I got him!
Don't know what Ryan saw in\nya!
Stay outta this, shrimp!
All bark and no bite.
Like you could stop me!
How?! You've never been this\ngood before!
You took on the wrong guy!
Oh? I didn't predict this.
Heh. No match for Tsubasa, I\nsee.
I'll admit you've got\ntechnique.
You're calm under pressure.\nDuly noted.
I thought you'd put up less of\na fight.
Simply put, you're no match\nfor me.
Excellent, this is what I'd\nhoped to see.
Oh? Is that all?
Gah, I was careless.
Time to really turn up the\nheat.
Impossible! This can't be!
Enough. I've lost interest.
Wonderful. Better than\nanticipated.
How reassuring... Just as I\npredicted.
How disappointing. Below\nexpectations.
Bring it on, Blake! You're not getting past me!
Heh. I'm comin' for ya, ya punk!
(I rely on my strength on defense,\nbut I lose to Jito in both power AND size.)
(So if I wanna keep being let on the field,\nI need a weapon of my own!)
(Power and technique in perfect harmony.\nMy own style of defense.)
(Back in the scrim, even Jito\nwas getting pushed around by Blake.)
(At the time, I wouldn't have stood a chance\neither. But now things are different!)
Uaaah!
Grrrah!
What the--?!
(I did it! I really did it, Robson!\nI became my own player!)
(You've come so far...\nYou even took Blake head on.)
(I can't wait to play you again, Takasugi!)
Alright! Nice one, Takasugi!
Make sure you score, okay?
Ha! A squirt like you'd just get\nblown away in the breeze!
(That stance! He's going for THAT shot!)
(I haven't forgotten the scrimmage, where the\nforce of that shot toppled me and went in.)
(But I'm different now. I've been doing special\ntraining with Keizinho day in and day out.\nI've trained my body and honed my skills.)
(And there's something else\nI learned from Keizinho, too.)
(You can't just "receive" a shot\ndriven by an opponent's full resolve.)
(You have to counter it with your own, even\nstronger, resolve... You have to attack!)
(That's what you need to be a keeper.)
(Right now I'm Japan's last hope. The keeper\nholding the fate of the game in his hands.)
(Let me show you my resolve!)
I'll destroy you!
Here it comes! Blake's famous Blake Shot!
I'll stop it with a Wakado Style straight punch!
Uaaah!
Wh-What the heck?!
Osu!
Unbelievable! He stopped it! He really\nstopped it! Wakashimazu stopped the\nBlake Shot with a head-on punch!
That was crazy, Wakashimazu! What a punch!
That looked like something out of a video game!
Amazing... He took on a shot like that head on...
Nice one, Wakashimazu!\nThat's why you're the Karate Keeper!
Alright! Japan's own guardian angel!
Tak! I've finally gotten my revenge!
Just make sure you score a goal now, Hyuga!
Darn right! You just keep being\nthe world's best goalie!
Nice, Wakashimazu! It's nice knowing I can relax\nand leave the goal to you!
Tak! I've got this! You just keep up the offense!
Sure thing! We're gonna be\nthe world's best together!
It's on, <avatar_name>!
<avatar_name>!
Show me what you've got!
<avatar_name>!
You can't run from me!
I'm gonna send y'all packin'!
GOOOAL! America's ace striker\nsends it right into Japan's net!
And don't you forget it!\nWimps like you'll never stop me!
Alright! Just keep this up\nand the championship's ours!
Do you really have to celebrate every last goal?\nHave some dignity.
Wh-What's your problem?! Isn't\nthe captain s'posed to inspire the\nteam? Stop bein' a wet blanket!
Talking back to ME? Maybe you'd prefer\nto sit this one out on the bench?
Tch.
Well, at least your better than the other\nincompetents. You're a precious piece to be\nused in orchestrating America's victory.
Try not to betray my expectations.
Seriously, what a buzzkill...
It's reassuring to see that you can at least\nscore predictably. You pass, Blake.
Gee, thanks.
But don't get cocky and start\nmaking your own plays.
Tch. You askin' me to wait my turn?\nFine, I get it. I get it.
I certainly hope so. Now then,\nmaybe I score the next one myself.
What a waste of time.
Alright! That's what I'm talkin' about! We're\nridin' this baby straight to the championship!
Nice shot, Blake. But I must say,\nI didn't expect to go this long without scoring.
Tryin' to say something?
No no, not at all. It's my fault, for being\nunable to use you to your full potential.
Why you...
I just never imagined that it'd be easier\nto score myself than to set the stage for you.\nMy humblest apologies.
If you got somethin' to say, spit it out already.
Ha ha, all jokes aside, the other team is\nfar better than I anticipated.
But don't worry, Blake. I'll draw out your\nfull potential, and America WILL win.
Don't need to tell me twice, Ryan!
Nice shot Blake. And... Sorry.
Wh-What's with you, Ryan?!
It's just that I've been unable to score myself\nor control the game as I'd hoped. In the end,\nI even had to rely on you. I'm ashamed.
The heck are ya sayin'? Ain't this a team sport?
Sure, the guy who scores gets the spotlight,\nbut that don't make you better.
It doesn't matter if you're taking the shot,\nstopping the other guys, or just supporting.
Everyone's good at what they're good at,\nand fulfills a role on the team.
...You know, I may had you pegged wrong\nall this time, Blake.
Ya think? Well, I for one sure love standin' out,\nso I'm always aiming for a goal.
Plus, won't I stand out even more if we win?\nCountin' on ya to lead us to victory, Captain!
Right, and I won't let you down.\nYou can place your faith in me!
Got it!
Goal! America's ace striker,\nBlake scores a hat trick!
Truly, the supreme forward, overwhelming his\nopponents with nonstop pressure!\nCan anyone slow him down?!
Ha ha! Relax Japan, you're not that weak...\nThe great Blake is just that strong!
No one can stand in my way when I'm in the zone!
Blake.
What, you're gonna complain about a hat trick?
The points you've earned are nothing more\nthan the results of my commands.
Feel free to celebrate like it's your own\nachievement, but don't forget\nwho made it possible.
You gotta be kidding! But I DID score those three\npoints! And if we win it'll be cuz of me!
Hmph, even if you aren't the only one\nwho's scored?
If you weren't here, I would simply have scored\nthose goals myself, with hardly any extra effort.
I... We ain't your pawns on\nsome chessboard, Ryan.
It doesn't matter to me who scores the points.
The hat trick was simply the result\nof you having the best odds of scoring.
If you're gonna talk down to me, how 'bout you\nscore even one goal yourself first!
Excuse me, I've been focusing all my effort\non ensuring our mutual victory.
Do you really think you could score without me?\nThat America could win without me?
Wha--!
The important thing isn't that you scored points,\nit's that I let you score points.\nI'd hoped you would understand by now.
Same here! You don't know the first thing\nabout being on a team.
Oh well, you've at least met my bare minimum\nexpectations. I have no complaints.
(If you're not complaining,\nthen why're you dissin' me?)
If I were the only one having a\ngood showing, then people wouldn't\nthink of America itself as strong.
In that sense, we'd have a problem,\nif you didn't stand out a little.
Hmph, whatever. Anyway, there's no way\nwe'll lose after this.
Obviously. Well, that's what happens\nwhen I am your opponent.
(They're arguing after a hat trick?\nI knew it... Something's not right.)
(He's not even worried...)
(I've still got ground to cover\nbetween now and the final whistle!)
Alright! That's what I'm... what America\ncan do! And don't forget it!
Nice shot, Blake. You're doing even better\nthan I'd predicted.
You see that?! I can do outsmart your math, too!
Indeed. I'm even starting to feel\na little competitive.
You're really getting into this, huh?
Still, first priority is winning. If you promise\nto score, I won't hesitate to give you that\nchance. But you have to make it count.
Sure thing! It's a sprint all the way!
Right, here we go!
You did it, Blake! To be honest,\nI never anticipated you'd play so well.
Right? Ain't we awesome?
I'm a little frustrated that\nI haven't scored myself though.
Then why not go give it a shot? I'll help ya out!
Heh. I'm relying on you.
Darn it! Not to him! Anyone but him!
(Wakashimazu let through three goals\nby the same guy... Man, Blake's good!)
(Darn, he's good!)
(But we're still winning! This victory is ours!\nToday belongs to Japan!)
(But we haven't lost yet! And we won't give up!)
GOOOAL! America puts one in the net!
And the scorer is none other than their\nthirteen-year-old captain, Ryan Ortiz!
After appearing out of nowhere,\nlike a shooting star in the quarterfinals,\nhe's displayed brilliance time and again!
Whichever side I'm on wins.\nThat's all there is to it.
Nice shot, Ryan.\nWell, not that I didn't beat you to the punch.
Hmph. That would annoy me more\nwere there not plenty of glory to go around.
Also, I'd prefer it if you didn't misunderstand.\nI let you have those goals.
Seriously?!
Nice shot, Ryan.\nBut could ya let me have some of the fun, too?
Hmm, I'll consider it.\nI suppose you ARE our ace striker, for now.
F-For now?!
On this field, I'm the one who decides who scores.
Just be a good boy and follow my orders.\nThat's how we'll win.
Seriously, what a buzzkill...
What a waste of time.
GOOAL! Is there nothing that can stop this boy?!\nAmerica's young captain Ryan racks up a hat trick!
Even in the finals, Ryan still reigns\nas the Tyrant of the Field!
Sheesh. As far as I can tell Japan\nhonestly thinks they have a chance.\nThey should know their place.
This all part of your plan, too?
Unfortunately, no. If you were more competent\nthis would've proved unnecessary.
Guess you needed me for that hat trick.
...Are you asking me to thank you\nfor your incompetence?
Hmph, take it how ya like.
Must be fun to get all the points yourself.
Not especially. Getting goals is only\nthe natural outcome of my prudent planning.
On the other hand, I'm shocked that our\n"ace striker" hasn't earned a single point.\nI suppose I need to reevaluate your worth.
...Fine, be that way.
Guess we both got hat tricks!
Not even I predicted this. I must have\noverestimated Japan. It seems I still have\nmore to learn about interpreting the data.
This game's as good as over.
I won't allow any carelessness, Blake. Hit them\nwith everything you've got. That's an order.
Fine. I'll use what time we've got left, anyway.
(I knew it, he's the real deal.)
(But even after getting a hat trick,\nhe's arguing with his teammate?\nThat means there are still gaps in his armor.)
(Right, this isn't over yet.\nThere's still time to show 'em what we've got!)
(Incredible... I can't believe they're this good!)
(But... But! Don't expect me to give up\nuntil the whistle blows, Ryan!)
And Japan scooores!
The goal was made by none other than\ntheir beloved captain, Tsubasa Ozora!
The strength he showed us back in Japan is still\nevident on American soil! But the eerily talented\nAmerican team still refuses to give ground!
We're gonna win! Soccer is my freedom,\nand no one can contain it!
Alright, it's working! The soccer we've\ncultivated holds true even in the world finals!
That's our captain!
I won't lose either!
America's not so special after all.
Thanks!
I'm counting on you too, <avatar_name>!
Yeah, I'm sure you'll be the key to winning this,\n<avatar_name>!
I'm expecting great things from you!
No, we can't underestimate them.\nWe need to stay focused!
We can always count on you, Tsubasa!
Let's show them the strength of Japan!
I'm not losing to you either, Tsubasa!
Thanks! I'm counting on you too,\n<avatar_name>!
Yeah, let's show them how much we've learned!\nLet's go, <avatar_name>!
That's the spirit, <avatar_name>!\nEmbrace that energy and win!
I'm expecting great things from you!
Nice one, Tsubasa! I knew you could\nweather any storm!
I guess? I'm more excited than nervous, really!
Let's try to enjoy the game,\njust like Roberto told us to!
This the last game we'll play as a team,\nso let's show America the soul of our soccer!
Right on, Tsubasa!\nAnd we can start with our combo play!
Sure, let's show the world our skill, Misaki!\nAnd win the championship together!
Here we go!
C'mon guys, this is our chance to vent\nour frustration from the scrim!
We'll show them how much better\nwe've gotten since then!
And, y'know, take the win while we're at it!
Darn it, they got us good!
We've been lookin' down on 'em\ncuz we beat 'em before.
Eh, I'll just get us a few points, too!
(Strange... According to the plan, we should\nhave been able to completely counter Tsubasa.)
(Is this not the Tsubasa I know?\nNot the Japan I know?)
He's way better than anticipated!
Don't let it bother you. Tsubasa\nis truly skilled, after all. Enough\nto throw off my calculations.
Whoa, never thought I'd hear you\npraise someone like that.
I'd be a fool to ignore his talent.\nBut that doesn't mean he's got me beat.
If he's exceeding my predictions,\nwe'll just have to surpass him as a team.
Sounds about right.
I'm not allowing another goal!\nSo you guys go get the lead back!
Right. They may be good,\nbut America will win this in the end. Idziemy!
Heck yeah!
GOOOAL! Japan's ace striker Hyuga\nhas fired what might be the winning shot!
The Fierce Tiger's been unstoppable today,\nas if he wanted a little revenge\nfrom their past encounter!
See that, America?!\nThat's the new and improved Tiger Shot!
See that, America?! The Neo Tiger Shot is\nthe result of true personal... TEAM growth!
You're facing a different team today!
Alright, now that we've gotten a little payback,\nlet's settle it and win this thing!
That's why I look up to you!
With your skills, I never had any doubts!
And it's all thanks to me!
You look up to me...?
Huh... Feels kinda good to hear.
You got that right!\nAnd I'm not stopping anytime soon!
Cocky, huh?
You got a ways to go before\nyou're better than me, though!
That's our Hyuga!
Isn't it only natural with your skills?
Don't steal all the spotlight!
No duh. I've been training for this ever since\nwe lost the scrimmage.
Natural, huh?
I sure never thought so. But I have been training\nfor this ever since we lost the scrimmage.
Hmph, if you want the spotlight so\nbad, then steal it yourself. Should\nbe easy enough for you, right?
Nice shot, Hyuga! You really are our ace striker!
Hmph. You scored first, didn't ya?\nI needed to show I was putting work in, too.
That's the point, Hyuga!\nNow let's keep the pressure on!
Hmph. Now you just have to score, too.\nShow everyone how much we've grown together.
That's the plan!\nI want revenge for the scrimmage too, you know!
No way... I mean, it hasn't been that long since\nthe scrimmage... What happened to these guys?
Looks like they've put on some muscle, too.\nIt's like they leveled up.
(That shouldn't be possible. This isn't\na video game... There's no way to improve\nso much in such a short time frame.)
(Were my calculations wrong?\nOr did they somehow surpass my math...?)
Oh jeez, they're way better\nthan anything we imagined!
Sheesh, they just keep comin' up with\nnew stuff. Must've been out for our blood\never since the scrim.
So this is all from hard work and resolve?
...So that's why it's so hard to read them.
Hmm?
I've never been motivated to improve after a loss\nbefore. After all, I've never lost.
So I misread the impact it would have.
Oh, the foibles of genius...
Don't think about it too hard, Ryan.
If they improved more than us, we just gotta\nimprove more than them next time.
There ain't nothin' they can do that we can't.
You're right. In this case,\nit really is that simple.
Then let's go! It's time we collected\na few points of our own!
You got it!
GOOOAL!
A point from <avatar_name>,\nthe boy who's grown into Japan's secret weapon\nover the course of the tournament!
(His movements are unusually adept.\nHe's gained more than skill here...\nHe's found confidence, too.)
(Come to think of it, maybe he's the one\nwho's carried the team this far.)
(Either way, seeing him grow into one of the\npillars of the team does my heart proud.)
Nice one, <avatar_name>!\nYou just scored in the finals!
Yeah, thanks!
Are you watching, Furano?
It's because I got the skills to pay the bills.
Now we just need to ride this\nmomentum straight to victory!
Yeah, they're watching. I'm sure\nthey're as proud of that goal as you are.
Woo! Go <avatar_name>!
He did it!
I can't believe he scored a goal here!\nHe's incredible!
But the captain's no slouch either! Just wait!
Okay! As captain, it's time for me\nto show my stuff!
Ahahaha...
Well said! Seems like this tourney's\nonly made you more confident.
Still, don't let your guard down.\nIt's not over until it's over, remember?
Nice one, <avatar_name>!\nI'm as proud as if I'd scored it myself!
Yeah, thank you!
We can celebrate after we've won.
Don't you need to rest, Misugi?
Before the match, I wasn't sure how\nthis would go, but after seeing you,\nI'm relieved. We can win this.
True enough. We're still in the game.\nIt can go either way.
But if we keep our heads in it,\nwe can come out ahead!
Heh. Glad you've got the extra time\nto worry about me. But don't.
I'm wearing this uniform too.\nI'm a member of this team, and I don't intend\nto just twiddle my thumbs and watch.
I'm going to give this everything I've got, too!\nI don't want any regrets!
Nice! You did it, <avatar_name>!
Let's win this championship!
I'm just happy to do my part!
Easy as pie!
Of course! We'll ride this wave\nall the way to victory!
Heh. You'll only have done your part\nonce we win, though.
Anyway, give this all you've got! Stay focused!
Hmph, now you've said it.
But I guess you really are\na pillar of the team now.
Just make sure you put in the work\nto back up that big mouth of yours!
Were you satisfied with that goal just now,\n<avatar_name>?
Yes! It went perfectly!
No, I could've done better.
There's work to do! We need more goals!
It's always nice when a play in a real game\ngoes just like you practiced.\nThat's when soccer is at its best.
I hope you'll never forget that feeling.\nAnd that it's universal to us all.
That's why we can't lose to America! Not to Ryan!
Yeah. Even when there's a good result,\nwe can imagine doing better. The drive to try\nharder is one of the best things about soccer.
We should never forget that feeling of striving\nto do better and work harder.\nIt's not about following someone else's orders.
I'm sure you made it this far because\nyou've never forgotten that.
But now let's show it to Ryan and the Americans!\nLet's show them what we've trained for!
Ha ha, good answer!\nI'm not gonna let you out score me, either!
Hmm... It's not always just about hard work with\nyour teammates. I think growing with your rivals\nis another of the joys of soccer.
If you leave that out,\nit isn't the soccer I fell in love with.
We have to win today, <avatar_name>.
We'll have to teach Ryan and America\nhow we do it in Japan!
(I can't believe it. HE scored a goal?)
(What is everyone doing?!)
Weird... That wasn't supposed to happen.
Forget it. Be inspired by those who played well,\nrather than gettin' down on yourself.\nIt's easier to move ahead that way.
(Inspired by my opponents? Is that a joke?\nMy orders are perfect!)
(If there's a problem with them...\nIt must be that someone is holding the team back\nmore than I anticipated!)
(Or could it be that <avatar_name>\nis better than I estimated?)
So we lost a point to <avatar_name>...
Oh man! I should've been on top of that!
No matter. He surpasses even my calculations.\nWhich means you should be able to as well, Azwan.
<avatar_name>, Tsubasa, and even the others.\nWhat a mysterious team.
Whoa, never thought I'd hear that from you!
Well, after they've so exceedingly outstripped\npredictions, how could I not acknowledge them?
But that doesn't mean we'll just roll over\nand accept defeat. We're going to\npay them back for this, Blake.
Right on! I woulda done it even\nif ya told me not to!
Azwan, you know how to adjust.\nI expect you'll stop the next one.
Well, since you asked so nicely...\nI guess that's what I'll do!
Time to go, people!
You got it!
And <avatar_name> does it again!
Seems the power of youth is making itself\nknown in the finals! What a hat trick!
As the youngest, his incredible growth this\ntournament seems to have led the team forward!
(Magnificent, <avatar_name>.\nYou've long since surpassed my expectations.)
(I'm proud of you, boy.)
(But I'm sure you're not done wreaking havoc yet!\nMake full use of the time left!)
You're amazing, <avatar_name>!\nYou've come so far! I'm so proud of you!
Can't wait to tell the guys at Furano!
Let's win before we celebrate too much!
You think Fujisawa's watching, too?
Absolutely! You'll be able to brag about this\nall over school, and probably, all over Japan!
Even the finals didn't shake you!
Heh, good point. This won't mean a thing\nif we don't win.
In that case, I'll praise the snot out of you\nonce we do! I hope you're ready!
Well, she's gotta be, right?
As part of the Furano MS soccer club,\nof course she's worried about the new kid!\nAnd I bet she's happy with the performance!
But still, no time to worry\nabout that sorta stuff right now!
You're incredible, <avatar_name>!\nEven as the guy who's been with you every step\nof the way, I'm still amazed at your improvements.
Thank you, Misugi!
It's BECAUSE you've been with me!
So do I get to be called a prodigy yet?
But I can't just leave everything to the rookie.
The championship is so close I can taste it!\nI need to play with everything I've got,\nright up until my legs give out!
I'm just happy you've absorbed\neven a little of my style.
But I won't let you outshine me.\nNext time, you'll be the one amazed by my plays!
That's not up to me. But once enough people see\nyou in action, I'm sure it'll happen on its own.
But watch out, that title is a heavy burden.\nPeople will start to have expectations of you,\nwhether you like it or not.
But... Maybe you can handle it. I'm counting on\nyou, for this match and wherever we end up next!
That's crazy, <avatar_name>!\nYou scored a hat trick in the finals!\nYou're shining so bright it hurts to look at!
Thanks to all my experience at Toho!
It doesn't mean a thing until we win!
I'm the ace striker of Japan!
You got that right! I feel like I've\nbeen watching you since before\neven the Junior Hero League!
And now you're taking on the world!\nKeep your chin up, <avatar_name>,\nyou're the pride of Toho Academy!
Yeah, we haven't won yet. Lose too many points,\nand this will all have been a waste.
But that just means we gotta win, <avatar_name>!
Our soccer is fun, but it wins too!
Hah, someone's gotten bold!
That a challenge from Toho Academy's\nnewest rookie? Never saw that coming.
But I won't hand over my hard-won glory\nthat quick! I hope you're ready!
Amazing! I never thought you'd get a hat trick,\n<avatar_name>!
I'm sure Ryan's surprised, too.
Right, I'm showing him who's boss!
He'd better be!
Who cares about him?
I see. Even Ryan has to acknowledge you now.
All that's left is to take home the prize and\nmake him see Japan for how great it really is!
Ha ha, I know what you mean.
But don't lose sight of what's important.\nIn the end, our goal is to win the\nchampionship and become the best in the world!
Oh, really? I could swear you were\nhaving fun going up against him.
I think facing strong rivals is one of the\nmost worthwhile parts of soccer.
And... you're a lot like me.
Azwan! What's going on here?!\nYou let a hat trick through! A hat trick!
And from <avatar_name>, of all people!
For this absurdity to occur under my command...\nI am truly, utterly disappointed in you!
Leave off! Doesn't that just mean\nyour orders sucked?!
What's going on here anyway?! He's completely\ndifferent from the data you gave us!
You dare doubt me?!\nAre you sure you're even trying?!
Are you seriously asking that?!
You can't even tell if I'm trying or not?\nYour eyes are busted!
Graaah! Sh-Shut up!
(He's right though.\nOf course, I can tell that Azwan is all in!)
(But how else can I explain this?\nHow else could we allow all those points?)
(Ryan... This ain't the same Japan\nthat made it through the semifinals.)
(The one we're up against today is the one\nthat's diggin' deep for the finals.)
That little... BRAT!
There's nothing you could've done, Azwan.\nI know quality products, and that guy is quality.\nMore than anyone else I've met.
Yeah, he's good. No question.
But playing against him is oddly enjoyable.
That means you see him as a rival.
A rival? There's something I like about that.
But losing, less so.
I just... want to win! I have to win! This is\nthe first time I've felt this so strongly!
Let's do this, Blake.\nWe'll take back all the point's we've lost!
Yeah, it ain't over yet! Bring it on!
Sorry guys. I'm relying on you, now.
I'm not giving up! There's not a keeper\non earth, who can stop every shot!
Come on, Hyuga! <avatar_name>!
Come on, Hyuga!
(Right, Tsubasa, you've realized it, too.\nThis is the only way to score on him.)
(This is our only chance!)
Got it, Tsubasa!
My Neo Drive Shot...
My Neo Tiger Shot...
TOGETHER!
We'll fuse my Neo Drive Shot\nand your Neo Tiger Shot!
GOOO!
We'll try my Neo Tiger Shot and\nyour Neo Drive Shot in unison!
Gyaaah!
Japan has unleashed its secret weapons,\nand fired their most powerful shots!
The Drive Shot and Tiger Shot... as one!
Amazing, the Neo Drive Shot and\nNeo Tiger Shot at the same time?!
It's the Neo Drive Tiger Twin Shot!
Yes! We did it, Hyuga!
We really did, Tsubasa!
It's hard to believe I could\nwork with my rival so well.
Good job, <avatar_name>!
That was an incredible shot!
That was like something out of a dream!
It's our connection that let us take that shot!
You're right! I thought so, too!
Nice, <avatar_name>!
We're the best in the world!
That was the ultimate shot!
Tak! We are number one!
That makes sense! There's no way\nanyone could beat him alone.
You two are incredible!
That was way faster than our Twin Shot!
Your hard work really paid off!
Amazing, you two! I've never seen a shot\nwith such intense vibration and speed before!
All your hard work has paid dividends!
Two of Japan's strongest shots at once?\nNo way anyone could stop that!
What was that?!
Yeah, caught me off guard, too.
But still, a point's just a point. Now that\nwe know they've got that up their sleeve,\nwe can deal with it. Right, Ryan?
...
Ryan?
Do you two even understand how\nunbelievable that was?!
H-Huh?
That shot clearly and definitively exceeds my...\nEVERYTHING!
Japan's aces each improved their trademark shots\nso much in such a short time!\nAnd now they're combining them?!
Yeah? So what?
But rather than their shots interfering with each\nother, they're increasing each other's power?!
It doesn't seem like something they've practiced\neither! They just suddenly synced up with\neach other, right on the spot!
This goes beyond any of my calculations!\nI don't even know where to begin!
...
...
And I'm disappointed that you two couldn't\neven comprehend something so obvious.
Y'know Ryan, sports ain't as simple as you think.
Guess you wouldn't get it yet...
Sheesh, we've come this far and you two are\nstill getting ruffled by something like that?
Whoa now, were you even watching?!
They pulled out ammo like that right\nin the middle of the finals!
Did you forget? "Anything they can do,\nwe can do too."
You could even say that seeing them pull out a\nnew skill like that just broadens our horizons.
So how about instead of freaking out,\nyou just remember that we can do anything.
Ha! Sounds good to me! Watch and learn, Japan!
And I know you'll be able to stop it next time,\nAzwan. I trust you.
Trust? Really...?
Got it! I won't let you down!
Don't lose heart, you guys!\nThis match is just getting interesting!
On it!
Wh-What?!
W-Wait, this is...!
H-He really caught it?!\nAzwan has managed to catch that incredible shot!
So that was your secret weapon, huh?\nI'm not gonna get tricked every time, y'know.
Alright! You did it, Azwan!
Hmph. It's a little surprising, but only a little.
Nice catch, Azwan.
But still, to work in unison like that on the\nspot... Their potential is immeasurable.
No! He even stopped our Twin Shot!
But we can't give up yet!
I'm going to take him head on and score.\nI'll show you why I'm Japan's ace!
That's right! We don't know\nthe meaning of the word "quit"!
No! He even stopped our Twin Shot!
How can we score against him?
We're not done yet!
Don't give up yet!\nOur soccer is more than just that one shot!
Yeah, he's right!
It's not over 'til it's over!
We don't know the meaning of the word "quit"!
No! He even stopped our Twin Shot!
No way we're scoring on that keeper!
No way we're giving up now!
What are you talking about? We've\ngot more than just that one shot in us!
Absolutely! We're gonna be number one!
We don't know the meaning of the word "quit"!
And there's the whistle to end the first half!
Here at this final match, Japan\nis discovering the real value of\neverything they've learned so far!
And the first half ends with Japan\nleading America, the host country!
And there's the whistle to end the first half!
These two teams are really locking\nhorns in this incredible final match.
The first half ends in a tie score, and\nneither team offering an inch of ground!
And there's the whistle to end the first half!
Japan certainly isn't playing badly, but America\nunder Ryan's command is just plain better.
So the first half ends with America in the lead!
(America's good. But Japan's a great team too.)
(And it's not just Tsubasa. All the players I saw\nin Japan three years ago have come so far.)
(Every player here has worked\njust as hard as Tsubasa.)
That was a great first half.\nIt really feels like proper finals.
Yeah, that's for sure.
Roberto.
Oh, Mr. Katagiri.
I made sure to give your advice\nto Tsubasa before the game.
Thank you. I could tell from the way he played.
Right, but it's not just him.\nThe whole team is giving me that impression.
Anyway, I've been meaning to ask you something.
So, about Tsubasa. Did you think\nabout taking him to Brazil?
I did.
But there's someone else\nlooking to recruit him, as well.
Huh?
Diego Barbas, coach of Argentina Junior Youth.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
So, Tsubasa could be going to Argentina?
Indeed. I'd like to speak to him\nonce the tournament has concluded.
But we've made a little wager.
What wager?
If Japan wins Roberto\ngets him, if they lose, I do.
So if Japan takes the championship,\nRoberto will take Tsubasa to Brazil?
...
That is the case.
Thank you.
I do regret to inform you, Coach Barbas.\nJapan is going to win.
What's that?
I believe in those players.
Japan will definitely win!
Japan will win!
You guys played a great first half! Your soccer\nis already some of the best in the world.\nI have nothing left to teach you.
Just make use of everything you've achieved\non the way here.
And don't let up in the second half!
Yes, Coach!
Finally, just one more half to go.
And then it's goodbye, Tsubasa.
Misaki...
I know I said the same thing three years ago,\nbut let's end this with a win.
Tak!
You've been doing great against Ryan,\n<avatar_name>.
Yeah, it's crazy how you're winning against\nthe guy who pinned down Heine and Carlos.
He's no match for me.
He's still holding back.
Whoa, look at that confidence!
As long as you can keep disrupting his flow\nin the second half, we've got this in the bag.
It's all up to you, kid! No pressure!
Hmm?
Right. So I wasn't just imagining things.
I've got a lot of experience,\nand gut feelings like that are usually right.
Guess we can't get careless\nin the second half then.
Looks like you've been having trouble\nagainst Ryan, <avatar_name>.
If even you can't beat him,\nhe must really have the goods.
But we're still winning the match.
He's still got something up his sleeve.
Exactly.
That's 'cause you've been keeping him busy,\nand throwing America off their game.
Next half, really dig deep and\nthrow everything you have left at 'im!
Tak! Beating your rival'll be\nicing on the cake when we win!
Seriously?!
I guess that's the kinda thing you can tell\nwhen you face him yourself.
So you're saying if he goes all in,\nthis match could still go either way?
Eh? Then we'll just have to enjoy that part, too!
Exactly! It wouldn't be any fun\nif our rival couldn't keep up, would it?\nI'm getting even more fired up about this now!
You never got a chance to go head-to-head\nwith Ryan, did you <avatar_name>?
Ryan's really got his eye on you,\nbut that's just how it ended up...
Guess we're keeping him too busy to come get you!
I don't mind not facing him.
Ryan won't let it end like this.
Even if you're fine with it,\nhe's not gonna be, is he?
I bet he's thinking he can turn this around\nby taking you down on-on-one.
So when he comes after you, don't hold back!
It's great if you can outplay him,\nbut even if you can't, we'll back you up!
So let it all hang out!
Wh-What do you mean?
I get it. So that's the impression you get\nfrom him, <avatar_name>?
Heh.
If you can sense things like that, maybe you've\ngot talent as a martial artist, too.
Well, whatever. It doesn't matter what they try.\nIt doesn't affect how we play, does it?
Yeah, all we have to do is put our strengths\ntogether and play for love of the game!
That was a pretty good first half, you guys.\nIt's incredible that you're tied with the team\nthat crushed Germany and Brazil.
That's just how good you are at the sport.
There's nothing left for me to say. Keep playing\nyour best, and crush it in the second half!
Yes, Coach!
Finally, just one more half to go.
And then it's goodbye, Tsubasa.
Misaki...
I know I said the same thing three years ago,\nbut let's end this with a win.
Tak!
You're pretty amazing, <avatar_name>.
Yeah, seeing you today,\nyou're definitely better than Ryan.
And that means more points next half!
Soccer isn't about individual skill...
Yeah, the rest of us need to do our part, too!
Soccer's all about giving it everything you've\ngot while having fun! But we're already here,\nso we may as well win!
Don't be a wet blanket, <avatar_name>.
Tak! Your win is the team's win!\nThat's what it means to be a risk taker!
I'm with them.
It's not a perfect win unless\nyou beat your rival, too!
Figures you'd have a tough time with Ryan, huh?
Yeah, we'll need to keep watching out for him.
I'll beat Ryan and win the match!
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Yeah, that's the spirit!
They say "the man who chases two rabbits\ncatches neither," but you might be fast enough\nto catch both.
Soccer's a team sport, but you gotta admit\npersonal victories feel great!\nI know you can get your win and our win, today.
But it's just a feeling, right?
Don't make light of gut feelings, Ishizaki.
Huh?
I've felt like that, too, before. You get a sixth\nsense for these things when you face someone.
If <avatar_name> says so, then I trust him.
Seriously?
Don't tell me Ryan's still holding back?
But wouldn't it be more fun that way?
What?
The stronger your opponent, the more fun it is.\nRight guys?
Heh. That's for sure.
Guess that is why we came to America...
So let's give this next half everything we've\ngot! And don't forget to savor it!
Couldn't have said it better!
You may be behind on the scoreboard right now,\nbut your soccer is just as good as theirs!
Plus, I can tell you for sure that the audience\ncan tell how much fun you're having out there!
I mean, even people in the American seats\nare cheering for you guys!
Just have faith that you're playing soccer right,\nand you'll pull it off!
Now go give it everything you've got\nin the remaining time!
Yes, Coach!
Finally, just one more half to go.
And then it's goodbye, Tsubasa.
Misaki...
I know I said the same thing three years ago,\nbut let's end this with a win.
Tak!
Ryan's been taunting you an awful lot,\n<avatar_name>.
That just shows how much you've gotten to him.
We're rivals, after all!
So annoying...
Is that so? Well, good.
Really?
You say that, but it seems to me\nyou were enjoying the attention.
You've got to always keep an eye out\nfor your rivals, you hear me?
The desire to beat your rival gives you\nthe drive you need to succeed.
By trying to outperform them,\nyou'll play better than ever.
And once you've both acknowledged each other,\nyour old rivals can become your best friends.
Friends who will push each other to improve,\nand who make the game more fun.
I'm just glad you were able to find\nsomeone like that.
Anyway, he got you good in the first half,\nso go let him have it in the second!
What kind of rival would let it\nend so one-sidedly?
Ryan's been taunting you an awful lot,\n<avatar_name>.
I can't help but feel he sees you as a rival.
Really? He does?
That occurred to me, too.
Yes, I'm sure of it. He treats you\ncompletely different from everyone else.
Then it's just one-sided on his part?
But from what I can see,\nyou two would make great rivals.
Rivals will be an important part of your life as\na soccer player, <avatar_name>.
I'm sure you know, but I've been playing\neven with a heart condition.
Now obviously that's because I love soccer\nso much, but in the end, it's also because\nof Tsubasa.
I want to play against him, to beat him. It's\nbeen my motivation all this time. That's what's\nlet me endure all this training and treatment.
You could even say my fate's been tied\nto it to a degree.
If you can meet someone who you want to compete\nwith that much, someone who recognizes you as an\nequal, playing soccer becomes that much more fun.
I just hope you'll get that opportunity.
Now then, let's go make up for everything\nthey put you through in the first half!
I'm sure that's just what Ryan's waiting for!
That guy sure loves to taunt you, huh?
I've been there. That just shows\nhow much he probably respects you.
Maybe he even sees you as a rival.
A-A rival?!
Yeah, Ryan's my rival!
Why're you so surprised? When you're as good as\nyou, SOMEONE's gonna see you that way.
Oh? You see it that way, too?
I've wanted to beat Tsubasa ever since elementary\nschool. I've trained and trained, just to try\nand outplay him when we cross paths.
But I've never won between us.
To be honest, I used to hate him.\nI hated how he was always obstructing my path.
But all those years of trying to get over that\nhurdle, of risking everything to be better\nthan him, has made me a better player.
And now that I'm stronger, he respects me, too.
I hated him so much, but now that he's my\nteammates there ain't no one I trust more.\nThat's how I see it, anyway.
Man, I still find it hard to believe, myself.
Anyway, listen, <avatar_name>.\nRivals are a crucial part of the game, got it?
Rivals help you grow as a player.
And once you both see eye-to-eye,\nthey can be your best friends, too.
I just hope you can find someone that\ndrives you to be better in that way.
Now, let's go destroy that brat\nfor what happened in the first half!
That's what rivals are for!
(What a great team, these All Japan Youths.)
(Everyone, on the field and on the bench,\nis united in trying to win this match.)
(A team like this can't lose.\nIsn't that right, guys?)
Darn it! Darn it! Darn it!
How...?! How did this...?!
How could I be falling behind these guys?! Me!
There's no way! It's impossible!
No it's not! Cuz it's reality right now!
How could my game plan be falling\nto pieces like this?!
They should never have scored so many points!\nThat's impossible!
No it's not! Cuz they totally did!
What was that?!
You were just wrong about Japan, Ryan!
I... I was wrong?!
Duh! Don't you feel anythin'\nfrom watching them play?
They've superseded my models.
That's all.
I hate dealin' with prodigies...
Listen, I'll tell ya. Japan's doing so well cuz...
Cuz winnin' ain't the only thing they're about.
Winning... isn't their goal?
Exactly!
I mean, I bet any one of 'em\nwants to win more than anyone else here.
But their soccer is completely\nunfettered.
They're just out there havin' the time\nof their lives, playing this beautiful game.
...
Each player's out there makin' their own calls,\ntrusting their teammates to back 'em up.\nThat's the game they're playin'.
Is that... Is that even a thing?
By the way, ever wonder how Ryan\ndeveloped that play style?
I can only guess, but...
I don't think Ryan's ever lost.\nOr even felt like he'd lose.
Hmm...
He's a super-prodigy... someone who'd\nbe able to win even eleven-on-one.
So he's never had to work together,\nor rely on his teammates, to win.\nHe's fine with reducing them to his pawns.
And without a rival at his skill level, he's been\nable to easily deal with anything his opponents\ndo. They've all been predictable to him.
He's always been able to stand on his own,\nwith everything going exactly how he desires.
And I'm sure that's why he is who he is now.
I see. So he was too talented, then?
Maybe I would've ended up like that, too,\nif I'd never met Pascal.
I guess I was lucky we crossed paths.
Diaz...
And along those lines, maybe that could've been\nTsubasa, if he'd never met Ishizaki or Misaki,\nWakabayashi or Hyuga. Both friends and rivals.
(Which means...)
Hey, Ryan! How're we going to beat Japan?
...
It's no good. I can't read their strategy.
So Ryan, what're we going to do this next half?
...
I don't know. I can't predict them anymore.
Figured.
Fine, I guess I have to teach ya then.
How to play better'n them.
How to outplay Japan?
Ridiculous. It can't be done.
It can.
We just have to play better than\nyour predictions. Same as they are.
But...
That's not how it works.
C'mon, Ryan, you know that's not true.
I mean, Japan's doing it right now.\nSo why can't we?
...!
Azwan's right.
Tsubasa and his crew are great players, I'll give\nya that. But we're even BETTER players, aren't we?\nTell me I'm wrong.
True... We're superior to them,\naccording to the data.
But... I've never played soccer like they do.\nPlus, the way I've treated you...
...
Do you remember what you told us\nway back when we first met?
That with my skills, as long as you do exactly as\nI say, I'd lead us to being the best in the world.
Like it was yesterday.
So were you lying? You can't do it?\nYou're gonna break your promise?
N-No! That's not what I meant!
Then stop making excuses. Pull yourself together\nand get your head back in the game.
Just give the word, and we'll follow.
But...
Don't you worry, Ryan. We can do it.
You know us better than we know ourselves.
But that goes both ways. We know YOU better\nthan you do. You'd be surprised.
I mean, how long have we been playin' together?
Well, there you have it.
Blake... Azwan...
All of us here trust you with our fate.\nSo how about you do the same for once?
Yeah, Ryan!
No matter what play you want, no matter\nwhat orders you give, we're with you!
We're gonna beat Japan and stand atop the world!
So how about we try it too, Ryan? Don't you\nwanna see what kinda soccer we'll create?
I... I don't know what to say...
(That's right... Every single player here\nhas been drilled for the purpose of being\nthe world's best.)
(If anything, I'm the unqualified one.)
(But they still believe in me...)
...
(In which case, I have to grow, too!\nI must do what is needed of me!)
(And I must keep my promise to them!)
Okay, everyone, next half I want\nyou all making the best plays you can devise!\nWhatever they are, I'll back you up!
Just make sure you're there for me, as well,\nwhen I put something together!
Absolutely! You can count on us!
They've got Tsubasa, but we've got you, Ryan!\nWe can't lose!
Alright!
Darn it!
Hey Ryan, watch where you're goin!\nI don't care if the game's not going your way!
What was that?!
We've still got a whole 'nother half!\nGo cool your head and think of something!
Grr... Don't you tell me what to do!
(It's been some time since I met Ryan at the\nschool, but I've never seen him like this.)
I bet he's pissed that our ace striker\ncouldn't score a single point.
Sh-Shut up! I was just a little out\nof it the first half!
Yeah, yeah. I'm expecting great things, Mr. Ace.
I told you to shut up! Just you wait!
My bad. It's my fault for letting them score.\nMust've upset his game plan.
Never thought I'd hear that outta YOU.
Gimme a break...
I've always been confident, sure,\nbut I've never thought I was invincible.
You'll never improve if you don't learn\nfrom your mistakes. Especially if you wanna\nsurvive in this country.
Azwan...
(How can we be tied at halftime?\nThis shouldn't be possible!)
(According to the plan, we should've had\na comfortable lead by now.)
(How could my data analysis and situational\nawareness have been so mistaken?\nWhat's going on? What caused this?)
(Nothing's wrong with our team.\nEveryone's following my strategy,\nand everyone's performing as expected.)
(So the source of the error must be Japan.)
(Every so often, their play breaks\nfrom my predictions. But why?)
(And more importantly, how can they do it\nso readily? Why don't they hesitate?\nAre they not afraid of losing?)
(I just don't understand.\nThere's too many added variables.)
(This can't be happening...)
Hey Ryan, you got a new plan for the second half?
A new plan? Nothing's changed.
Just stick to my orders, same as always.
...
Is there a problem?
...Nah. It's nothing.
I'll come up with the plans,\nyou just sit tight and listen. Got it?
Guess he still doesn't get how\nwe got into this mess.
Oh, so you do?
Pretty much.
Okay. I can see that, now that you mention it.\nAnd Ryan'd never notice, of course.
I think experience with more teamplay before\njoining the school is the difference.
It's hard to imagine you, the human bulldozer\nhere, putting that much thought into this, though.
Shut up. How I play doesn't define\nwhat I'm capable of recognizing on the field.
Anyway, if you get it, why don't you clue Ryan in?
You actually think he'd listen to me?
Nope.
But still... couldn't hurt.
Fine, fine. Gotta find the right moment, though.
A smart kid like him's gotta understand...
Good work, team. The first half was flawless.
My plan is perfect. So as long\nas you stay focused, we're on the way\nto a perfect championship.
...
The first half, well, let's just say you did well.
I wouldn't call it perfect,\nbut it's within the expected margin of error.
Just don't do anything else embarrassing\nin the second half. Got it?
...
(Still, <avatar_name> was such a disappointment.\nI altered the plan for THAT?)
(Maybe we should've lost a few games ago, so we\ncould see the Illusionary Goalie in action.)
Not having a great time, Ryan?
What do you want?
Guess I hit the nail on the head, huh? Lemme\nguess, that <avatar_name> guy let you down?
Why would I care about how he's playing?
I mean, it always sucks when your rival\nisn't livin' up to being a worthy foe.
R-Rival?! Since when is he my rival?!
(Still, <avatar_name> did surprise me before.)
(But I'm not sure how I ever thought he could go\ntoe-to-toe with ME. What a miscalculation.)
What's up, Ryan? You look genuinely happy,\nfor once.
What?!
It's all over your face. You're happy you've\nfound someone worth the trouble of fighting.
Ludicrous.
Hey, nothin' wrong with that.\nRivals make soccer more fun.
You're saying <avatar_name> is my rival?!
(Still, <avatar_name> was such a disappointment.\nTo think he'd flee from our duel.)
(How can I probe his talent like this? Sheesh,\ndoesn't he even know why I came to the finals?)
Not having a great time, Ryan?
What do you want?
Guess I was right.\nLemme guess, it's cuz you didn't get to face off\nwith that <avatar_name> guy?
Why would I care about a thing like that?
Haha!
For the same reason he would. You're rivals.
R-Rival?! Since when is he my rival?!
I hope you get your chance to\nface him in the second half.
(I... think of him as a rival?)
(Nonsensical! Why would I? I am unrivaled!)
(I'm looking forward to the second half,\n<avatar_name>.)
(Because you're not getting out\nof this unscathed!)
(I've misjudged everything. Myself, my opponents,\nmy teammates... even soccer, itself.)
(I would analyze my opponents, think of a winning\nplay, and direct my teammates to execute it.)
(The idea was to take past data on both my\nopponents and my teammates, put it in a framework,\nand win from within that framework.)
(But for the first time,\nI've met a team that didn't work on.)
(Japan is improving minute by minute,\nand with their freeform thinking they\nare acting outside my framework.)
(Which means my teammates and I no longer\nneed to be stuck in that box, either.)
(I'll trust my teammates more,\ndraw out their own ideas, and show Japan a soccer\nthat surpasses even what they've done today!)
Here we go, guys! We'll beat them with\nAmerica's true power!
Alright!
Halftime is now over, and cheers\nonce more fill the crowded stadium!
Japan is currently in the lead,\nbut can they keep this pace up and\nwin their first world championship?
Or will the host country, America, show us\ntheir tenacity and snatch away the crown?!
It's time for the kickoff to\na fateful second half!
Halftime is now over, and cheers\nonce more fill the crowded stadium!
These two perfectly matched teams are\nlocked in combat, battling in a fitting end\nto this grand championship!
When the final whistle blows, will Japan\nsucceed in taking the inaugural crown?
It's time for the kickoff to\na fateful second half!
Halftime is now over, and cheers\nonce more fill the crowded stadium!
The American team led by young Ryan has been\ndemonstrating their skills, establishing a lead in\nthis thrilling final game!
But the Japanese side has been\nlearning from every match, and they've\nproven that they're in it until the last whistle!
When the final whistle blows, who will\nbe victorious and have the honor of\ntaking home this inaugural crown?
It's time for the kickoff to\na fateful second half!
Let's give this everything\nwe've got!
What's this? Something's different\nabout the American team!
Just pay attention to what I\nsay!
How?! How is this happening?!
Why?! Why is nothing working?!
How could my game plan be disrupted like this?!
There's no way! It's impossible!
No it's not! Cuz they did!
What was that?!
You were just wrong about Japan, Ryan!
I... I was wrong?!
Duh! Don't you feel anythin'\nfrom watching them play?
They've superseded my models.
That's all.
I hate dealin' with prodigies...
Listen, I'll tell ya. Japan's doing so well cuz...
Cuz winnin' ain't the only thing they're about.
Winning... isn't their goal?
Exactly!
I mean, I bet any one of 'em\nwants to win more than anyone else here.
But their soccer is completely\nunfettered.
They're just out there havin' the time of\ntheir lives, playing the beautiful game.
...
Each player's out there makin' their own calls,\ntrusting their teammates to back 'em up.\nThat's the game they're playin'.
Is that... Is that even a thing?
By the way, ever wonder how Ryan\ndeveloped that play style?
I can only guess, but...
I don't think Ryan's ever lost.\nOr even felt like he'd lose.
Hmm.
He's a super-prodigy... someone who'd\nbe able to win even eleven-on-one.
So he's never had to work together,\nor rely on his teammates, to win.\nHe's fine with reducing them to his pawns.
And without a rival at his skill level, he's been\nable to easily deal with anything his opponents\ndo. They've all been predictable to him.
He's always been able to stand on his own,\nwith everything going exactly how he desires.
And I'm sure that's why he is who he is now.
I see. So he was too talented, then?
Maybe I would've ended up like that, too,\nif I'd never met Pascal.
I guess I was lucky we crossed paths.
Diaz...
And along those lines, maybe that could've been\nTsubasa, if he'd never met Ishizaki or Misaki,\nWakabayashi or Hyuga. Both friends and rivals.
(Which means...)
Hey Ryan? How are we going to handle this?
...
I don't know. I can't predict them anymore.
Figured.
Fine, I guess I have to teach ya then.
How to play better'n them.
How to outplay Japan?
Ridiculous. It can't be done.
It can.
We just have to play better than\nyour predictions. Same as they are.
But...
That's not how it works.
C'mon, Ryan, you know that's not true.
I mean, Japan's doing it right now.\nSo why can't we?
...!
Azwan's right.
Tsubasa and his crew are great players, I'll give\nya that. But we're even BETTER players, aren't we?\nTell me I'm wrong.
True... We're superior to them,\naccording to the data.
But... I've never played soccer like they do.\nPlus, the way I've treated you...
...
Do you remember what you told us\nway back when we first met?
That with my skills, as long as you do exactly as\nI say, I'd lead us to being the best in the world.
Like it was yesterday.
So were you lying? You can't do it?\nYou're gonna break your promise?
N-No! That's not what I meant!
Then stop making excuses. Pull yourself together\nand get your head back in the game.
Just give the word, and we'll follow.
But...
Don't you worry, Ryan. We can do it.
You know us better than we know ourselves.
But that goes both ways. We know YOU better\nthan you do. You'd be surprised.
I mean, how long have we been playin' together?
Well, there you have it.
Blake... Azwan...
All of us here trust you with our fate.\nSo how about you do the same for once?
Yeah, Ryan!
No matter what play you want, no matter\nwhat orders you give, we're with you!
We're gonna beat Japan and stand atop the world!
So how about we try it too, Ryan? Don't you\nwanna see what kinda soccer we'll create?
I... I don't know what to say...
(That's right... Every single player here\nhas been drilled for the purpose of being\nthe world's best.)
(If anything, I'm the unqualified one.)
(But they still believe in me...)
...
(In which case, I have to grow, too!\nI must do what is needed of me!)
(And I must keep my promise to them!)
Okay, everyone, next half I want\nyou all making the best plays you can devise!\nWhatever they are, I'll back you up!
Just make sure you're there for me, as well,\nwhen I put something together!
Absolutely! You can count on us!
They've got Tsubasa, but we've got you, Ryan!\nWe can't lose!
Alright!
And America's Captain Ryan scores!
But something's different this time! The usually\ncalm, calculating Ryan has refined his play even\nfurther, putting some spirit into his kick!
Thanks, Japan. You've taught me\nto draw out my full potential.
Heh, this is only the beginning!
With my full potential, and this next evolution\nof how I play soccer, nothing is impossible!
Nice one! You're on a roll!
Heh. Getting honest praise feels a little good.
I'm expecting great things from you too, Blake!
Ha! Who do ya think you're talkin' to?
I was picked to make America the best\nits ever been right alongside ya!
When I'm serious, I'm unstoppable!
Good to hear! We're just getting started, guys!
Alright!
But sorry. We'd be doing even better,\nif I hadn't gotten shut out.
Hmph. As if America's ace striker would\nlet things end so pitifully.
Ryan...
You're making your leader look bad.
Uh, well...
I'm kidding. It was a joke.
Come on, Blake. I'll set you up\nin front of their goal, no matter what.
Then we'll be champions, together!
Alright! Let's do it, Captain!
(After that last goal, I'm sure of it.\nIt's like a cloud's been lifted from\nthe whole American team.)
(But I can't let myself get caught up in it, too.)
(I'll take back what's been taken.)
Goal! America's Captain Ryan scores a hat trick!
He was no slouch before, but now\nthat he's showing something new,\nyou can't deny his fearsome talent!
Thanks, Japan, for providing me with a new vision.
Now, I have no blind spots.
Way to go, Ryan! Ain't soccer just the best?
Yeah, it is. I feel so refreshed now.
But the match isn't over.\nI expect a few more goals out of you, Blake.
Hey, I'm tryin'!
In that case, I'll arrange some. Back me up.
Just leave it to me!\nI'll see you to doubling your goal count!
But that won't be enough to settle this.\nIf we're going to win, you'll need\nto score a few too, Blake.
Tch, I know! I don't wanna win like this, either!
Then, I'll provide you an opportunity.\nI take it you won't waste it.
Right on! Right behind ya, Ryan!
Here we go! From here on, it's a straight path\nto winning the championship!
Oh, yeah!
Man! I can't believe that guy\ngot three points on me!
It's not your fault, Wakabayashi. Ryan, no the\nwhole team, is clearly better than before.
Yeah, from what I can see as a goalie,\nit's like they're more unified.\nThis'll be a tough nut to crack.
Jeez, what am I making excuses for?\nI'm your guardian angel, aren't I?
I still can't believe they scored\nthree goals on you.
Then again, we are in the finals. Both teams\nare naturally going to be beyond the norm.
Tsubasa...
We'll be fine. What they took from you,\nI'll take back!
Thanks. That gives me hope, Tsubasa!
This isn't good... I can't do it.\nI can't defend Japan's goal.
Morisaki! Stand your ground!
You're a part of Japan's all-star team\nand a hardened goalkeeper.\nY'know it all comes down to this, right?
You are Japan's last line of defense.
I-I know...
It's not going to be Wakabayashi or Wakashimazu.\nIt's ME they'll have to get through.
Alright! I'll show them.\nNothing more is making it in this net!
That's the spirit, Morisaki.
Everything will be okay. We just need\nto take back the points they scored on us.
It's in your hands, or rather your feet, Tsubasa!
(Man oh man, that Ryan is good.)
(And the American team has really come together.\nThis'll definitely be an uphill battle.)
(But there's no turning back! We will win this\nand become number one in the world!)
<avatar_name>!
Now it's time you face me!
<avatar_name>!
Now, it's time you face me!
I'm having fun? So this is\nreal soccer!
I'm loving playing against\nyou!
Now, you look like you're\nhaving fun, Ryan!
I see... So this is what\nfighting spirit is about.
Your play is rough but\nfascinating!
So you're quite capable at adapting\nto different scenarios, I\ngather.
Your movements have changed!
So this is what it means\nto put it all on the line!
Argh! I'll go as far as this\nbody will take me!
There's no data on this!\nThis must be what raw tenacity\nfeels like.
Don't even think about\nunderestimating me!
You're uniquely unpredictable...
Grit? Your logic is seriously\nflawed.
Glad to have met you.
I wouldn't have it any other\nway!
I see... So this is fighting\nspirit.
Your play is rough but\nfascinating!
I gather you're capable at\nadapting.
Your movements have changed!
To put it all on the line...\nIncredible!
Argh! I'll go as far as this\nbody will take me!
Is this tenacity? There's no\ndata on it!
Don't even think about\nunderestimating me!
You're uniquely unpredictable...
Grit? Your logic is seriously\nflawed.
Glad to have met you.
I wouldn't have it any other\nway!
You look like a different\nperson.
I'll be sure to win the next\none!
I've no blind spots!
What! How the heck did he stop my shot?!
You always seem to line up your shots\nwith the goalkeeper's hands.
Oh, shut up. I'm just a bit imprecise.\nI just wanna murder that ball every time!
It might work against some trash team,\nbut you won't score a single point\non a real keeper that way.
Lucky for you, I've got something to offer.
What do you mean?
I was inspired by how they play.\nI've got an idea. Come here for a sec...
Can you really do that?
Who do you think I am?
I suppose I don't have any reason to doubt you.\nOkay, let's give it a go!
Tch. That goalie's got some impressive moves.
You just lack power. If there was more behind\nyour shot, his hands wouldn't be able\nto bring the ball down.
Take a good look at me. I can't put\nas much behind the ball as you can.
What do you want?
Come here for a sec...
Can you really do that?
Who do you think I am? In fact, I'm probably\nthe only person that can pull it off.
Well, what do you say? I think it's worth a shot.
Heh. It sounds interesting enough.\nAlright, let's give it a go!
Blake! Now! Let's do it!
Roger! Here I go!
Raaah!
Now!
What do we have here!\nIt's a duo shot from Ryan and Blake!
Even Japan is powerless against a shot like this!\nAmerica shows us where there is a will,\nthere is a way!
We did it! It worked, Blake!
We sure did. That's gotta be\nthe most powerful shot in modern history.
What an amazing shot! I can't believe you\ncame up with that on the spot!
What can I say? I'm a natural.
What the heck was that?!
I corrected the inaccuracy of\nthe Blake Shot with my own kick.
And I put whatever power I had behind the kick,\nso not only is it stronger than the Blake Shot,\nbut it travels on an ideal vector, too.
It doesn't matter who stands in the way.\nNo one can defend against that shot.
I know I don't have the most powerful shots,\nso I borrowed some of Blake's.
Simply put, it's my Analyze Shot combined\nwith the power of the Blake Shot.\nI doubt anyone could stop it.
You thought that up in the middle of a match and\nmade it work? That's astounding. I wouldn't have\nthought you could pull that off earlier.
Heh. That shot will become\nthe new symbol of American soccer!
We'll call it...
You're even giving it a name?
I got it! Justice Blake Shot!\nThe epitome of power!
There you go again.
Blake... Nothing in that name\ninvolves my contribution.
Oh?
You're overthinking it. Justice Blake Shot!\nConsider it coined!
Hahaha!
Well, soccer isn't played by shouting the names\nof mystical ninja arts. If that allows him\nto play at his best, let him have it.
The most important thing is we don't lose\nto Japan. And now we've got a new weapon.\nThere's no way we can lose now.
(What an intense shot. And that\nlevel of coordination... It's not the\nsort of thing you can achieve in a day.)
(I'm happy America was able to discover\ntheir true strength.)
That's it, folks! There's the final whistle!
They did it! Japan has won the championship!
Japan is the champion of the first\nJunior Youth World Challenge!
They showed us and our host country's\nvery own team their strength and skill.\nGive it up for our new champions!
Not that America didn't put up a good fight!\nWe saw some wonderful plays out there!
Both teams deserve our appreciation\nfor giving us a fitting end to this tournament!
And there's the whistle!
Even on this grand stage to determine the best\nin the world, the winner remains uncertain!
It's all down to overtime now.
And there's the final whistle!
America wins! The host country is also\nnow the inaugural champions!
Hard as Japan fought, the crown\nremained just out of reach.
You all played well under pressure throughout the\nentire game, despite us being so far from home.
You must all be tired, both physically\nand mentally. Rest up while you can.\nIt isn't over yet.
Tired? Who's tired?!
I'm totally out of juice.
I know, right? I don't feel tired one bit!
That's just the adrenaline talking. You probably\ndon't even know how exhausted you really are.
Fatigue can really build up without\nyou knowing and hit you all at once.
You're right. We've got to recuperate\nwhile we can.
You know what, though?\nBeing this tired never felt so good.
I agree. If I could always have this much fun,\nI'd go 'til I collapsed every day.
I remember the elementary school tournament\nfinals going into overtime, too.
Oh yeah... Now, that brings back memories.
Wakabayashi, Misaki.\nThe MS tournament this year did, too.
Really?!
Might as well consider it fate for\nTsubasa to end up in overtime, then.
But we won both of those matches. Who knows,\nmaybe overtime is our lucky rabbit's foot.
We'd better not lose any steam just because it's\novertime! America's on our chopping block if we\nwant to be number one in the world!
Alright!
(Everyone follows Tsubasa so naturally.\nHe really is a great captain.)
(I'll leave the overtime to him, then...)
We're heading into overtime, <avatar_name>!\nGet the team fired up!
Let's win this with a smile!
We'll hoist that trophy up, together!
Let's enjoy this all the way through!
For sure!
Win or lose, we go out with a smile!
We didn't come all this way just to catch\na glimpse of a trophy. It's gonna be ours!
Jito, if I lift that cup,\nthen you can lift me over your shoulders!
You betcha!
Let's definitely do that. We won't get the chance\nto play against this exact team ever again!
We'll give it all we've got and finish\nthis game with nothing to regret!
We'd better not lose any steam just because it's\novertime! America's on our chopping block if we\nwant to be number one in the world!
Alright!
(Tsubasa's a natural leader, but\neven <avatar_name> is doing\nall he can to raise the team up.)
(Without a doubt, you all are\nthe future of Japanese soccer.)
(I'm counting on you boys to win it in overtime.)
Aw man, I can't believe we're going into overtime.
I know. The thought hadn't even\ncrossed my mind before the match.
Overtime. This is uncharted territory for me.
We've always finished our matches\nwithin normal time.
(I've also never been pushed this hard\nin my career. I'm not sure how to pace myself\nand ration what energy I've left.)
(Don't tell me I'm gassed! Not now...)
What's the matter?
It's nothing.
...
Ryan, why don't you sit out\nthe first half of overtime.
What? Why would you say that?! I...
Cool down. Recoup. Are you so tired\nyou can't even think straight?
Ehh...
The only ones that have been able\nto score against Japan are Ryan and Blake.
As if you even had to say it.
The goals we have came from Ryan being at the top\nof his game. His strats helped Blake put together\nthose goals. Without him, we're done.
What'd you say?
My point is, we need to let Ryan rest during\nthe first half, and strengthen our defense.\nWe'll stick it to them in the second half.
How does that sound?
Hmph. It seems you're smarter than you look.
Very well. I'll coach the defense\nfrom the sidelines. Do whatever it takes\nto ensure they don't score on us!
Don't worry. I've got this. I won't let any of\ntheir weak shots reach the back of our net.
I'm partly to blame for us\nending up in overtime, anyway.
I promise to not let them score any more points!\nYou can count on me!
Alright! Let's get our feet movin'.\nWe have some OT to take care of.
Stay strong, everyone!
You know it!
The players only had a moment's rest, and now\nthey're taking their positions back on the field.
This has been a long finals match, and it seems\nlady victory is playing hard to get today.
Both noble teams have struggled valiantly,\nand this overtime will be the final test of\ntheir already tired bodies.
But both teams look toward victory\nwith eyes unclouded by distractions!
And so, who will find glory at the end of this\ngrueling match? Will it all end in a shootout?
And the first overtime half begins!
Be sure to have fun in overtime,\ntoo, everyone!
This match comes down to you,\nguys!
I won't let that ball cross\nthe American goal line!
You folks aren't getting any\nmore points from me!
Japan makes their third attempt\nat scoring in overtime!
But the American goalkeeper Azwan\nkeeps up his impeccable performance!
I'm sorry about this. I was supposed to give\nbetter defensive advice. It's my fault\nyou're getting hammered out there.
Quit your frettin'. This was my plan, remember?\nI'm ready for whatever they fire at me.
Besides, keepers don't have the chance to score\ngoals and win the game, so this is how\nI contribute. This is where I shine.
Azwan...
Now, go! I've got the goal covered.
You'd better!
Just need to hang in there a little bit longer.
And the whistle concludes\nthe first half of overtime!
Japan has created an opportunity for themselves!\nWill they keep hold of it to the end?
Or will America turn the tables and win?
The first half ends with Japan in the lead!
And the whistle concludes\nthe first half of overtime!
These teams are in a deadlock! The\ngame remains tied even in overtime!
This has been a match truly fitting this rivalry,\nbut who will break through for the win?
And the teams are tied!
And the whistle concludes\nthe first half of overtime!
Is Japan's fatigue after this long\ncampaign beginning to show?
Or could it simply be that America's\nwaiting to unleash their true strength?
The first half ends with America in the lead!
Just a little more... We're almost there!
We just need to protect our lead!
I think it's too early to be turtling up.
Why?
Takasugi is right. Based on how America was\nplaying in the first half, they were saving\ntheir energy to take us down in the second.
Right. That's the same tactic\nNankatsu used during overtime in\nthe elementary school tournament.
That's when Tsubasa and Misaki sat on the bench\nfor the first half, and went full throttle\nin the second.
Meaning for our current situation...
America is ready to unleash a punishing assault\nif we stick to defense.
The best defense against such an\naggressive offense is our own offense!
Definitely. Trust me, they'll really hate that.
We've got to stay on the offensive\nin the second half, as well!
You got it!
Let's play it safe!
We should widen our lead!
So you're saying this is going\nto be a true test for our defenders!
Tak! Shore up our walls and keep 'em out!
I reckon maybe then we could use the same strat\nas when I was at Hirado, yeah?
Okay folks, listen up.
America's hungry for the win, and they'll come\nclaws at the ready. But we can't fall into the\ntrap of playing passively.
The best defense is a good offense, right?
Well then, how about the strategy we used at\nAzumaichi? It's perfect for times like this!
Here's what we do.
I see... That seems like a sound approach.
I agree. It's a solid plan.\nLet's roll with it in the second half!
Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Yes, Coach!
My bad. I was the one who suggested the\nstrategy, and yet I didn't fulfill my role.
Don't talk like that.
You didn't let them score... we all did.\nWe're responsible as a team.
What he said. It's not healthy to blame\nyourself for everything, ya know.
Ryan... Blake...
I'm actually glad we're in this situation.
Why's that?
Imagine what'll happen when I score to tie it up,\nthen score to take the lead?\nI'm gonna be a United States hero!
You really know how to focus in on the YOU part.
I've never had to play soccer in a situation\nwhere we're behind. Turning this around will\nbe quite the challenge, but I'm up for it.
You let me rest up in the first half, and now I'm\ngood to go. We'll explode into the second half!
Come on, everyone! We've got to\ntake back the lead and win this,\nso we can hoist that trophy high!
You know it!
Oof! We couldn't make it\ncome together on offense.
Seeing how defensive they were playing in the\nfirst half, I wouldn't be surprised if\nthey were saving their energy for the second.
If that's true, we've got a tough\nsecond half ahead of us.
It's not time to back off. If they go on the\noffensive, that means there should be an opening\nfor us to punch through, as well.
Tak! That's how soccer's played.\nWe'll need to feel them out and seize\nthe opportunity when it presents itself.
And we've been given the fortuitous chance\nto be in this outstanding situation on\nsuch a grand stage. I couldn't feel luckier.
Let's give it all we've got\nin the remaining time and win this match!
All the way!
Hyuga.
Tsubasa.
...
...
Hyuga, we--
I know. I was thinking the same thing.
Tsubasa. Let's make "that" our final shot.
With our power combined,\nwe'll definitely bring home that trophy.
Let's do this, Tsubasa!
Hyuga! We've got to score this one!
We need a goal if we want to win.
Nothing's working. We won't score\nunless we have a plan.
Japan's weapon is teamwork!
We'll rely on One Shot, Certain Victory!
I totally agree. Backs against the wall,\nwe need to do what we do best.
Our best bet is to work the ball up the field\nusing connecting passes and strike as a team.
If that's the idea, I've got the perfect plan.
It's that secret move we worked\nout at Hanawa! Lemme explain...
I see... That seems like a sound approach.
I agree. It's a solid plan.\nLet's roll with it in the second half!
Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Yes, Coach!
We've fought the good fight. But\nit's time to bust out the big guns\nand leave it to our ace strikers.
A shot from a true ace is scarier\nthan all others combined.
It seems you've learned by watching me play,\n<avatar_name>. Great suggestion.
Heh.
You know what it means to be an ace striker,\n<avatar_name>.
Strikers carry the weight of the team on their\nshoulders and have the eye of the tiger.
Eye of the tiger, eh?\nI think I need to learn more about that.
You're a striker, too, Tsubasa.\nYou don't need me telling you this, but...
I guess I'll indulge you.
Listen up.\nThe most important thing to take to heart is...
That's definitely something you'd say.
Then, I'm going to be stalking my prey\nand running it down in the second half!
Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Yes, Coach!
I can't believe we've come all this way,\nand the score is still tied.
That's not a bad thing. The situation is just as\nwe imagined it at the beginning of the first half.
True. And it seems like you've\nregained most of your stamina.
You bet. Sitting out that first half\nwas a good call.
And just as we planned, we're going to hammer\nthem in the second half. I've already got an idea.
The Justice Blake Shot has the\nhighest rate of success against\nthe Japanese team, so we'll use that.
That's a bit too predictable, especially for you,\nRyan. I'm sure they'll be watching out\nfor that move.
What're you talking about? The kick has the\nhighest rate of scoring, even if\nthey try to defend against it.
I guess... My bad.
Hahaha!
That's the only plan! Let's win this\ngame with our Justice Blake Shot\nand become bonafide American heroes!
There isn't a goal we can't score on,\nif we bring our talents together!
Obviously!
That's the only reason I entered\nthis school in the first place.
Let's do this, team! We've got to win this so\nwe can celebrate with that trophy\nduring the award ceremony!
Oh, yeah!
This isn't good. Only half of overtime is left.
We're one step from becoming champions.\nHow could we lose here?
You two done being so negative?
Ishizaki.
Take a good look at Tsubasa.
We still have time! The match isn't over\nuntil the whistle blows! Don't give up yet!
Thanks, Tsubasa.
You've been holding onto hope,\nwhile we've been moping.
Heh, sorry about that.
Come to think of it, we were ahead\nduring Japan's national tournament,\nand we lost to the same Tsubasa in the end.
You're not the only ones to lose\nto a Tsubasa comeback.
We lost to him the exact same way.
If we see this through to the end, it's bound\nto work out for us! It has to! That's how\nit feels when I'm on the same team as him.
He really lives up to that Number 10.
Okay, guys, let's do it! It's ours for the taking!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
An ace always has something up his sleeve!
It all comes down to this. Do-or-die time!
And when you say "ace," you mean Tsubasa.
I'm not sure Tsubasa will be enough\nto help us turn this one around.
I'm sure <avatar_name> will understand,\nhaving played together for so long, but...
My experience might be useful here.
...
Tsubasa, you got a second?
Thanks, Misugi.
I've been subbing in to change the flow of games\nsince elementary. I know a thing or two about how\nhard it is to come back from a tight spot.
Perhaps, I could give you\nan idea or two to consider.
Having to change the tide midgame may be more\nemotionally challenging than being on the\nstarting roster.
Misugi, if you wouldn't mind,\nplease tell me more about your mindset.
Sure thing. So...
Amazing. To think that way going into\neach and every one of your matches...
I think you've given me a great asset\nfor the second half!
And I'll definitely turn things around!
Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Yes, Coach!
Do or die, eh? There are times when we\nhave to buckle down and do what's needed.
Yeah. I think this is one of those times.
<avatar_name>, Ultimate Formation\nwas our specialty at Furano.
Ultimate Formation! In that case...
Could I get everyone's attention!
Ultimate Formation was our specialty at Furano.\nLet me explain how it works.
Listen carefully...
I see. That just might work.
I agree. It's a solid plan.\nLet's roll with it in the second half!
Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Yes, Coach!
Well now, this was unexpected.
I'm not sure I'd quite go that far.
Always with the being contradictory...
Look, I have faith in this team, so this was\ndefinitely a possibility in my book.
Heh, now you're trying to sound all cool.
I guess we should change the plan and\nplay hard defense until the clock runs out.
No, I've no intention of running from this fight.\nThe plan stays the same.
You sure?!
Japan is just as desperate to win.\nCan't you see it in their eyes? They'll be\ncoming at us with torches and pitchforks.
They are outperforming their data.\nIf we dedicate ourselves to defense, we're\nlikely to capitulate to a surprise attack.
That's why we're sticking to the plan and playing\noffense in the second half. We'll limit their\nadvance by not letting them control the pace.
We'll extend our lead and take their will\nto fight right out of them.
Good ol' Ryan. Sounds good to me.
You ready to do this, guys?\nImagine this is the final of the World Cup!\nLet's shatter our enemies' spirits and win!
Tak!
This seemingly endless tournament has all\ncome down to this final half. If the score\nremains tied, it all ends in a penalty shootout!
Both of these teams have fought tooth and nail,\nand either one could walk away a winner today.
How will this Junior Youth World Challenge\nfinally end?!
It's time for the kickoff to this\nfateful second half of overtime!
It's time...
Time to leave nothing for later!
G-GOOOAAAL!
It's the Neo Drive Tiger Twin Shot! Japan has\nshown us their strongest shot, and it worked!
The fight for the top is fierce! Have these two\nfinally capped off this whirlwind tale of soccer?
We did it, Tsubasa!
Hyuga!
To be honest, it's kind of a weird feeling.
It wasn't long ago that I couldn't stand you,\nand now we're on the same team,\neven pairing up for a Twin Shot.
It's strange for me, too, you know.\nYou've always been a rival to me, but now\nyou're the teammate I turn to and count on.
Tsubasa...
Everything happened exactly as it needed to.
Which is why now it's time for us to win!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Get ready for...
...the heart of American soccer!
We are witnessing the pride of the American team!\nWhat a decisive goal in the final moments!
Ryan and Blake have scored a goal.\nThey represent the hope of America!
Those two really did it...
Ryan!
I knew it. You and I are the best there are.\nThe best data and the best teammates.
You bet! And becoming champs is how we prove it!
You're right. We'll win the match\nand show the world we're the best duo!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
I can't fall behind those two.
Come on, Japan! Bring on the kicks!\nI'll show everyone what I can do, too!
And there's the final whistle!
Yes! They did it! Japan wrested control in the\nfinal half and has won the championship!
Japan is the champion of the first\nJunior Youth World Challenge!
They showed us and our host country's\nvery own team their strength and skill.\nGive it up for our new champions!
Not that America didn't put up a good fight!\nWe saw some wonderful playing out there!
Both teams deserve our appreciation for\ngiving us a fitting end to this tournament!
And the whistle blows to end the overtime!
Skill against skill, will against will...\novertime ends with no clear winner!
Their fates will be decided in a penalty shootout!
But before that, let's congratulate both of these\nincredible teams on a stellar performance!
And there's the final whistle!
And after this grueling final match,\nthe goddess of victory smiles on America!
America, our host country, was able to explode\non the field and is now our champions!
Hard as Japan fought, they\ncould not squeeze out a win.
It's over...
We couldn't pull it off.
We've still got the penalty shootout.
That's right. A penalty shootout to determine\nthe best in the world! Come on, everyone!\nIt's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!
Tsubasa... You're always so upbeat\nall the way to the end.
You hafta admit, it is a little reassuring\nthat he's programmed that way.
One last challenge. Let's show 'em what we've got!
My chest's a bit tight...
What if I miss my shot?
Let's bring that trophy home.
Why are you so nervous?\nJust take a deep breath. In and out.
Did that help? Now, let's go win this thing.
Tak! And we can show it off to everyone\nwaiting for us at the airport!
I like the sound of that!
At this point, there's not much left to say.
Believe in yourselves.\nGo out there and win that championship!
Yes, Coach!
Go and make your kicks count.\nIf you miss, I'll be sure to stop one of theirs!
You can do it, Wakabayashi!
You've got to be more optimistic!\nThe goalkeeper will eat you for breakfast\nif you're not totally committed.
Wakashimazu is right. You've gotta turn that dial\nall the way up and kick with all your might!
When you're behind the ball for a penalty kick,\nthe goal seems so small.
But for the keeper, the goal feels\nlike it's the size of outer space.
Both the kicker and keeper get nerves.\nEveryone does. So just focus and kick\nthe ball through the back of the net.
At this point, there's not much left to say.
Believe in yourselves.\nGo out there and win that championship!
Yes, Coach!
The higher the stakes, the more the fun!
Okay, everyone! You've got this!
You all ready for this shootout?
Wow, <avatar_name>, you sound just like Tsubasa.
You totally get it.\nWe've got to enjoy living life on the edge!
Hold on now! You're in it with us, too,\n<avatar_name>.
Haha... Ahaha...
You're really something else if you can joke\nin this situation, <avatar_name>.
This is the last chance we get.\nIt's now or never, guys!
Tak! Believe in yourself and pour\nyour heart and soul into your final kicks!
Use every ounce of your being and make it happen!
At this point, there's not much left to say.
Believe in yourselves.\nGo out there and win that championship!
Yes, Coach!
We're out of time, and we couldn't pull out a win.
But we haven't lost, either. We've still got\nthe penalty shootout to settle things.
This is your first time doing a shootout\nin a real match, huh?
Yeah.
There's something about a penalty shootout that\nmakes you nervous in a different way than a match.
The title for the best team in the\nworld is on the line. Don't let the\npressure cause you to slip.
I'm not so feeble that a little pressure\nis going to mess me up.
You're one to talk, Blake. Don't your shots\nalways end up right in front of the goalkeeper?
Zip it, will ya? If I tone it down a bit,\nI can control the course of my kick.
Come on, let's go win this thing already!
You all need to stop thinking so much. The more\nyou worry, the more pressure you'll feel.\nAnd that will lead to a mistake.
A kicker just needs to get the ball in the goal.\nAzwan, you just need to stop the ball.\nIt's that simple!
Alright!
And there it is, the absolute final whistle!
Yes! They did it! Japan dominated the\nshootout and has won the championship!
Japan is the champion of the first\nJunior Youth World Challenge!
They showed us and our host country's\nvery own team their strength and skill.\nGive it up for our new champions!
Not that America didn't put up a good fight!\nWe saw some wonderful playing out there!
Both teams deserve our appreciation\nfor giving us a fitting end to this tournament!
After a fierce final match, it's all finally over!
America dominated the shootout!
These two fierce competitors were even\nto the end, but America eked out a win!
Japan was just inches from victory, but\nsadly just couldn't take that final step!
Champions! All Japan Junior Youth\nis the world champion!
W-We won!
We're the champs!
We WON!
Tsubasa!
We're number one!
We're the best in the world!
The entire team is flocking to Tsubasa.
Woohoo! We did it!
We won!
We won the whole thing!
All Japan is world champion!
Good job, <avatar_name>!
I just know we won today because you were here,\n<avatar_name>.
It wasn't just me. It was a team effort!
I worked hard for all of us!
You don't have to be humble about it!\nNow's the time to be proud and soak in the glory!
Oh, cut that out! You were amazing!
See, even Ishizaki says so!\nGo on, <avatar_name>,\nyou've earned a little glory.
This victory... It's...
The team has hoisted Tsubasa\nup on their shoulders!
Woohoo! We did it!
We won!
We won the whole thing!
All Japan is world champion!
Tsubasa! You really are incredible!\nYou crazy fool, you!
Guys...
This is Tsubasa's victory!
We won because you all played so hard!
No, everyone was a part of this!
Yeah, that's right!
The whole team earned this win.
Victory!
Yeaaah!
(World champs... The dream is no longer a dream.)
(I'm so glad... I'm so glad\nI never gave up on soccer!)
Congratulations, Japan.
All I've left to say is, I'm happy for you.
The championship... Amazing.
I knew you could do it, Tsubasa!
Japan has a team worthy of being champions.
It seems Wakabayashi has redeemed us\nby playing for Japan and winning it.
Sure.
...
Japan sure is strong!\nI'm proud my great-grandpappy is from there!
The stadium is filled with cheering\nand applause for our winners!
We lost. My first loss in soccer, ever.
AGH! We were so close...\nso close to being the world champs!
Auuugh! Why did we have to lose in the finals!\nI can't stand this!
Phew. Feels better getting all that out.
Ryan, you should try it out.
No thanks.
Would it sound strange if I said\nI don't feel disappointed at all?
That's because you did everything you could.
Huh?
It's fun to play soccer and win,\nbut it's still fun even if you lose,\nso long as you played your best.
Right... That must be it.
Let's go congratulate the Japanese team.\nWe shouldn't be sore losers, y'know?
And there are the tears. The incredible rush of\nemotion is overwhelming the All Japan Youth team!
I'm sure there were many trials and tribulations\nthey faced individually and collectively.
But they were able to overcome those obstacles\nand are now the reigning champions of the world!
Japan has won the Junior Youth World Challenge!
Congratulations, All Japan Junior Youth!
Grats on the win, Japan.
Ryan...
You folks were so weak in our preseason match...\nNow, you guys are just as good we are.
We have you to thank for that.\nYou guys really showed us how high\nwe had to climb to get to the world level.
Maybe we should've tried harder at the time\nto completely crush your spirit, heh.
Ahaha. Even if the score was 10-0,\nthe fires in our hearts couldn't be quenched.
Tch, well... whatcha gonna do?
Guess there's nothing else to say\nbut congratulations.
<avatar_name>, today is my loss.
I'll admit you're a far better player\nthan I expected you to be.
Let me congratulate you again on being champions.
I've got to say, you possess so much talent.\nMuch more than I anticipated.
Before the match, I doubted you would be much \nof a match for me. You sure proved me wrong.
Ryan, you were amazing, too.
Ryan, I had a lot of fun today.
Don't be ludicrous. There's no way\nnumber two could outclass number one.\nIt's theoretically impossible.
But I'm happy to hear you say it anyway.\nThank you.
Fun, huh.
That may be the biggest difference between us.
I get this feeling our paths will cross again\nsomeday, <avatar_name>.
And I'll be sure to be ready when that\ntime comes. You can count on it.
Getting a hat trick off me...\nYou really are something else.
Ryan said you were good,\nbut I never expected you to be this good.
We'll have a rematch on the field someday,\n<avatar_name>.
I really, really hate to lose.\nNext time, it'll be a total shutout!
You really gummed up the works. I totally\nunderestimated you, <avatar_name>.
Ryan said you were amazing,\nbut to think you were THIS amazing.
You're just the kinda player I like to play\nagainst. Let's do it again someday!
Now, that's what I call a game!
I'm totally wiped!
That was an intense match!
Seriously, I could use a good soak.
But I wouldn't have it any other way. It was\neverything I'd hoped it would be and more.
Honestly, I've never enjoyed a single match\nthis much before.
I've also never been so tired\nafter a single match before.
Otomo may have their Otomo Quartet,\nbut we've got our own Young Quartet!
You were truly amazing out there. Congratulations.
Ryan...
As I recall, Sawada was the\nsame age as <avatar_name> and I.
And Nitta and Sano were a year older?
I'm surprised you know that.
Of course, I do. I memorized the data\nfor every player in this tournament.
School sure would be a whole lot easier if\nI had a bear trap for a memory like you do...
Seeing players so close to me in age perform\nso well makes me want to battle you again.
You took the words right outta my mouth! Anytime!
Let's be sure to cross paths next tournament!
And we'll win again, too!
Heh. We'll have to see about that.\nEither way, I'm looking forward to it.
Well, later.
Urabe! As much as we enjoy your post-match\ncommentary, you haven't forgotten\nabout our little wager, have you?
What are you talking about?
You better not've forgotten! And I totally\ncontributed more in this match than you did!
No way! That can't be...
I don't normally play as a defender, you know!\nI was at a disadvantage from the start!
Don't make pathetic excuses. Now...
What do I get for winning again?
I don't think we ever agreed to anything.
But who cares! Nothing's sweeter\nthan the taste of winning a championship!
You're not wrong about that! Beating a rival AND\nwinning the tournament... Absolutely, the best.
(Phew! I'm glad he went along with that.)
(But man, that Ishizaki sure has gotten better.)
(He's really become a formidable player.)
Ishizaki! You haven't forgotten our wager now,\nhave you?
Oh come on, we just became champs!\nLet's not fret over the details as to how.
A wager is a wager, regardless.\nI won the bet today... Do you disagree?
Now, what shall I have you do for me...
Hey! I didn't promise anything like that!
That's how it was during the Otomo vs Nankatsu\nmatch. Why would it be any different today?
Ugh...fine! Just name it!
Okay then... Ishizaki!
I want you to run up and down the field\nwith me to celebrate!
Th-That's it?
I'm just paying you back for last time.\nNow move those legs!
Urabe...
I'll run the stadium with you once, twice...\na hundred times! Though that might kill me...
We did it, Urabe! We're the best in the world!
We totally did! I can't believe the game\nwe were just in.
But you know, I lost track of our wager midway.
We had more important things to worry about\nthan some stupid wager.
But hey, we won, so let's just call it even!
Let's just not worry about the details...
We did win the world championship, after all!
We may have lost today,\nbut we will definitely win next time.
Yeah.
Next time...
Next time it's the World Cup!
Ha! Of course. I look forward to that day!
Come on, guys! Time to greet the crowd! Idziemy!
We didn't get the championship\ncrown today, but we will return.\nLet's make that our vow to the crowd!
Tak!
And the America Junior Youth team leaves\nthe field just ahead of their Japanese rivals.
The stadium echoes with thunderous applause\nfor these brave runner's up, Team America.
I must apologize. I couldn't keep my promise\nto all of you.
You better be sorry.\nHow are you gonna make up for this?
I'll cogitate something.
I know. This will be my last game as captain.
What? Are you kidding me? You plan to just quit?\nI won't allow it.
Huh?
That's right, Ryan.\nYou need to accept responsibility for this.
In the next tournament,\nyou'd better lead us to victory.
Blake...
What he said. You're the only one that can\nlead us, so don't you run from your duty!
Azwan...
Today marks the day we begin our training anew.
We've got to train more, get stronger,\nhave more fun, and win the next one, Captain!
That's right, Captain!
You really are the only one to lead us!
Let's keep playing the beautiful game together!
I... I don't know what to say...
...
Okay, I'll continue to be your captain.
So, I ask you to follow me. I promise, for real\nthis time, that we'll win the next one!
Tak!
Alright!
(I've been a Spartan up until now.\nI've only focused on winning, and have been\nguiding the team with that mindset.)
(But leading the team in order to win has limited\nour scope for both me and everyone else.)
(Soccer isn't just about winning or losing)
(What's important is we have the freedom to play\ncreatively on the pitch, have fun together,\nand pursue glory as a team.)
(You were the ones who taught me that.\nThe true meaning of soccer...\nThe true meaning of being a team.)
(Thank you for that, Japan.)
(There'll come a day when I'll have\nsomething to bestow upon you. I hope you\nlook forward to that day.)
Come in.
Please, excuse me.
Is that you, Ryan?
I'm sorry, Mr. Cardinal. It's my fault\nthat our plan for this tournament\nhas produced such poor results.
And why would you think that?
The long-term plan to foster superior\nAmerican soccer is proceeding on schedule.
Hmm?
The overall goal was always to have America win\nthe World Cup. This tournament was merely put on\nas a data gathering opportunity.
And this time around we collected data on a team\nwho will no doubt be a notable future obstacle:\nJapan.
Not only that, but as you faced them, you opened\nyour mind to new possibilities for American\nsoccer. All of this will benefit us in the future.
It's a shame you lost and couldn't seize\nthe championship, but in terms of the bigger\npicture we're still victors today.
So for you to say that it "produced poor results"\nstrikes me as being a little too self-interested,\nRyan.
Understood.
You of all people should be able to recognize how\nwhat we learned in this match will allow you to\ntake the American team to even greater heights.
Of course, sir.\nIt's already coming together in my mind.
Excellent. Then we'll leave it at that.
You must be exhausted. Go get some rest.
Yes. Please, excuse me.
Oh, and Ryan?
Yes?
How was <avatar_name>?
<avatar_name> is an exceptional player.
And also... My rival.
I see.
Thank you. I'll be leaving now.
<avatar_name>...
Yes, it's me. Fetch the head of team development.\nIt's urgent.
Brazil Junior Youths - Team Practice
Alright guys, time for shooting drills!\nKnock 'em down, Keizinho!
On it!
Okay, Carlos, show me what you've got!
Alright.
...
What's up, Carlos? Where's your edge?
...
H-Hey, where're you going?
(Tsubasa and <avatar_name> said their surge\nin power came from their friendships...)
(That's something I threw away when I decided\nto live my life only for soccer.)
(But that's exactly why I can't let this pass.)
(That they can hold their own against me, as the\nworld's best, based on something trivial as that?\nI refuse to accept that.)
What's the matter, Carlos?
It's nothing.
Well, if you say so...
(...!)
Alberto!
What's up?
Time for practice tonight?
...
Oh, sure! Tonight. Gotcha.
(Let me show you how I get things done,\nTsubasa and <avatar_name>.)
(I can use my allies as a tool\nto sharpen my skills.)
Junior Youth World Challenge Semifinals,\nSecond Match, Brazil vs. Germany
Listen up, everyone. Until now I've respected\neveryone's desires and let you guys play\nhowever you wanted.
But today's different. No matter how good we are,\nthis isn't an opponent we can beat with everyone\noff doing their own thing.
The time for each of us to show off to the world\nis over! Against Germany, we need to play as a\nteam! Got it?
Zróbmy to!




...
Leo, there's something I want to say to you.
Huh?
Brazil is going to be unlike any\nother team you've faced so far.
But at our level, there isn't a team in the\nworld that we can't beat. Stay strong!
Yes, Coach!





And fortunately we've got a new weapon\njoining us today... You can come in now!
(That's...?!)
Brazil and Germany, huh?
We'll be up against one of them next, but either\nway, this match is too exciting not to get a bit\ninvested.
So who do you think'll win then?
Germany, of course. Brazil's good, but the\nGerman players are on a whole other level.
But from what I can see, while the Germans are\namazing from the midfield on up, they're a bit\nlacking on the defense side.
On the other hand, Brazil's got both a solid\ndefense and amazing offense because of\nCarlos. I think they've got a good chance here.
Stop fanboying, you two.
Both teams are coming in now!
Wh-Who's that German goalie?
He's huge... He must be two meters tall!
N-No way... It can't be...
That's the Illusionary Goalie, Deuter Muller!
Illusionary?
He was Germany's goalie?!
He never said he was Germany's goalie!
I knew he was special, but this?!
Wha...? You met Muller?!
When? How?! Tell me!
Wha...? You've talked to Muller?!
When? How?! Tell me!
The way you put it...\nIt sounds like you know him.
When did you meet him? How?!
I see... so it was here in America.
Not even Genzo or I ever saw him in Germany.\nSo to think you've already met him...\nFate works in mysterious ways.
H-Hey, Wakabayashi, could you tell us what\nthis whole Illusionary Goalie thing's all about?
Yeah.
In Germany, the man's a legend.
One time, a pro team had a friendly match against\na local team of nobodies in the mountains.
Obviously the pros expected to crush them,\nbut that's not how it went down. It was a tie.\nZero to zero.
Wait, do you mean that...
It's exactly what you're thinking. Muller plucked\neach of the pros' shots clean outta the air.
He kept out the pros?! All of them?!
After seeing him in action, the pro team's coach\nmade him an offer on the spot, but he didn't want\nto leave his home, so he turned it down.
The fifteen year old prodigy\nwho lives deep in the mountains.\nThe Illusionary Goalie, Deuter Muller.
The match begins with a kick off from Germany!
Across the field, Brazil is doing something new\nand tightening up their defenses. Are they that\nconcerned about Germany's offense?
Gah, it won't be easy to\nget into their box like this.
I'll just have to apply a little extra force!
Schneider's still quite a ways\nout, but he's readying a shot!
H-He caught it! Schneider's\nunstoppable Fire Shot was stopped!
Ugh, not bad...
So this is the famous Fire Shot, huh? It really\nis amazing! And is something burning...?
The Brazilian goalie just caught the Fire Shot!
Guess I should've expected that\nfrom a player representing Brazil...
Heh heh, when the opponents turn\nturtle, it's time for my skills to shine!
Heine's footwork is in fine form today!\nHe's toying with Brazil's defense!
Enjoy it while you can!
Aaah!
Alberto explodes in with a tackle!\nHe's brought down the exceptional Heine!
Carlos!
Carlos receives the ball, and is\nheaded straight into German territory!
According to the records, Carlos hasn't\nmade a single pass in his last three games!\nAnd it looks like he's going solo this time too!
You're going nowhere!
Damn!
Carlos slips past Kaltz and goes for the shot!
The shot's been caught! Deuter Muller\neasily catches Carlos's sharp shot!
...
Carlos's shot was stopped?!
So that's Muller.
In the ensuing play, the game was deadlocked.
Heine tried to be the center of the German\noffense, but Alberto stuck to him like glue. He\nwas unable to get in a good pass to Schneider.
On the other side, thanks to Schester and Kaltz\npinning down everything past the midfield, Brazil\nwas also unable to get the ball to Carlos.
As a result, both Schneider and Carlos had to go\nfor long-distance shots, which were easily stopped\nby the iron wall of Keizinho and Muller.
With neither side able to seize any points,\nthe game approached its end with\na score of zero to zero.
And the ball goes to Carlos! With so little time\nremaining, this may be his last chance!
You're not getting past us!
You don't cross this line!
However, Germany's pair of volantes\nare already waiting in for him!
Hmph.
Carlos is dashing straight toward them!
You've got guts!
But that's not enough!
Kaltz and Schester are closing in on Carlos!
Leo!
Wh-What the...?!
No way!
I can't believe what I'm seeing! Carlos just made\nhis first pass in the entire tournament!
And he's slipped between the defenders,\nleaving them stunned!
Carlos!
Carlos and Leo's one-two punch\nhas broken through the double volantes!
But it's not over yet!\nMuller still waits at the goal!
Heh, bring it on!
Carlos!
Something is coming together!\nAlberto has moved up!
...This is it, Alberto!
It's in!
Unbelievable! Alberto's already fearsome shot\nwas kicked again by Carlos mid-flight!
With double the power and speed,\nnot even Muller's titanic strength could stop it!
...!
It was coming in so fast from behind him...\nand he boosted it?!
That wasn't just speed either.\nHe added the impact of his own kick to the ball.
So this is Brazil's number 10 I'd heard about.
And that's the game!
What a dramatic ending to a match that will go\ndown in history! Thanks to Carlos's last\nsecond goal, Brazil is going to the finals!
The Brazilian team is celebrating on the pitch!
However, the Germans are\nexpectedly crestfallen over their loss.
We did it, Carlos!
Yeah.
It went just as we'd planned.\nWorking as a team is what put us over the top.
Same with our shot.
Alberto...
...
Heckuva shot, Carlos.\nThat one-two earlier was spectacular, too!
I determined it was necessary for victory.
I have a duty to win, and to prove\nI'm the world's best. Plain and simple.
Carlos...
We did it, you three! We beat Germany!
And we couldn't have done it without you,\nKeizinho. If you hadn't shut down Germany's\noffense, we wouldn't have stood a chance.
C'mon, it was no big deal...
Besides, it was fun!\nPushing myself to the limit to stop crazy kicks\nis the best part of being a goalie!
Anyway, next is Japan? I can't wait! I've heard\nrumors they have some real fancy tricks.
I can crush rocks with my bare hands!\nHow did that shot get past me?!\nHow can I face Herr Gunter now?
It's our fault for being too focused\non just pinning him down.\nWe didn't expect a pass... He never passes!
Sheesh, how can I call myself the Trickster,\nif I couldn't even see through that?
If only...\nIf only I'd made a better pass to Schneider.
This is so frustrating! How could we have lost?!
Hey, you're not the only one feeling kicked\nin the teeth. I've a reputation to live up to,\nand I couldn't do a thing!
...
Guys, I know how you feel, but we lost.\nWe're not going to be number one.
Schneider...
We did our best. None of you have anything to be\nashamed of. Let's go home to Germany with our\nheads held high.
I can do it!






(I'm sorry, Dad. I was so close, but it wasn't\nquite enough. I couldn't prove you right.)
(But it doesn't end here. Someday, somehow, I'll\nbe number one. So neither of us can give up yet.)
(I miss being a family. We need to be together,\nand play soccer as a family again!)
So Brazil did it.
To be honest, I was hoping to go up against\nGermany. But, oh well. That's soccer for you.
That Keizinho guy is an amazing goalie...\nI still can't believe he stopped the Fire Shot.
That defender, Alberto, was nothing to\nsneeze at either. He totally shut down Heine.
Don't forget the midfielder, Leo.\nHe may not stand out, but his dribbles and passes\nheld their plays together.
And, of course, there's their forward, Carlos.\nThe whole team seems to kinda revolve around him.
I mean obviously they're all good.\nThey might even be more trouble than Germany.
Carlos!
Were you watching, Tsubasa?
I wanted to thank you two.\nI wouldn't have won today, if not for you.
What do you mean?
I've improved a lot thanks to training with\n<avatar_name>.
Didn't you tell me that you'd gotten better\nthanks to your friends? I thought I'd take\na stab at using my allies to get even better.
That's how that final shot came to be.\nAllies certainly are useful tools.
It's a bit harsh to just think of them as things.
You must use whatever it takes to win\nand improve. I realized that from our\nconversation, and it's already borne fruit.
Carlos, I think you've missed the mark.
You don't "use" your friends!
Tak! That's not what we were trying to say!
Don't talk about your teammates like they're just\ntools you use like a screwdriver and a hammer.
Tsubasa.
From what I can see, the Brazilian style soccer\nyou learned from Roberto Hongo remains incomplete.
If anything, your current style\nis just a pale imitation.
Who do you think you are?!
My playstyle was forged in the fires of\ncompetition in Brazil. And now that I recognize\nhow to use my allies... No one can beat me.
True Brazilian soccer will win the day.
It's the end of the line for you,\n<avatar_name> and Tsubasa.
(Maybe from Carlos's perspective as a native\nBrazilian my style really is just a mish-mash.)
(But I've been learning Brazilian technique\nand playstyle from the notes Roberto left me.)
(I've developed my own style\nby going up against all my Japanese rivals.)
(By insulting my style, he might as well be\ninsulting Roberto, all the training I've done,\nand everyone I've played with along the way.)
(I won't lose to you, Carlos.)
(I'm beating you in the finals!\nI'm beating Brazil!)
Alright guys, let's head back and keep practicing!
When we beat Brazil, we'll become the best in the\nworld! Let's make sure we're as ready as possible!
Let's do it!






(Tomorrow, I'll lead Brazil to victory and be\nrecognized as the best player in the world.)
(Is this enough, God?)
(Carlos...)
(Bara may have adopted Carlos,\nbut there wasn't an ounce of good will behind it.)
(Bara just wanted a soccer prodigy to help his\nsoccer club win more. He's just using him for the\nmoney he makes off it.)
(And ever since he was adopted, Carlos has been\nliving more like a dog beneath the clubhouse\nthan a person.)
(He trains relentlessly all day, every day.\nIt's painful just to watch.)
(I wanted to save him, so I came up with a plan\nwith my friends to get him out of there.)
(But he refused to come with us.)
(In our town of Canta Garlo, Bara even controls\nall the factories where the poor work.)
(If we rescued Carlos, Bara could\nmake life a living hell for our families.)
(Carlos must've realized that. He refused to be\nrescued in order to protect our families.)
(And ever since then, he hasn't shown a single\nemotion. He's just a machine that plays soccer.)
(He probably decided that path was his only\noption. A harsh road of training without the\nbenefit of friends.)
(You used to be so bright and cheerful, Carlos.\nAnd you loved soccer so much.)
(I can only hope that you find SOMETHING in\ntomorrow's match that makes you happy.)
Okay boys, let's talk.
Today, we're doing it just like\nwe talked about yesterday.
No matter how you cut it, Carlos is their key\nplayer. He's wearing the number 10 for a reason.
Obviously, you need to watch out for his footwork\nand shooting. But in the semifinals he showed\nhe'll pass to break through the defense.
Be ready for anything from him,\nand as much as possible,\ndon't let him get the ball in the first place.
I can do it!







Brazil's offense may be flashy,\nbut their defense is flawless.
And at the heart of that is their captain,\nAlberto, in at sweeper.
Both his ability to give commands from the back\nline, and his one-on-one ability,\nare on par or better than France's Jean.
And when he sees an opportunity,\nhe won't hesitate to advance to the\nfront lines to help on offense.
His longshot is really ridiculous. He's probably\nsecond only to Carlos. He actually scored a lot of\nthe goals on his own back in the prelims.
So he's more than just a defender.
Sounds like a busy guy.
No duh, dude!
Never thought I'd hear that from YOU,\n<avatar_name>. You know how good we are.
Sure, it sounds tough,\nbut that's what makes it fun!
Offense and defense are equally crucial!\nIf you don't do both,\nyou'll never understand the full game.
Alright, then if we get a chance we'll show them\nthat Japan's defense can play that game too!
There's someone else who's the key to their\ndefense though. The goalie, Keizinho.
He's got good reflexes and more strength than he\nlets on. That he stopped Schneider's Fire Shot\nis proof of that.
That really makes me wanna slam a shot by him.
Yeah, that just gets my striker blood boiling.
Still, Brazil does have a weakness.\nTheir midfield.
Sure, Leo's no slouch, and he does his job of\ntaking the ball and getting it ahead to Carlos.
But he was originally a forward.\nWith the strength of our midfield,\nwe can take him in a fair fight.
If we control the midfield, we can split their\nfront and backline. That'll keep the ball away\nfrom Carlos, and let us wear down Keizinho.
So that's the basic game plan.
Well, that's what we discussed yesterday.\nBut after sleeping on it, I've come up with\nan additional strategy we can use.
Really?
Tsubasa, I want you to mark Carlos.
Me?
Yes, you.
Obviously you want the team to win, but don't you\nwant to go head to head with Carlos too?
I mean... Yes, I do.
In a big match like this, skill is certainly\nimportant, but sometimes these things come down to\nthe mental battle. You can't hesitate.
And the way you've been playing, Tsubasa,\nI know you can keep Carlos in check.
Show him what you're made of,\nand victory will follow.
Coach Mikami...
I can do it!
Don't you hold anything back!\nWe'll be cheering you on!
Thanks!
Brazil's the real deal.\nBut that's no reason to be scared of them.
If you use the skills you've been building,\nyou'll get the job done! Believe in yourselves!
I can do it!






Hang on, guys.
What's wrong?
Let's huddle up before the game real quick.
Oh, good idea.
Okay then, <avatar_name>,\nI want you to give these guys a pep talk.
M-Me?!
Of course! You can count on me!
Way to be. Believe in yourself.
I figured you'd say something like that.
Heh, looks like he's getting into it already!
Come on, <avatar_name>,\ngive it to us!
We've been working together as a team.\nTraining, talking, and helping each other improve.
We may be up against a legendary soccer country,\nbut we made it this far, didn't we?\nAnd we're going to be number one!
How did we get here? By working together as a\nteam. Training, talking, and helping each other\nbecome better.
These guys are suppose to be from the best soccer\ncountry in the world, but we're going to win this!\nDon't hold back and show 'em we're the best!
We've been working together as a team. Training,\ntalking, and helping each other improve.
Even if we're up against the best soccer country\nin the world, believe in yourselves!\nWe'll show them that we're the new number ones!
How did we get so strong? We've been working\ntogether as a team. Training, talking,\nand helping each other get better.
Our opponents may be from the best soccer country\nin the world, but we just hafta believe.\nWe can do this. We WILL do this!
Okay, then! Let's get this party started!
Yeah, <avatar_name>,\nlet your spirit roar!
This tournament has shown us a new, wider world.\nWe've made friends we never would have otherwise.\nThey're cheering for us now.
And we don't want to let them down, now do we?\nWe'll beat Brazil and be number one in the world!
This tournament has expanded our horizons,\nand given us friends we'd never have otherwise.\nComing to America has been a true blessing!
And we don't want to let them down, now do we?\nWe'll beat Brazil and be number one in the world!
Playing in this tournament has shown us the\nworld, and given us friends we'd never have\notherwise. They're cheering us on now.
And we can't let them down! We'll beat Brazil\nand become the best in the world!
This tournament has shown us a new, wider world.\nWe've made friends we'd never have otherwise.\nThey're cheering for us now.
And we won't let them down. Let's beat Brazil\nand give them a game to remember!
Heh, we've really proven\nourselves by coming this far!
<avatar_name>, fire it up!
We dream of winning the World Cup.\nToday's match opens up that path!\nWe can't let glory elude us here!
This is the final match. If you can still move\ntomorrow, then you haven't given it your all!\nBrazil doesn't stand a chance!
Today's match is the first step toward our dream\nof World Cup victory. We can't falter here!
Today's the final match. I want us to give this\neverything we've got, to literally play until we\ncollapse! We're definitely beating Brazil!
Today's match is the first step toward our dream\nof World Cup victory. We can't stumble here!
Don't worry about tomorrow.\nPlay until your muscles are worn out.\nBrazil doesn't stand a chance!
Today's match is the first step\ntoward our dream of World Cup victory.\nThe only acceptable thing to do is win.
This is the end of the tournament. Use everything\nyou've got. We're definitely beating Brazil!
Let's make it happen, guys!
Let's beat Brazil and become world champs!
Let's play like this is the World Cup finals!
Zróbmy to!





















Alright, since we're already huddled up,\nwhy don't you lead the cheer, <avatar_name>!
Alright guys, maybe you're thinking\n"finally, the finals."
To us, Brazil making it to the finals was a given.
But coming all this way will only have meaning\nafter we win and become the champions.
Today's opponent is Japan, and if we just compare\nabilities there's nothing to fear. But we can't\nunderestimate anyone who's made it this far.
I need us all to stay focused and play as a team.\nWe're going back to Brazil as champions!
Let's do it!




Counting on you, Keizinho!
Got it covered!
I wonder what kind of shots I'll see today...\nI can hardly wait.
But what if our defense never\nlets them get a shot off?
Hmm... Well, that'd suck, but what can you do?
Still though, sure would be nice if one of them\nslipped past you guys and took a nice, meaty shot.
Don't you ever get nervous?
Of course, I do. But that's part of the fun.
What a guy.
(My adoptive father Bara added me to the team\njust so we could win today.)
(I live only to win, and become the world's best.)
(Grandpa, Grandma... I'm going to be seen\nas the best soccer player in the world.)
It's about to start, Carlos.
Got it.
Carlos...
Time to kick off the finals of the first Junior\nYouth World Challenge with Japan versus Brazil!
The massive crowd is already going wild!
And this match, which many say will predict the\nnext World Cup champs, is being broadcast\nworldwide. The world's soccer fans are watching!
Who will stand at the top of the heap and be the\nace we adore? Will it be Brazil's Carlos Bara?
Or will it be All-Japan Junior Youth under\nJapan's football genius, Tsubasa Ozora?
You won't want to turn away\nfrom this game for a second!
Or could it even be Japan's other ace player,\n<avatar_name>?
He's been made vice captain for this critical\nmatch, in honor of his contributions to the team!
He's one to watch!
We're approaching the kickoff\nfor this historic match!
Who will be victorious?
Predictions put Brazil comfortably on top.
Still, those of us who've played them\nwill tell ya...
Japan has a true well of strength.
Neither team is going to be safe\nletting down their guards\nuntil the final whistle!
(Finals. Each time we've seen a competition\nthrough to this point, it's felt magnificent.)
(There is no tomorrow. We must\nplay with all that we are today.)
(And this is the most important\nfinals match we've made it to yet!)
Let's have a good, clean game.
Yeah, let's do our best.
I'll be showing my full power today.\nLook forward to it, you two.
I won't lose to you, Carlos.
Let's have a good, clean game.
Yeah, of course.
Just as promised, I'll be showing you true\nBrazilian soccer. Look forward to it, you two.
Let's all do our best.
And I can't wait to see it!
Don't go too hard on us.
Yeah, that I can promise.\nBut we'll be the ones winning.
Heh.
Sure. We'll show you just what it means\nto carry on the tradition of Brazilian soccer.
Let me give you a word of advice. There's no\nplace for that kind of softness on the field.
None of us would ever consider holding back today.
Wakabayashi!
Oh, is that...?
Schneider! And Kaltz!
...
Good luck out there, Wakabayashi!
(So they're cheering me on, too.)
(I won't let you guys down.)
(Having studied in Germany and grown up alongside\nyou, I'll win this for you! And for Germany!)
(In the scrimmages, the shame of our loss against\nGermany, against Schneider, was what galvanized us\nas team, and made us train harder.)
(But to be honest, I was hoping they'd be\nthe team staring back at us in the finals.)
(I really wanted to get a bit of pay back,\nbut oh well.)
(I can't let my personal feelings get in the way.\nI'm here today for the team,\nso we can win and become number one.)
(I'm better than I was back then. I'll stop\nBrazil's offense dead! This day is for us!)
(What's going on? The Japanese goalie\nis making such a scary face...)
(It's hard to believe he enjoys this.)
(Seriously? I'm playing in the world championship\nmatch? Not Wakabayashi or Wakashimazu?\nAnd up against BRAZIL?)
(If we lose here and lose the championship,\nit'll be all my fault...)
(Hah... Oh man,\nI kinda wish I could run away right now...)
You okay, Morisaki?
Tsubasa! <avatar_name>!
Don't be so nervous.
C'mon, try to have some fun!
Uh...?
Have fun?
<avatar_name>'s right.
I mean, you get to play in the finals against\nBrazil? Isn't that like a dream come true?
Tsubasa, <avatar_name>...
(A dream come true...?)
(That's right, isn't it? Back when\nI first started soccer, I used to\ndream about matches like this.)
(And today is a dream come true... but I wanted\nto run away from it! What was I thinking?!)
You're right! My dream's finally coming true,\nso I should at least enjoy it!
That's the spirit! I can't wait to see\nyou give it your all, Morisaki!
It'll be a heckuva show!
Hey, Tsubasa.
What's up?
Roberto's connected to both Japan and Brazil,\nright? And this match is being broadcast all over\nthe world, so he must be watching, right?
I would expect so.
So, uh... Can I ask you a favor?
Yes?
Could you score off of one of my passes?
Huh?
C'mon, I may not be as awesome as you,\nbut he taught me, too!
I couldn't do anything right back then,\nbut I wanna show him how much I've grown!
Ishizaki...
Sure, no problem! I'll be waiting for that pass!
Thanks, man. I'm counting on you!
But while we're at it, how about I\npass it to you, and you can score?
Bwuh?! Me?!
Sure, why not?\nIf you see an opening, take your shot.
Okay... I will!
(This match will decide the whole tournament.)
(As a forward, obviously I wanna score\na goal myself. That's nothing new.)
(But more than that, I wanna win.\nI wanna be a champion. Nothing outweighs that.)
(So if I get a chance to score, I'll take it,\nbut I can't forget my team. If someone else has\nbetter shot, I'll pass it to him.)
(That's my new style. And my duty to my team.)
Sorimachi's looking sharp.
Yeah, he's really taking our advice to heart.\nI hope it works out, today.
Roberto, I was hoping you'd come.
It's you...
So, about Tsubasa. Did you think\nabout taking him to Brazil?
I did.
But there's someone else\nlooking to recruit him, as well.
Huh? Who?
Diego Barbas, coach of Argentina Junior Youth.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
So, Tsubasa could be going to Argentina?
Indeed. I'd like to speak to him\nonce the tournament has concluded.
But we've made a little wager.
What wager?
If Japan wins Roberto\ngets him, if they lose, I do.
So if Japan takes the championship,\nRoberto will take Tsubasa to Brazil?
...
That's the agreement.
My thanks.
I do regret to inform you, Coach Barbas.\nJapan is going to win.
You can't be serious.
Japan will win!
Here I come, Brazil! \nHere I come, Carlos!
Bring it on, Tsubasa.
Wowie, that's a fierce one!
Wow, that's some curveball\nyou've got there!
How'd you come up with that\ncombination?
Whoa, isn't it scary to jump\nso high?
Ooh, my arm's got a bit of\na tingle from that one.
I'm shaking! I'm really shaking!\nHow delightful!
Nice spin! That's good enough\neven for Brazil!
What an impact...\nWhat a marvelous feeling.
Amazing...! Did that just \naccelerate as it fell?
Oh, I get it! Simple but\nclever!
Nice speed, man! Fast feet\nand faster shots!
Sorry, Keizinho.\nWe keep letting them get off shots.
No problem, man. I'd be bored if I had nothing to\ndo. It's great how many kinds of shots I'm seeing!
So, what'll you show me next, Japan?\nServe me up something new!
Heh. Well, there is a reason\nwe left the goal to you.
Ha! Like I could ever surrender\nsuch a fun position to anyone else!
What a weird guy.
That's for sure. I've gone up against a lot of\ngoalies, but I've never met anyone like him.
If he loves soccer that much,\nmaybe he's the one most like you, Tsubasa.
Hmm?
Yeah. The way he loves to battle it out\nwith the best of opponents...
Oh, I see... The way a goalie enjoys it is pretty\ndifferent from a player running the field,\nbut I guess they have similar roots.
In which case, I can't let him have all the fun!
Heh. Figured you'd say something like that.
Alright, let's do it!
Wow... I can't believe he's having\nthat much fun just blocking shots.
I guess there are many ways to enjoy soccer.
So this is Tsubasa Ozora...!
Impossible! We're evenly\nmatched?!
So this is Brazil's number 10...\n!
Let me show you my own\nBrazilian soccer!
How is he keeping up with me?!
This is TRUE Brazilian soccer!
I'm never backing down!
That still wasn't enough?
Remember, you're no match for\nme.
Better than I expected,\nTsubasa.
Ugh, wouldn't have expected\nanything less!
I'm going to beat you, Carlos!
You came after Brazil with\nthat sad show?
I won't lose to you! Not you!
So was that all he's got?
Get an eyeful of my South\nAmerican style!
You've gotta do more than copy\nBrazil!
I won't lose, not even to\nBrazil!
Hmph, guess you're not at\nCarlos's level.
Not even Brazil's number 10\ncan stop me!
Seems you lack finesse.
I'll win no matter who I'm up\nagainst!
He's matching me in power?!
So now it's brute force?\nBrazil won't lose to cheap\ntricks!
Japan's about more than just\nTsubasa!
Your weakness is as plain as\nday!
So their team is more than\njust Tsubasa...
So this is Brazil's ace, huh?
Tch, so they have some ammo\naside from Tsubasa.
Guess you're not the captain\nfor nothing!
My technique is unrivaled!
Your technique's not half-bad!
Defenders can fight back, too!
So you're playing offense, as well?\nI can respect that!
So this is Brazil's libero,\nhuh?
What in the...!
Who... Who is this guy?
I suppose I should've expected\nthis.
I won't be stopped here!
Fantastic technique!
He's even better than me?!
Better than I expected.
This is TRUE Brazilian soccer!
So this is <avatar_name>.
<avatar_name>.
I'm sure my reputation\nprecedes me.
Ugh, so Carlos wasn't worrying\nover nothing?
I guess Carlos overestimated\nyou!
Not bad, <avatar_name>!
What's wrong? You were better\nin practice!
And it's in! Carlos, Brazil's ace,\nhas scored in every game of the tournament!
But for the boy who bears the weight of Brazil's\nlegend, no doubt this is just one more step toward\nthe championship!
Nice one, Carlos!
Alright! That's our ace!
Indeed.
Okay, keep it up, Carlos!
Understood. I have more points to score.
(Aw, man... Carlos got us...)
(This is what it means to be Brazil's number 10,\nTsubasa.)
(Both as a number 10 and in this game, I win.)
(With that number, on that uniform,\nI knew he wouldn't be an easy adversary.)
(You may have beaten me to a goal, Tsubasa,\nbut you will repaid with interest.)
(You have yet to witness\nthe true might of Brazil's number 10.)
(He wears a legendary uniform, so of course,\nhe's going to be good.)
(If I'm going to battle it out in Brazil\nnext year, there's no way I can lose here.)
(So I tried to put in as much\neffort as I'd need to face you.)
(I'll show you that I can take you on\nand lead my team to victory!)
(I know Roberto is somewhere out there, watching\nthis. I need to show him how far I've come!)
(And to do that, I need to win this match.\nTo beat HIM. We need to show Roberto a win!)
And Carlos scores again! That makes a hat trick!
Truly, the ace of Brazil! No one could be\nmore worthy of such distinction!
(Did you see that, world? That's who I am.)
Alright, Carlos! A hat trick!
Yes.
Way to go! I was so happy\nI had to come over from the goal!
I know what you're feeling, but it's not\nover yet. You're needed back in goal.
Don't be cold! It gets lonely watching\nyou guys from over there, y'know.
Focus, Keizinho. If we lose after what Carlos has\nachieved already, then that's definitely on us.
Fine! Fine! I get it!
But sorry. Even if I buckle down extra hard now,\nthe game feels like it might be over.
Yeah, I'm sorry Carlos.\nOur defense has let you down.
It doesn't matter.\nI just need to score more goals.
Leo, keep those passes coming.
Gotcha. Leave it to me.
(Did you see that, Tsubasa?\nThis is what it means to be Brazil's ace.)
(I live only for soccer...\nNo, soccer lets me live.)
(There's no way I could lose to someone like you,\nwho spends all his time dreaming.)
(Carlos... You're definitely something.)
(But you're completely different from the\nBrazilian number 10, who I look up to.)
(I don't want to lose to someone like you.\nWe're definitely winning this match!)
(It seems you know how to make\ngreat use of your teammates, Tsubasa.\nBut I aim to win this my own way.)
(As someone who can only live through soccer,\nI must prove that my way is correct.)
(This is not the battle I lose. Not to you.)
(Carlos, you're definitely amazing.\nBut in soccer, that's not enough.)
(You're part of a team. It's about supporting\nyour teammates and accepting their help.)
(I won't lose to a style of play that just\nmanipulates teammates for one's own ends!)
(Tsubasa, you may've started out ahead,\nbut the game isn't over yet.)
(I have plenty of time to prove that I'm better\nthan you by leading Brazil to victory.)
(I need to make everyone understand that\nBrazil and I are the greatest in the world.)
(Carlos... It doesn't seem like soccer is fun for\nyou, or that you enjoy playing alongside your\nteammates.)
(Is the Brazilian soccer you talk about really so\ntragic? Pursuing victory because that's all there\nis?)
(Because if that's soccer to you, let me tell you\nsomething. Soccer should be fun, and you should be\nable to enjoy it with friends!)
And Brazil's Captain Alberto shows his worth\nas a libero once again!
That shot's made the statement "Carlos isn't our\nonly offense!" A splendid goal from Alberto!
We're staking the pride of Brazil on this match,\nso there's no way we'll lose!
Nice shot, Alberto!
That's our captain!\nCool on both attack and defense!
I wonder if I could do something that awesome,\nif I ran out there?
Could you not do anything insane in an important\nmatch like this? I want you to focus on guarding\nthe goal.
Aw, fine... But I think a goalie who went on\noffense when they got the chance would be\npretty cool though...
The match isn't over, guys! I don't want\nanyone losing focus for even a split second!
You got it!




(So that's Brazil's captain...)
(Even after scoring he doesn't get too excited\nand focuses on motivating the team. Maybe I\ncould learn a thing or two from his example.)
A goal for Brazil!
And the one who made it is Leo,\nCarlos's most ardent supporter!
Hey, I'm representing Brazil, too!\nI can mix it up when I need to!
Nice one, Leo! It's awesome that\nyou got to score a goal in the finals!
I mean, I am a forward, you know!
Now, Japan will be forced\nto keep an eye on you, too, Leo.
Yeah, hopefully Carlos gets some room to breathe.
Alright guys, let's keep up\nthe momentum Leo's built!
For sure!\nWe're riding this wave all the way to victory!
Tak!




Nice goal, Leo.
He may be in a championship match on the world\nstage, but this boy seems to turn even his nerves\ninto a source of strength!
Back when he was just another soccer-loving\nscamp, Tsubasa Ozora used to speak of his\nadmiration for Brazil, and look at him today!
Alright! We did it, guys!
High five, Tsubasa! And against Brazil, too!
Tak! I owe so much to so many.
To Roberto, who taught me soccer,\nand all my rivals who helped me grow!
Can't forget all my amazing teammates like you,\nMisaki!
Thanks for saying so.
But I doubt Brazil will go down without a fight.
Yeah, I agree.
High five, Tsubasa! And against Brazil, too!
Tak! I owe so much to so many.
To Roberto, who taught me soccer,\nand all my rivals who helped me grow!
Can't forget all my amazing teammates like you,\nMisaki!
Thanks for saying so.
But we're not in the clear yet.\nWe need more goals and to keep our goal safe.
This may be the Brazil I've always admired...\nBut it's time to forge ahead!
He really never changes, not even in the finals.\nIt's kind of reassuring.
(I'm finally skilled enough I can\nscore on Brazil. I've come so far...)
(It's all thanks to Roberto's lessons, all the\nrivals I've had, and my amazing teammates.)
(But the Brazil I know won't go down so easily.)
(And Carlos remains capable of anything.)
(He's not the type to take this lying down.)
(Tsubasa Ozora. So you've finally scored, too?)
(You're an adequate player, but these finals are\nmore than just about winning or losing the game.\nYou and I must settle a score.)
(The soccer field is the one place\nI will not be defeated.)
(Inconceivable. He scored a goal before me?)
(But Tsubasa Ozora,\nyou will definitely lose this match.)
(I'd bet my jersey on it.)
And it's in! Japan's Tsubasa is in perfect form\ntoday! With three goals, he's pulled off\na hat trick!
With his current momentum, can even the\nimpressive Brazilian team stop him now?
(Are you watching this, Roberto?\nThis is how much I've grown in Japan!)
Sorry, if only I'd been more on top of things.
What's done is done.\nLet's just think about taking back the lead.
We're going to push for points by sending\nas many balls Carlos's way as we can.
Well, you heard him, Carlos.\nI'll support you the best I can.
...
Carlos?
(Am I... being beaten? By another number 10?)
(No, of course not. That's not possible.)
(Watch me, Tsubasa.\nTime to bring out the big guns.)
(That glare... Carlos.)
(Oh, I see. He's finally feeling the pressure.\nHe's getting ready for a showdown.)
(Interesting. Well, I accept your challenge.)
(Tsubasa, I'll admit that you have true skill.)
(But my pride will not allow you\nto progress any further.)
(I will not lose to you today.)
(Today's my day, Carlos.)
(Sure, your soccer is amazing. But it's not the\nsoccer I love. The kind of play I idolize.)
(I'll beat you with the soccer Roberto taught me.\nI'll prove that I'm right!)
I'm not giving up! There's not a keeper\non earth, who can stop every shot!
Come on, Hyuga! <avatar_name>!
Come on, Hyuga!
(Right, Tsubasa, you've realized it, too.\nThis is the only way to score on him.)
(This is our only chance!)
C'mon, Tsubasa!
My Neo Drive Shot...
My Neo Tiger Shot...
TOGETHER!


We'll fuse my Neo Drive Shot\nand your Neo Tiger Shot!
Gooo!
We'll try my Neo Tiger Shot and\nyour Neo Drive Shot in unison!
Gyaaah!
Japan has unleashed its secret weapons,\nand fired their most powerful shots!
The Drive Shot and Tiger Shot... as one!
Amazing, the Neo Drive Shot and\nNeo Tiger Shot at the same time?!
It's the Neo Drive Tiger Twin Shot!
Yes! We did it, Hyuga!
We really did!
It's hard to believe I could\nwork with my rival so well.
Good job, <avatar_name>!
That was an incredible shot!
That was like something out of a dream!
It's our connection that let us take that shot!
That was my feeling, too.
Good one, <avatar_name>!
We're the best in the world!
That was the ultimate shot!
Tak! We are number one!
That makes sense! There's no way\nanyone could beat him alone.
You two are incredible!
That was way faster than our\nTwin Shot, or Tsubasa and Misaki's!
Your hard work really paid off!
That was amazing, guys!
That was way faster than our Twin Shot!
That was your hard work paying off!
Two of Japan's strongest shots at once?\nNo way anyone could stop that!
W-Wow... I never thought\nI'd see a shot like that... 
Japan had a trick like that up their sleeve?
Don't let it shake you.\nA point is a point no matter how fancy it looks.
Alberto...
Just stay cool. Our defense won't\nlet them have another chance like that.
If they get a point, then we go get one.\nThat's all.
Don't change anything.\nJust keep giving me the ball and we'll score.
S-Sure thing, Carlos. Knew we could count on you.
You all heard that! Just keep passing it up to\nCarlos! We only need to stay ahead by one to win!
You got it!




Wh-What?!
W-Wait, this is...!
H-He caught it?! I can't believe my eyes!\nKeizinho just caught that amazing shot!
That! Was! Awesome! Not only did I get to see an\nunbelievable shot, I got to catch it too!\nIt doesn't get better than that!
Nice catch, Keizinho!
Yeah, I knew we could count on you, man!
No! He even stopped our Twin Shot!
But we can't give up yet!
I'm going to take him head on and score.\nI'll show you why I'm Japan's ace!
That's right! We don't know\nthe meaning of the word "quit"!
No! He even stopped our Twin Shot!
How can we score against him?
It ain't over 'til it's over!
Don't give up yet!\nOur soccer is more than just that one shot!
Yeah, he's right!
It's not over 'til it's over!
We don't know the meaning of the word "quit"!
No! He even stopped our Twin Shot!
How are we supposed to score with him in goal?
No way we're giving up now!
What are you talking about? We've\ngot more than just that one shot in us!
Absolutely! We're gonna be number one!
We don't know the meaning of the word "quit"!
It's in! It's in!
Ishizaki managed to score against Brazil!\nWho could've predicted this?!
And who could make the assist\nbut his long-time friend, Tsubasa Ozora!
Having fought together in both elementary and\nmiddle school championships, they've now managed\nto wrench a point away from Brazil!
I did it! I did it, Mom! I scored a point\nin the finals in front of the whole world!
Nice, Ishizaki! I knew you had it in you!
Tak! Couldn't have done it\nwithout your assist though!
Nah, that was all you. I know you've worked\nharder than anyone to get this far.\nYou've earned this.
Ha! I appreciate the sentiment.
Still though, I can't believe someone who used\nto be as bad as me managed to score a goal\nin the world finals.
This would've been unthinkable if I hadn't met\nyou and Roberto back in the day.
Hey, you're not the only one.\nI doubt I'd have made it this far,\nif I hadn't met you and Roberto either.
Don't ya think Roberto must be watching us right\nnow? I'm sure he's somewhere cheering for us!
I sure hope so.
He's definitely watching us, Ishizaki.
Hmm?
Actually...
Oh, I see! Then he's definitely\ngrinning ear to ear right now!
He's probably holding back some tears behind his\nsunglasses, too. And saying stuff like\n"I've just got something in my eye."
Haha, you might be right!
...
What's wrong, Roberto?
It's nothing. Just got a little dust in my eye.
(Heh. That excuse doesn't really work\nwhen you're wearing sunglasses, you know.)
(Tsubasa's pass was as excellent as you'd expect,\nbut that shot from Ishizaki...)
(The Ishizaki I knew had plenty of guts,\nbut you couldn't exactly call him a great player.)
(I never imagined that you'd one day play at this\nlevel and score a goal on Brazil.)
(Tsubasa's not the only one who's grown.\nYou must've trained hard, Ishizaki.\nAnd you've come so far...)
It's in! That's our boy, the pride of Japan,\nCaptain Tsubasa!
And who could make the assist but his close\nfriend since elementary school, Ryo Ishizaki!
Nice assist, Ishizaki!
I knew you could do it, Tsubasa!
The way you were so serious before the match was\ninfectious. It made me try harder.
Thanks, man. For fulfilling my crazy wish.
No problem.
You know how bad I was at soccer, right Tsubasa?
I can't believe I've come so far since then.\nI just gave you an assist in front of\nthe whole world!
It's all cuz I met you and Roberto\nway back in the day.
If we hadn't met...\nI might not have stuck with soccer this long.
Hey, you're not the only one. I wouldn't have\nmade it this far, if I hadn't met you two either.
Roberto was always especially\ninterested in you though.
If he saw you now,\nI bet he'd be crying tears of happiness.
Well... if Roberto is crying, it must be\nfrom seeing how far Ishizaki and I have come!
He's definitely watching us, Ishizaki.
Hmm?
Actually...
Oh, I see! Then he's definitely\ngrinning ear to ear right now!
He's probably holding back some tears behind his\nsunglasses, too. And saying stuff like\n"I've just got something in my eye."
Ha! You might be right!
...
What's wrong, Roberto?
It's nothing. Just got a little dust in my eye.
(Heh. That excuse doesn't really work\nwhen you're wearing sunglasses, you know.)
(You really are amazing, Tsubasa. You've become\nexactly the kind of player I imagined.)
(But what really shocked me was Ishizaki's pass.)
(The Ishizaki I knew had plenty of guts,\nbut you couldn't exactly call him a great player.)
(I never imagined that you'd one day play at this\nlevel and score a goal on Brazil.)
(Tsubasa's not the only one who's grown.\nYou must've trained hard, Ishizaki.\nAnd you've come so far...)
And it's in! Just like Alberto does for Brazil,\nJapan's defense knows when to go on the offensive!
Even after being moved to defense,\nHokkaido's Wild Eagle is as strong as ever!
Matsuyama showed us his skill as a midfielder\nback in Furano MS, but he's really pulling out\nall the stops now!
I've faced Tsubasa, too, you know.\nI hope you weren't underestimating me.
The Ace Killer is no mere defender!\nHis stunningly sharp Razor cut through\nBrazil's defense like a hot knife through butter!
I used to be the ace of my team, y'know!\nI can do it all!
Even on defense, Jito made use of his natural\nkick strength to push in on the goal!
And that's when Sano, his teammate\nfrom Hirado MS, knocked it right in!
I'm kickin' down the door, boys!
I'm the one who scored the goal, Jito!
With all of Jito's muscles,\nit's a no-brainer his shot would pack a punch!
You watchin', world? Check out real strength!
Nice shot, Matsuyama!
Heh. I can't just be chasing after you forever.
I won't call myself anything as fancy as a\nlibero, but sitting back and defending\ndoesn't suit me.
Eh? So Matsuyama beat us to the punch?
Yeah. It's a little frustrating, but now,\nthe world knows how scary our defenders are.
Oh, right. Matsuyama was originally at midfield,\nand even though you two are on defense you've\nalways been the type push in.
We're not gonna lose to Alberto if our whole\nline-up is playing proper offense and defense!
Nice shot, Soda!
Heh, I figured it was right about time for the\nAce Killer to play his part.
A top-class Ace Killer has gotta be a top-class\nace, too.
Hmph. So Soda beat me to it.
Well, at least we've proved to the world that\nour defense can work the whole field.
Oh, right. Soda was a scorer back at\nAzumaichi MS, and you two were always the type\nto go for goals.
We're not gonna lose to Alberto\nif our whole line-up is offensive defenders!
Nice goal, you two!
We did it, Tsubasa! It worked!
With this combination of defender and forward,\nwe've stolen Alberto and Carlos's trick, huh?
Ha ha! Even if those two try to use a combo shot,\nit still won't be a match for ours!
After everything they said before the match,\nmaking them look a step behind feels kinda nice!
Really, was hopin' to get a goal on my own,\nbut eh, can't have everything.
That's not true, Jito.
Ha! I'm just havin' a laugh!
Nice shot, Jito!
Heh, I ain't losin' to that Alberto fella.
Goin' up against Brazil sets my blood boilin'.
Sheesh, so Jito got in there first.
Well, at least the strength\nof our defenders will be recognized now.
Oh, right. Jito used to specialize in overlaps,\nSoda has that sharp shot, and even Matsuyama used\nto be a midfielder focused on scoring.
We're not gonna lose to Alberto\nif our whole line-up is offensive defenders!
S-Sorry.\nA simple trick like that caught me off guard.
We can't change the past. We just need to watch\nout for Japan's offense from here on out.
Why bother? That was just pure desperation.
You're wrong, Carlos.
What?
That shot just now required the cooperation of a\ndefender and a forward. It was nothing like any\nof our shots.
Well...
Even you should understand the power of a team\nthat can all work together.
That shot just proved that they know what they're\ndoing. This is going to be a lot harder.
S-Sorry... I might've let my guard down\nwhen I saw it was just a defender.
Looks like even their defenders have the\nconfidence to take a shot. Just like me.
Yeah, they move around\na lot more than you'd expect.
Always looking for a chance to make a play or\nscore a goal... It might be better to think of\nthem all as liberos.
It doesn't matter what their doing.\nAll we need to do is score more goals than them.
No, that's not good enough.
What?
Their defender scored a goal,\nso I'm going to repay the gesture.
Do as you please.
Don't get cocky, Japan. I'll show you a real\nlibero!
Even as Japan's piling up the goals, Sorimachi's\nshowing us a different side of himself!
He's not just aiming for points,\nhe's also working hard to assist his teammates.
He's still aiming for goals like usual, but today\nhe's also helping out his teammates with assists!
And the results speak for themselves!\nAn amazing trio of assists!
By creating decisive opportunities on the front\nlines, he's polishing Japan's offense to a shine\nthis match!
Looks like Sorimachi's putting\nour lessons to good use.
He sure is. But not just anyone could do it.\nHe can thank his good instincts and hard work\nfor that.
You're different today, Sorimachi.
It's like... you're more determined.
Right. I'm a forward too,\nbut I finally found my groove.
So you're gonna help everyone out\nwhile still sinking shots?
Yeah.
I may not be able to control\na whole game like Tsubasa does.
But I thought I could bring us a little closer to\nvictory by doing good work up front and creating\nchances for the team to score.
So you're saying it doesn't matter\nif you score as long as the team wins?
It's not like I've given up on scoring. I just\nthought that when there are other reliable\nplayers up there, making plays is part of my job.
I get you.
And you showed me it was all worth it\nwhen you scored that goal.
C'mon, knock it off.
Alright, Sorimachi! I'm counting on you to send\nanother good pass my way! And then we'll win this!
I won't let you down!
All that's left is to give you... to give\nJapan's best striker that golden opportunity.
Heh, lookin' forward to it.
Alright, Sorimachi!\nI'm counting on you to send me that golden pass!
You bet!
Sorimachi's a little different today.
Yeah. If I had to say,\nhe's the type that likes to take the shot himself.
But today's he's going out of his way\nto make assists.
Hm...
This is just a guess, but that might be how he\nsees himself as a forward who represents Japan.
What do you mean?
This team has all sorts of exceptional players,\nspecializing in power, speed, technique,\nlongshots... the whole nine yards.
So surrounded by people like that,\nwhat can he do as a player? As a forward?
This must be his answer to that question.
He's always watching his surroundings to give his\nteammates a chance to score, even while scoring\nhimself.
If someone else has better odds of making the\nshot, he can also go for an assist.
He's always watching his surroundings to give his\nteammates a chance to score, even while aiming to\nscore himself.
If someone else has better odds of making\nthe shot, he'll prioritize the assist.
That's the sort of thinking\nI can sense behind his play.
Sorimachi...
(You impressively carried Toho Academy\nthrough Nationals when I wasn't there.)
(As your captain, I know I feel more\nresponsibility than anyone else.)
(And now you've even changed your playstyle.)
(You're definitely doing your duty as a forward.)
(I'm proud of you, Sorimachi.)
(Too bad I couldn't be out there\non the field with you, though.)
(I'm sure he perfected that style for me...)
And there's the whistle to end the first half!
Here at this final match, Japan\nis discovering the real value of\neverything they've learned so far!
And the first half ends with Japan leading\nBrazil, the home of soccer itself.
And there's the whistle to end the first half!
These two teams are really locking\nhorns in this incredible final match.
The first half ends in a tie score,\nand neither team is backing down in the least!
And there's the whistle to end the first half!
Japan isn't doing anything wrong,\nbut it looks like Brazil is just that good!
The first half ends with Brazil in the lead.
(I expected as much from Brazil,\nbut Japan has a good team, too.)
(And it's not just Tsubasa. All the players I saw\nin Japan three years ago have come so far.)
(Every player here has worked\njust as hard as Tsubasa.)
That was a great first half.\nIt really feels like a proper finals.
Although maybe it's tough to watch for someone\nlike you with ties to both teams.\nNo matter who wins, it's bittersweet.
Yeah, that's for sure.
(The finals...)
(That's right. I massaged Tsubasa's hurt leg\nat the All-Japan Youth Soccer Tournament.)
(If I could be by his side\nlike I was back then...)
...
Roberto.
That's the agreement.
If you have any advice for Tsubasa,\nI could pass it along.
...
...
There isn't any concrete advice I could offer now.
...
But if I could suggest something...
Tell him not to forget\nwhat's on page 52 of the notebook.
Strona 52... Got it.
...
You guys played a great first half!
Taking the lead against Brazil? That would've\nbeen unthinkable back when you first arrived in\nAmerica. It just shows how much you've grown.
There's nothing left for me to say. Keep playing\nyour best, and crush it in the second half!
I can do it!






Finally, just one more half to go.
And then it's goodbye, Tsubasa.
Misaki...
I know I said the same thing three years ago,\nbut let's end this with a win.
Okay!
Tsubasa even has the lead\nin his showdown with Carlos.
I wouldn't go that far...
But after being on the field together, I\nunderstood something. Carlos is an outstanding\nplayer. And that's why I need to outperform him.
I'll make Japan number one with\nthe Brazilian soccer Roberto taught me!
If Brazil's being more cautious of Tsubasa, that\njust makes it easier for other players to slip\npast them. It all works out in our favor.
We're counting on you, Tsubasa.
But Carlos is putting the pressure on Tsubasa.
I'd not expect anything less\nfrom Brazil's number 10.
But I won't lose in the second half. The South\nAmerican style of soccer I've cemented in my\nbones will take us all the way!
Yeah, that's the stuff!
But it won't be a perfect ending if we just win\nthe match. You need to outpace Carlos, too!
So Tsubasa's evenly matched with Carlos?
I don't like the way he plays,\nbut I can't deny that it's working for him.
But I'll definitely win this second half!\nUsing what Roberto taught me!
Sounds like a plan.\nWe'll all do our best to pin him down, too!
The first half was a total shut-out, huh?
Yeah. Brazil's marks were stickier\nthan I'd expected.
But we managed to keep Carlos pinned down, too.
That's true. I appreciate it, guys.
So I'm going to go out there\nand do what I do best!
Yeah, let's really bring it in the second half!
For sure!
They'll be more desperate now, though.\nEven if we have the lead, we can't be too careful.
Yeah, we need to keep an eye out\nfor any change in formation or marks.
This'll take everything we got.
We don't need to go that far.
I'm too tired to think about this...
Yeah, it'd be awful if we overlooked\nsomething and regretted it later.
Heh heh, devil's in the details\nif we wanna be the best in the world!
Nothing wrong with some confidence,\nbut that's a dangerous line of thought.
That's for sure. Let your guard down for a second\nand the next thing you know they've already taken\na point or two. That's soccer.
Might sound harsh, but that's the truth.
That not good. Here, drink something.
We'll need both your body and your head running\nat a hundred percent. Don't exhaust yourself!
(What a great team, the All Japan Youths.)
(Everyone, on the field and on the bench,\nis united in trying to win this match.)
(A team like this can't lose.\nIsn't that right?)
...
This is bad! We let them take the lead!
It's my fault, guys. We wouldn't be in this\nsituation if I'd stopped those shots.
Soccer's fun and all, but I gotta admit\nit's a lot less fun when you're losing...
What're you all moping around for?
Captain...
You can't expect everything\nto go your way the whole game.
We've still got plenty of time\nto turn things around.
What happens in a match is important, so what we\nreally need to do is win this thing and show\neveryone that Brazilian soccer is still the best.
We didn't come out ahead in the first half,\nso it's time to take it up a notch!
Don't forget that we bear\nthe honor of Brazilian soccer!
When this is all over,\nwe'll be the ones standing at the top!
Alright!




Sorry, Carlos.\nWe couldn't keep the lead you'd taken for us.
So what?
Huh?
All I need to do is score even more.\nKeep passing me the ball in the second half.
I'll win this for us.
(You're not alone, Carlos...)
(I'm there to support you!)
Carlos.
I understand. It's my fault that we're behind.
That's not what I was going to say.
Then, what?
Stay strong in the second half. With your skill,\nI know we can turn it around.\nWe're counting on you.
...
Sorry, Carlos.\nIf only I'd been doing more to support you...
You're wrong.
What do you mean?
I haven't been using you, Leo. In the next half\nI'll use you better. And then Brazil will win.
Carlos...
I think that first half went pretty well.
Even though you're up against Brazil, you boys\nhave got nothing to fear. You're playing on a\ndifferent level these days.
There's nothing left for me to say. Keep playing\nyour best, and crush it in the second half!
I can do it!






Finally, just one more half to go.
And then it's goodbye, Tsubasa.
What is it, Misaki?
I know I said the same thing three years ago,\nbut let's end this with a win.
That's the plan!
Gah, if only I could've kept more goals out!
So the Brazilians really are that much better\nthan the other teams we've faced.
Yeah, their rhythm and technique\nare in a class of their own.
But it doesn't matter who we're up against.\nThe job of a goalie is to stop any shot\nthat comes at me.
I won't let them get a single point next half!
Good luck, Wakabayashi!\nI'll be rooting for you from the bench!
Yeah, you protect that net for us!
I'm sorry, Wakabayashi.
What do you mean?
You've been working so hard to protect our goal,\nbut we've not been scoring.
Get it together, Tsubasa.\nI'll keep the goal safe while you get to work.
Wakabayashi...
Just you let me worry about our net. Brazil's not\ngetting in there. You focus on theirs.
That's how it worked back in elementary school,\nright? I defend, you attack, and then we win the\nchampionship! Let's not go changing the plan, now.
Wakabayashi...
Alright, you can count on me, man.\nLet's win this thing.
(It's completely my fault we're not in the lead.)
(If only I hadn't let those shots through!)
C'mon now, Wakashimazu, why so grim?
Ishizaki...
If you feel bad about letting those points\nthrough, just buckle down and stop the next ones.
What do you mean?
I mean, we're only at halftime!\nIt's way too soon to act like it's already over!
He's right! We'll get the lead back, but we're\ncounting on you to keep them from scoring.
Nitta...
Yeah, you're right.\nThere's no time for tears and pity parties.
They won't get a single goal past me\nfrom here on in! So go get our lead back!
You know we will.
That went well, Wakashimazu.
Yes.
But the going's only gonna get tougher.
But that's what makes it worth doing.
I mean, how many times do you get to go up\nagainst the best offense in the world?
Heh, well if you're that chipper,\nI guess I got all worried about nothing.
Tak! I've got this!
(Gah! If only I'd kept Carlos out of the goal!\nWe'd be in the lead now!)
(I knew I shouldn't have been in at keeper...\nWakabayashi or Wakashimazu would've been\nway better.)
(I made it through the first half somehow,\nbut things are heating up.)
(Am I going to make it through this?)
Don't fall apart on us now, Morisaki.
Wakabayashi...
Right now, you're the one entrusted with our\ngoal. You're representing Japan. Act like it.
...!
You've worked hard since we came to America.\nWe know.
If anyone can do it, you can! Have some\nconfidence! And play like you're representing all\nthree of us keepers out there.
(That's right... I'm representing all of Japan\nhere in the finals.)
(I'm carrying everyone's hopes and dreams!\nHow could I forget that?!)
Gotcha! I'll give this second half everything\nI've got! And we're definitely winning this!
That's what I'm talkin' about!
The fate of the world rests in your hands,\nMorisaki!
(What a great team, the All Japan Youths.)
(Everyone, on the field and on the bench,\nis united in trying to win this match.)
(A team like this can't lose.\nIsn't that right?)
Japan's better than I expected.
Yeah. It's a shame about the first half,\nbut it was all we could do to not lose.
It's my fault that we don't have the lead.\nBut you bet I have some shots brewing.
And I'll support you as best I can!\nWe can do this, Carlos!
Defense is important too, but in the end\nBrazilian soccer is all about offense. I won't\nlet any chances slip by either!
Sounds good to me!\nGuess I'll just keep them at zero then!
I wish I coulda kept them at zero. Sorry, guys.
That's not like you, Keizinho.
Alberto...
Yeah, if you start getting mopey,\nthen the rest of us will be off our game.
Your cheerfulness is the pillar of the team,\nKeizinho. I want you out there loving every\nminute and shot that comes your way!
Thanks... I needed that.
Alright! That's the last point\nthey're getting out of me!
I'm not into any of that old "our honor is on\nthe line!" stuff you guys do, so I think I'm just\ngonna have some fun! And win while I'm at it!
Keizinho?
Yeah?
It doesn't matter how many points you let\nthrough. I'll just score more than they do.
Dude, read the room!\nNot the right thing to say, bud!
Hahaha...




...
(I think that was just Carlos's way\nof trying to cheer him up...)
Okay guys, this match isn't just\nabout our own pride or our futures.
We're also carrying on the proud tradition of\nBrazilian soccer. Never forget that!
It all comes down to this half! The pride of\nBrazilian soccer is on the line,\nso we're taking home that trophy!
Zróbmy to!




Okay guys, we may be losing in score, but if you\nlook at the moment to moment play, we're just as\ngood as them. Be confident!
There's nothing left for me to say. Keep playing\nyour best, and crush it in the second half!
We can do it!






Finally, just one more half to go.
And then it's goodbye, Tsubasa.
What is it, Misaki?
I know I said the same thing three years ago,\nbut let's end this with a win.
That's the plan!
So that's Brazil, huh?\nThey're not like anyone we've faced before.
They're even different from the other South\nAmerican team, Argentina. They have a whole other\nrhythm and sense of tempo.
Every last player has so much confidence,\nand the sharpest play to back it up.
Then, we need to play without any hesitation.\nWhen we clash, we'll be that much faster.
But it's not like we can just magically\nget better... This is tough...
That's exactly why we need to remember\nhow we see our team.
Matsuyama?
We don't play as individuals. We play as a team.\nIsn't that how we've always won?\nAs long as we can do that, we'll get our chance!
Heh. Got me there. It's always better to break\nthe enemy's rhythm and drag 'em into our own.
We'll hafta adjust our method of attack again!
From what I could see, not even Carlos was a\nmatch for Tsubasa or <avatar_name> back there.
Yeah, I think we did pretty well against him.
But we're still losing...
There's still whole half left!
Because soccer isn't about individual skill...
Yeah, he's right!
What're you two so down about?
Carlos is the whole reason they're so confident!\nKeep outperforming him and the ship will sink.
And that's when us forwards go in for the kill.
So we're still relying on you two!
Hyuga...
Yeah, you're right. I'll take care of Carlos!
Looks like Tsubasa and <avatar_name> were having\nsome trouble with Carlos.\nGuess he really is that good.
"Good" is putting it mildly.
Sure, but that's what makes it fun.
You've got that right.\nBrazil's number 10 is no slouch.
But that's what makes going up against him so\nfun. That's how I feel, at least.
Tsubasa...
That's spot on.
Losing a match is frustrating, but part\nof me is grateful to be facing Carlos.
Tsubasa, <avatar_name>...
And maybe this is selfish, I really do want to\nbeat him. I have to play the way I play,\nso we can win.
...Heh. Of course.
So it's not just about winning or losing,\nit's also about beating that one guy, right?
Just like me back in the National finals.
Hyuga...
Okay you guys, go wild! Stop him with whatever it\ntakes! Do that, and you'll definitely shake the\nrest of the team.
You're the only ones who can knock Brazil\noff that pedestal they got up their butts!
I'll be there, too,\nso just you wait for those goals to rack up!
It's up to you two now!
Yeah. We're on it!
We're definitely taking Carlos down!
Too bad neither Tsubasa nor <avatar_name>\ngot to go head to head with Carlos.
It's even worse that the team's losing.
We'll get our chance next time. You'll see!
Yeah, I feel the same way.
But that's all the more reason\nto take him on next time. And win.
That's right.
If we want to win,\nwe'll need to knock Brazil off balance.
And the best way to do that is to stop Carlos.
It may be one on one against Carlos, but the\nwhole game depends on the outcome of that.
So we can't lose!
Whew, not bad you two.
Even though we're losing,\nyou never gave up for a second.
We're betting our counterattack on you guys,\nalright?
Tak! We're on it!
I guess the first half went okay-ish.
Their skill is too shocking.\nWe should be able to pull this off.
But given all the teams they beat on the way\nhere, we know they can mount a comeback like\nnobody's business.
Don't get anxious, but don't let your guard down!
Zróbmy to!




Carlos...
We've got Japan right where we want 'em, but\nnumbers 10 and 23 have been paying a lot of\nattention to you.
I'm sure it's difficult dealing with two\nopponents at once, but I think you can handle it.
Yes.
Leo?
Yeah?
Why do Tsubasa and <avatar_name> keep coming\nafter me, even though they can't win?\nTheir team's falling behind as a result.
Well...
You're a prime target, right?\nThey just want to beat you.
To beat... me?
Yeah. I mean, I'd probably\ndo the same in their cleats.
There's more to soccer than winning or losing\nmatches, y'know. There's the challenge of facing\ncertain opponents, as well.
How do I put this? There's a rush of\nadrenaline when you go head-to-head with someone\ngreat. I bet that's what they're after. It's fun.
Soccer... Fun?
...Worthless.
Hey Leo, was it something I said?
Nah, it's not you. Thanks, Keizinho.
Hmm?
(That was a bit awkward, but I think Carlos is\nchanging. He seemed like his old self\nfor a moment there.)
...
You look unhappy, Carlos.
Not really. The team's winning.\nI'm doing my duty.
You're frustrated about getting shut down\nby numbers 10 and 23, aren't you?
I promised them that I'd show them\ntrue Brazilian soccer.
But I haven't been able to. That's how I... feel.
But just you wait.\nThe second half is a new opportunity.
(Sounds like he was a little frustrated. That was\nthe expression of a guy who cares about more\nthan just winning the match.)
I've wronged Tsubasa and <avatar_name>.
What do you mean?
I promised them I'd show them true\nBrazilian soccer. But I wasn't able to do so.
Eh, you can still keep that promise in the second\nhalf. I'm sure they're still looking forward\nto the challenge.
(Sounds like he was having a little fun.\nThat was the face of a guy thinking about more\nthan just winning the match.)
(Maybe... Just maybe...)
Okay, it's showtime! Let's make it happen, guys!
We're taking this championship!
Zróbmy to!





(I haven't seen Tsubasa like this since\nthe National MS Soccer Tournament.)
(All he could think about was winning, and he\ngot so fired up he started acting a bit crazy.)
(I hope he doesn't end up like that again,\nthough. Even if we're up against Brazil\nthis time.)
(Roberto, I don't know if you're watching this\ngame, or if you're even in America right now.)
(But I'm going to win, Roberto! I'm winning\nthis championship, and joining you in Brazil!)
Tsubasa.
Oh, Mr. Katagiri.
Page 52 of the notebook.
Huh? What the...?
I'll see you later.
(Strona 52...)
!
(Wait, could it be... Roberto?!)
But... page 52?
What did Mr. Katagiri have to say?
I think I told you, but I have a notebook\non soccer strategy that Roberto gave me.
It's got all the stuff Roberto Hongo, who\nused to play for the Brazil national team,\ntaught me when I was a kid.
It's a notebook he wrote out for\nme full of stuff about soccer.
And on page 52 it says...
!
Oh! Now I see! I get it, Roberto!\nI know what you're trying to tell me!
What does it say?
Did you remember?
On page 52, it talks about...
Yeah, now I remember! Page 52 talks about...
How soccer is all about having fun!
Come on, tell me!
Tell me later.
Tak! You should know this,\nso I'll let you in on the secret.
Okay then, let's go!
Well, it's a bit longwinded, but here we go...
"Tsubasa, what makes soccer so fun for you?"
It's the most loved,\nmost popular sport in the world.


"I think it's because soccer is\nthe purest, freest sport there is."
"Once you're on the field, you're free to\nplay... free to think and act for yourself."
"There are boundless possibilities with ten\ncomrades focusing on one ball and one battle."
"Soccer is freedom. What will\nyou do in the middle of that field?"
"You can do anything you want. You can dribble,\npass, or shoot. You can just stand still."
"If you pass, you can pass forward, to the side,\nback... Anywhere is okay. The same with dribbling.\n"
"Soccer is freedom, Tsubasa.\nThat's what I love about the game."
"And if you're going to keep playing, I want you\nto learn to love it like I do. More than anyone."
That's what it says on page 52 of the notebook.
<avatar_name>,\nI think you love soccer just like I do.
So you'd do well to remember this, too.
Okay, time for the second\nhalf. Let's get out there!
Halftime is now over, and cheers\nonce more fill the crowded stadium!
Japan is currently in the lead,\nbut can they keep this pace up and\nwin their first world championship?
Or will Brazil and their tradition of soccer\nturn the tables and take home the win?
It's time for the kickoff\nof this fateful second half!
Halftime comes to an end,\nand cheers resound throughout the stadium!
Japan and Brazil are evenly matched, so we can\nexpect to see a fierce battle out there today!
When the final whistle blows, will Japan\nsucceed in taking the inaugural crown?
It's time for the kickoff\nof this fateful second half!
Halftime comes to an end,\nand cheers resound throughout the stadium!
In the first half Brazil showed us why they're\ncalled o pais do futebol, coming in with the lead.
But the Japanese side has been\nlearning from every match, and they've\nproven that they're in it until the last whistle!
When the final whistle blows, who will\nbe victorious and have the honor of\ntaking home this inaugural crown?
It's time for the kickoff\nof this fateful second half!
(Strona 52...)
(Mr. Katagiri has seen the notebook, but\nhe can't remember the whole thing, right?)
(And if he'd received that message before\nthe game, he would have told me earlier.)
(And that advice is just what\nI needed for this last half.)
(Roberto must be...)
(Roberto must be watching the game right now!)
(He's watching me play!)
Roberto! Heeey!
It looks like Tsubasa's going full throttle!
You will not stand in my way,\nTsubasa.
That's my line, Carlos!
I absolutely won't lose to\nyou!
Gah! Why can't I win?!
GOOOAAAL! Brazil evens out the score!
With a championship win for Japan within reach,\nwho cuts them off at the pass but Brazil's very\nown ace, the number 10 Carlos!
I've come too far to lose now.
Alright! Nice goal, Carlos!
I'm sorry we can't do much more for you as\na team. You've really been carrying us.
It doesn't matter. My role is to make sure\nwe win. I'm just fulfilling that role.
I'll hop on this Carlos train and help, too!\nI won't let Japan score another goal!
He's given us a fighting chance. It's time for\nus to secure our lead and wrap this game up!
Tak!




(Tsubasa... In the end, I will always win!)
(There's a reason why I have to win this.)
No! This is all my fault.\nIf I'd been able to stop him before.
Tsubasa, you don't bear the burden of victory\nalone. If they scored a goal, that's on us, too.
He's right, you know. You're not trying to play\nthis game by yourself, are you?
Misaki, Hyuga...
Don't get so hung up. That's not like you,\nTsubasa. We're tied up, that's all.
Yeah. If we give up a point,\nwe just have to take another back!
Definitely!
I don't know why I let that get to me.
It's time to worry less about the one we gave\nup and do what we do best by scoring our own!
Tsubasa. If they scored a goal, that's on us,\ntoo. It's no one person's fault.
Misaki...
Who cares if it's a tie game. We've been tied\nbefore. We just need one goal to get back ahead.
I won't waste one more second. My best foot\nis going forward and through the ball.
Misaki...
I'm so glad you're here, Misaki.
You're absolutely right! No point in beating\nmyself up over a goal. That's not like me at all!
Come on, Misaki! We'll score the winning goal\nagainst Brazil and win this!
That's the spirit, Tsubasa!
(Carlos's face doesn't betray an iota of joy\nin his play. He's so incredibly serious.)
(But Roberto is in the stands. I need the win\nto show him just how good I've become!)
(The score is tied up. Now's not the time\nto lose hope. We can do this... We can win!)
Carlos! Time to decide who's\nthe world's best!
Fine by me, Tsubasa!
We will never give up!
I can't... Roberto, I'm sorry...
G-GOOOAAAL! The teams are in a dead heat!\nThat point ties the score!
And the one who brought it home was none other\nthan Japan's captain and ace, Tsubasa Ozora!
He turned an impossible situation into a success.\nI'm speechless! It's anyone's game now!
We won't give up. This days is ours, and we will\nbe known as the best team on any continent!
Nice one, Tsubasa!
You always come through in a do-or-die situation.\nYou never fail to impress.
No time to celebrate now. We've only tied it up.
Until the tide truly turns in our favor,\nthis goal is just getting back to square one.
I agree. Give me a shot\nand I'll score the winning goal!
I'll make use of every last breath I have time to\ntake on this field. Let's take the lead\nand win this together!
It's time to leave it all on the pitch,\nand take Brazil down!
Nice one, Tsubasa!
I knew you'd come through for us!
Thanks, Misaki!
We can't celebrate just yet, though!\nLet's save it for after we take the lead and win!
You got it!\nLet's ride this wave and score another!
That's the plan!
Yes! Now we're tied up.
But we still need to secure the win.\nTime for another goal, boys!
I'll score that goal for us!
You can count on my assist!
Just one? We can score more than that!
That's the spirit!\nI'll be looking for a shot, too!
Awesome! I'm sure you will!
If you see a shot, though, be sure to take it!
You're absolutely right, <avatar_name>.
A one point lead doesn't put us in the clear.\nLet's aim to score more than just the one.
Ack. What happened there!
Carlos! You're not the only one playing the game.\nWe're in it together. We win as a team!
You should listen to him.\nGiving up that goal is on all of us.
I don't need your pity. Tsubasa got me good.\nI'll be sure to return the favor.
That's fine.\nWe'll try to create an opportunity for you.
If you want to win, be sure to get the ball to me.
I'm not sure how much you can count on me,\nbut I'll be doing my best to support your play.
Sure. Thanks.
That's it, folks! There's the final whistle!
They did it! Japan has won the championship!
Japan is the champion of the first\nJunior Youth World Challenge!
They beat Brazil, the kingdom of soccer, and now\nthey have a crown!
Not that Brazil didn't put up a good fight!\nWe saw some wonderful play out there!
A big round of applause for both teams for\ngiving us a fitting end to this tournament!
And there's the whistle!
Even on this grand stage to determine the best\nin the world, the winner remains uncertain!
It's all down to overtime now!
And there's the final whistle!
Brazil wins! The nation of soccer is our champion\nfor the first Junior Youth World Challenge!
Japan came close, so close,\nbut faltered at the final hurdle.
You all played well under pressure\nthroughout the entire game.
You must all be tired, both physically and\nmentally. Rest up while you can. There are\ntougher matches ahead of us.
Even tougher ones?!
That's what I live for, baby!
<avatar_name>! This is no time to be whining.
Yeah. More than a competition of skills\nor stamina, those that lose heart are\nthe first to go.
I'm just glad we were able to square off with\nBrazil, again. It was a great opportunity.\nLet's enjoy the sport and the competition!
That's what I like to hear.
Any soccer player would be elated to compete on\nsuch a grand stage with so many talented players.\nI know I am!
I remember the elementary school tournament\nfinals going into overtime, too.
Yeah. The MS tournament this year did, too.
For real? You guys really like cutting it close,\ndon't you?
But we won both of those matches. Who knows,\nmaybe overtime is our lucky rabbit's foot.
We'd better not lose any steam just because it's\novertime! Brazil's on our chopping block if we\nwant to be number one in the world!
Tak!





(Everyone follows Tsubasa so naturally.\nHe really is a great captain.)
(I'll leave the overtime to him, then...)
Okay, <avatar_name>! You're the vice captain.\nGet your team fired up!
Japan will be the new kingdom of soccer!
We're here to be recognized as the world's best!
Fight on! No regrets! No holding back!
The new kingdom of soccer, eh?\nThose're some big words comin' from ya!
You know what, though? A dream ain't worth\nchasing if you can't dream big!
That's right! We didn't come\nall this way to be number two!
We've had our sights set for the top,\nand nothing's changed about that!
You bet! And let's win big!
Tak! There'll be nothing to regret,\nso long as we win!
Great pep talk, <avatar_name>.\nYour words really got everyone revved up.
Now, let's get our heads back in the game\nand dominate this OT period!
(It seems pretty apparent that Tsubasa has taken\n<avatar_name> under his wing.)
(And <avatar_name> has done\na great job of keeping up with him.)
(I knew it. All of you are going to revolutionize\nthe game for Japan and usher us into a new era.)
(So show us how you're going\nto do that in overtime.)
Everybody, be sure to relax before we go out for\novertime. We've still got a tough game\non our hands.
Relax? I'm not even tired! I can't remember the\nlast time I've had so much fun in a match.
Keizinho, you never cease to amaze me\nin odd and wonderful ways.
Carlos, you've been running up and down the pitch\nfor two halves now. How're your legs treating ya?
This is why I train. I'm perfectly fine.
That's good to hear.
And you, Leo?
Me?
I'll be fine.\nYou've got my support in overtime, as well.
Good.
Where are you going?
I'm headed back the pitch.\nI can't focus with all this racket.
Get me the ball in overtime, too.\nI'll make sure that Brazil wins.
Man, that guy's on a different level.
Leo, I think we need Carlos to score,\nso please give him the support he needs.
Got it.
The players only had a moment's rest, and now\nthey're taking their positions back on the field.
This has been a long finals match, and it seems\nlady victory is playing hard to get today.
Both noble teams have struggled valiantly,\nand this overtime will be the final test of\ntheir already tired bodies.
But both teams look toward victory\nwith eyes unclouded by distractions!
And so, who will find glory at the end of this\ngrueling match? Will it all end in a shootout?
And the first overtime half begins!
Let's give them a fight to the\nend, team!
Everything for the win.
The whistle ends the first half of overtime!
Japan has created an opportunity for themselves!\nWill they keep hold of it to the end?
Or will Brazil turn the tables and win?
The first half ends with Japan in the lead!
The whistle ends the first half of overtime!
These teams are in a deadlock! The\ngame remains tied even in overtime!
This has been a match truly fitting this rivalry,\nbut who will break through for the win?
And the teams are tied!
The whistle ends the first half of overtime!
Is Japan's fatigue after this long\ncampaign beginning to show?
Or could it simply be that Brazil's\nwaiting to unleash their true strength?
The first half of overtime ends\nwith Brazil in the lead!
We're so close to being number one in the world.
With the lead,\nall we have to do now is maintain it.
That's a dangerous line of thinking.
What?
Hyuga's right. This isn't your average team. It's\nBrazil. They're called the kingdom of soccer for\na reason, and they're not going to lie down.
If we only stick to defense, they'll entangle us\nin their pace and rhythm in no time.
If Brazil wants to go on the offensive, then our\nbest defense is a good offense! Tit for tat.
Okay, I got you!
Right, let's start this half on the offensive!
Tak!





The best offense is a good defense!
The best defense is a good offense!
So you're saying this is going\nto be a true test for our defenders!
Tak! Shore up our walls and keep 'em out!
I reckon maybe then we could use the same strat\nas when I was at Hirado, yeah?
Okay folks, listen up.
Brazil's hungry for the win, and they'll come\nclaws at the ready. But we can't fall into the\ntrap of playing passively.
The best defense is a good offense, right?
Well then, how about the strategy we used at\nAzumaichi? It's perfect for times like this!
Here's what we do.
I see... That's a nice, logical plan.
I agree. It's a solid plan.\nLet's roll with it in the second half!
Okay guys, we're just a inches from the trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Roger that, Coach!






I'm sorry. I'm the reason they're in the lead.
Don't be ridiculous.\nA lost point isn't all on the goalkeeper.
But there isn't much time left. At this rate...
...Brazil cannot lose.
What?
I will definitely lead Brazil to victory\nand be known as the best player in the world.
That's the whole reason I'm on this team!
Carlos!
(Soccer is all I have. If I fail to become the\nbest in the world, why in the world\ndo I even exist?)
(Isn't that right, God? Is that not the reason\nyou took Grandma and Grandpa?)
Carlos...
...
You said you'd definitely lead us all the way,\nright?
Yeah. What about it?
Then let's attack using our power combo.
...
Japan is a strong team.\nYou can't win all alone, Carlos.
You're awfully talkative today.
But it's true. Just look at where we stand.\nCan you honestly say I'm wrong?
...
Leo's right.
Alberto...
You're not the only one that wants to be number\none in the world. The captain, myself, Leo,\nand the entire team wants it just as badly, too!
Now's not the time to be a show off and pretend\nit's just you out there. We should be willing\nto do anything for the win.
...
Leo, we're going full force\nwhen the whistle blows.
...!
Umm, okay!
I won't let them score another point,\nso you guys need to score one for us!
Listen up, everyone! We're representing o pais do\nfutebol. Let's show them what we're made of!
There's still time.\nWe can still catch up and win this thing!
Tak!




We've come so far,\nand yet the score still stands even.
I've been runnin' on adrenaline so long\nmy bones are startin' to hurt.
I'm tired, too.\nBut it's no doubt the same story for Brazil.
I'm in it to win it! I don't care how far I have\nto push myself, so long as my spirit is unbroken,\nI've got life enough in me to keep running.
You were exactly the same\nduring the National finals.
Heh, I'm gonna show 'em how stubborn\nI can be on the field, too!
There isn't much time left. If we want to win,\nit's time to set that field on fire.
Tak!
Exactly! That's what our team is all about!




We need to score a goal to win.
And how do you propose we do that?
A coordinated attack!
A guaranteed goal.
Exactly! That's what our team is all about!
Okay. Let's surge up the field\nand try to coordinate an attack.
If that's the idea, I've got the perfect plan.
It's that secret move we worked\nout at Hanawa! Lemme explain...
I see... That's a nice, logical plan.
I agree. It's a solid plan.\nLet's roll with it in the second half!
Okay guys, we're just a inches from the trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Roger!






Tak! We need a powerful, game-winning shot!
As a goalkeeper, I can tell you that's what I\nfear the most. That last strike usually has a lot\nmore power behind it than at any other time.
It seems you've learned by watching me play,\n<avatar_name>. Great suggestion.
Hmph...
You know what it means to be an ace striker,\n<avatar_name>.
Strikers carry the weight of the team on their\nshoulders and have the eye of the tiger.
Eye of the tiger, eh?\nI think I need to learn more about that.
You're a striker, too, Tsubasa.\nYou don't need me telling you this, but...
I guess I'll indulge you.
Listen up.\nThe most important thing to take to heart is...
That's definitely something you'd say.
Then, I'm going to be stalking my prey\nand running it down in the second half!
Okay guys, we're just a inches from the trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Alright!






This is the first time\nI've faced such a strong-willed team.
We may be one of the top teams, but these nerves\nare enough to tire even the most seasoned\nveterans.
Aren't they in the same boat?\nI'm sure they're feeling it, too!
That's right.
Carlos...
We've got to think about what the worst thing\nwe might have to face in this situation is.
If we can figure out that worst-case scenario,\nwe can come up with a counter-offensive.
The worst thing would be...
Japan will probably try to take advantage of our\nfatigue. If they break through our defenses...
In other words, we need to be sure\nto play at the top of our game.
Yeah, that sums it up.
Simple enough, I guess.
Do not let your guard down or spirit falter!\nSo long as we hold tight to those,\nvictory will not elude us!
Let's do this, guys!
Tak!




(I can't believe Carlos decided\nto say something to encourage the team.)
(Could it be...)
This isn't looking good. The clock's ticking down.
Argh. We didn't come this far just to lose.
Quit whining!
Urabe?
Take a good look at Tsubasa.
We still have time! The match isn't over\nuntil the whistle blows! Don't give up yet!
Tsubasa...
That's his true strength.
He's been the captain of teams that have come\nback from the most dire of situations.
Pep up, guys. Takeshi, Nitta! Heads up!
Ishizaki...
The pressure, this whole do-or-die situation...\nWe don't get to experience this everyday.\nEnjoy it... embrace it!
Well, that's one way to look at it.
This is where we are, so let's make the best out\nof it and get things back in our favor!
That's the spirit!
Okay, guys, let's do it! It's ours for the taking!
Tak!





If only I could be a game-changer...
It's do-or-die! We're in this together!
I totally feel you, <avatar_name>.
But a run-of-the-mill play won't cut it.
I'm sure <avatar_name> will understand,\nhaving played together for so long, but...
My experience might be useful here.
...
Tsubasa, you got a second?
What is it, Misugi?
I've been subbing in to change the flow of games\nsince elementary. I know a thing or two about how\nhard it is to come back from a tight spot.
Perhaps, I could give you\nan idea or two to consider.
Having to change the tide midgame may be more\nemotionally challenging than being on the\nstarting roster.
Misugi, if you wouldn't mind,\nplease tell me more about your mindset.
Sure thing. So...
Amazing. To think that way going into\neach and every one of your matches...
I think you've given me a great asset\nfor the second half!
And I'll definitely turn things around!
Okay guys, we're just a inches from the trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Alright!






Time to go for broke. I can roll with that.
The idea of a big comeback might be\na bit romantic, but hey, I'm romantic.
Nothing's impossible so long as\nwe band together and play cohesively!
<avatar_name>, Ultimate Formation\nwas our specialty at Furano.
Ultimate Formation! In that case...
Could I get everyone's attention!
Ultimate Formation was our specialty at Furano.\nLet me explain how it works.
Listen carefully...
I see. That just might work.
I agree. It's a solid plan.\nLet's roll with it in the second half!
Okay guys, we're just a inches from the trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Alright!

Tsubasa.




Man, we're about to be champions! I'm so excited!
Keizinho, get your head out of the clouds.\nIt's still too early to celebrate.
I know that!
I sure hope so...
Victory is almost ours, Carlos.
Yeah, it is.
What'll you do once we win?
We haven't won yet. And I'm not interested\nin talking about hypotheticals.
Yeah, I get ya. Let's cement our win first.
Yes, let's.
Let's go, everyone! It's time for Brazil\nto be crowned best in the world!
Tak!




(The winner will be determined\nin the second half.)
(I'm not giving up. I'll never give up.)
(Brazil's main player is Carlos. If I can beat\nhim one-on-one, Brazil should falter and our\nchance to score will show itself!)
(So I've got to face Carlos and win!)
I know you plan on taking on Carlos.
What is it, Misaki?
I know you can beat him. I believe in you.
...Yes.
Once you get past Carlos,\nthe two of us will go on a hard offensive.
We'll take the lead and take the win.
We'll tie it up, and then take the lead\nto win this championship.
We'll tie it up, and then take the lead\nto win this championship.
Misaki...
Okay! There's no one we can't beat when we're\ntogether. Let's get that trophy, Misaki!
This seemingly endless tournament has all\ncome down to this final half. If the score\nremains tied, it all ends in a penalty shootout!
Both of these teams have fought tooth and nail,\nand either one could walk away a winner today.
How will this Junior Youth World Challenge\nfinally end?!
It's time for the kickoff to this\nfateful second half of overtime!
Today is the day I will beat\nBrazil.
I'm going to be number one in\nthe world!
No! That's impossible!
Ack! It was no use. I'm sorry,\nMisaki.
Keep going, Tsubasa!
Keep going, Tsubasa!
We did it, Tsubasa!
Got it! Get ready because\nhere I come, Brazil!
GOOOAAAL!
In the final moments of this intense battle,\nthe ones in the limelight are the Golden Duo,\nTsubasa and Misaki!
The two-man squad scored a crucial goal!
Tsubasa!
Misaki!
We did it, Misaki!
But we can't let it get to our heads.
The two of us together are unstoppable!
But we still don't have the lead.
Absolutely. We've got to keep our wits about us\nuntil the end. Let's go finish this!
Tsubasa... I'm not going to let it end like this!
I WILL tie it up and take the lead!
(Tsubasa and Misaki. So this is the\ninsurmountable strength of Japan's Golden Duo.)
(If only Carlos and I were more in sync\nlike they are. We could...)
We're just getting started.
Let's use this momentum\nand score another goal to win it!
Tsubasa...\nI am going to dribble past you once again.
(So this is the insurmountable strength\nof Japan's Golden Duo.)
(If only I had the ability to draw out more of\nCarlos's potential, we'd be a duo that could go\ntoe-to-toe with the likes of Tsubasa and Misaki!)
Tsubasa. You seem happy about it.
Yeah. Let's use this momentum to tie it up and\ntake the lead!
Tsubasa... I can't believe\nyou've still got fight left in you.
Fine. I'll just score another goal,\nand purge any last hope of winning you had left.
(Tsubasa. Misaki.\nSeeing you two play together is poetic.)
(If only Carlos and I could work together\nas well as you two...)
He did it!\nCarlos scored a crucial goal in the final moments!
That's Brazil's absolute ace for you, folks!
Carlos!
That's our ace for ya!
How about we go get another one!
I don't know what to say...
Awesome job, Carlos!
Let's not let our guards down, though.\nThe game doesn't end 'til the fat whistle sings.
But we still need another goal\nto become the champions.
We just need to keep doing what we're doing\nand score us another one!
Nothing's really changed yet.\nWe have to stay on the offensive.
This game is all ours now!
C'mon, let's get back at it!\nThere isn't much time left!
Let's band together as a team\nand give it our best with what time we have.
Tak!



We're counting on you, Carlos!
I guarantee we'll get you the ball!
Come, Carlos, we've a game to play.
(The team is coming together...)
(I used to...)
(No. I need to forget that.\nThat's not my style of soccer!)
(But...)
(But how do I want to play soccer?\nWhat is soccer to me...?)
And there's the final whistle!
Yes! They did it! Japan wrested control in the\nfinal half and has won the championship!
Japan is the champion of the first\nJunior Youth World Challenge!
They beat Brazil, the kingdom of soccer,\nand will be crowned champions!
Not that Brazil didn't put up a good fight!\nWe saw some wonderful play out there!
Both teams deserve our appreciation for\ngiving us a fitting end to this tournament!
And the whistle blows to end the overtime!
Skill against skill, will against will...\novertime ends with no clear winner!
Their fates will be decided in a penalty shootout!
But before that, let's congratulate both of these\nincredible teams on a stellar performance!
And there's the final whistle!
And after this grueling final match,\nthe goddess of victory smiles on Brazil!
Brazil, also known as the kingdom of soccer, is\nnow our champions!
Hard as Japan fought, they\ncould not squeeze out a win.
It's over! Wait, no it's not...
We've still got the penalty kickoff to go.
So it's come down to penalty kicks...
Tsubasa. You seem happy about it.
I mean, I'm definitely frustrated I didn't win.
But I've admired Brazil for so long, and when I\nthink about getting to do a penalty shootout\nagainst them, I just...
You're rather enjoying this, while anyone else\nwould likely buckle under the pressure.\nBut that's why there's only one Tsubasa.
The pressure I feel now... I don't if I'll ever\nget to experience it again, so I might as well\n"enjoy" it as much as is possible.
We've already come so far! What's the point in\nletting the pressure crush me now? I'm gonna take\na pointer from Tsubasa's book and try to enjoy it!
I'm so nervous my belly's aching...
If I score a penalty kick, I'd be branded a hero!
Confidence is key to winning this!
Anyone would be nervous in this situation.\nIt's a matter of how you turn those jitters\nto your advantage.
It's almost like a game against yourself!\nI won't let wuss me win the day.
Okay! I won't let you outdo me, <avatar_name>!
I'll be putting in 110%!
Heh... We won't lose to you underclassmen either!
So put some spirited stank on your shots!
At this point, there's not much left to say.
Believe in yourselves.\nGo out there and win this championship!
Alright!






Even I will get to be a hero in goal,\nso long as I stop their shots!
You can do it, Wakabayashi!
When it comes to a penalty shootout,\nI've got all the skill and determination\nI need to stop anything.
You can do it, Wakashimazu!
Sh-Shootouts are the best way to show off as a\nkeeper! I'll do my best to go home a hero, too!
You seem more alert than usual, Morisaki.
At this point, there's not much left to say.
Believe in yourselves.\nGo out there and win this championship!
Alright!






Put some heart into it and let's see this through!
The rest is up to all of you!
Let's win this shootout and be champions!
When it comes down to it,\nwe're second to none in spirit.
Our powers combined will\nbe enough to defeat Brazil!
Hey there! You're not out of this yet,\n<avatar_name>! You've still got a role to play!
Ahahaha...

We've been through a lot together.\nI just know we can do this. So let's do it!




To be able to jest at a time like this.\nYou're really something else, <avatar_name>.
We'd probably all do well to learn from you.\nWe've got to be at our best!
Any feelings of nervousness can be turned into\nstrength if you know how! Use that to bring home\nthat trophy!
We've been through a lot together.\nI just know we can do this. So let's do it!
At this point, there's not much left to say.
Believe in yourselves.\nGo out there and win this championship!
Tak!

Tsubasa.




I can't believe myself.\nI can usually close things out...
We all played our best game. We shouldn't be\nmelancholy about the outcome.
...
You all played magnificently.
We couldn't finish things during actual play\ntime, but I want you all to swallow your pride\nfor now.
We've got a penalty shootout to win.\nDo that, and the championship title is ours.
Our role... our duty as Brazilians is to win no\nmatter what, and claim our spot atop the pinnacle\nof the soccer world for all to see.
You don't have to remind me.
You can count on me! The closer the score is,\nthe more revved up I get.
I won't let you steal all the thunder, Keizinho.\nI'll be giving it my best, too.
Listen up, everybody. We're here to win,\nand don't you forget it!
Tak!




And there it is, the absolute final whistle!
Yes! They did it! Japan dominated the\nshootout and has won the championship!
Japan is the champion of the first\nJunior Youth World Challenge!
They beat Brazil, the kingdom of soccer,\nand will be crowned champions!
Not that Brazil didn't put up a good fight!\nWe saw some wonderful play out there!
A big round of applause for both teams for\ngiving us a fitting end to this tournament!
After a fierce final match, it's all finally over!
Brazil dominated the shootout!
These two fierce competitors were even\nto the end, but Brazil eked out a win!
Japan was just inches from victory, but\nsadly just couldn't take that final step!
Champions! All Japan Junior Youth\nis the world champion!
W-We won!
Champions!
We WON!
Tsubasa...
We're number one!
We're the best in the world!
The entire team is flocking to Tsubasa.
Woohoo! We did it!
We won!
We won the whole thing!
All Japan is number one!
Good job, <avatar_name>!
I just know we won today because you were here,\n<avatar_name>.
It wasn't just me. It was a team effort!
I worked hard for all of us!
You don't have to be humble about it!\nNow's the time to be proud and soak in the glory!
Oh, cut that out! You were amazing!
See, even Ishizaki says so!\nGo on, <avatar_name>,\nyou've earned a little glory.
This victory... It's...
The team has hoisted Tsubasa\nup on their shoulders!
Woohoo! We did it!
We won!
We won the whole thing!
All Japan is number one!
Tsubasa! You really are incredible!\nYou crazy fool, you!
Oh, Ishizaki...
This is Tsubasa's victory!
We won because you all played so hard!
No, everyone was a part of this!
Yeah, that's right!
The whole team earned this win.
Victory!
Yeaaah!





















(World champs... The dream is no longer a dream.)
(I'm so glad... I'm so glad\nI never gave up on soccer!)
Congratulations, Japan.
All I've left to say is, I'm happy for you.
The championship... Amazing.
I knew you could do it, Tsubasa!
Japan has a team worthy of being champions.
It seems Wakabayashi has redeemed us\nby playing for Japan and winning it.
Sure.
The stadium is filled with cheering\nand applause for our winners!
...
We... lost?
We lost. Of all the teams... we lost.
Ahahaha. We missed our chance to be number one in\nthe world. That's enough to even get me\na bit gloomy.
Get yourselves together. It's time to go.
What?
We lost. We should at least show some\nsportsmanship by thanking and congratulating\nthe Japanese team.
Don't forget, that's also a part\nof being a soccer player...
I guess so. They did play immensely well.\nI should go congratulate them.
I've got something to say\nto them... Mostly, to him.
Carlos...
And there are the tears. The incredible rush of\nemotion is overwhelming the All Japan Youth team!
I'm sure there were many trials and tribulations\nthey faced individually and collectively.
But they were able to overcome those obstacles\nand are now the reigning champions of the world!
Japan has won the Junior Youth World Challenge!
Congratulations, All Japan Junior Youth!
Congratulations, Japan. You guys are number one.
Alberto...
I really hate that we lost, but I love that we\nduked it out in a fair fight. You guys are just\nas good as I imagined you'd be!
...
Carlos...
Tsubasa. <avatar_name>. This was your day.
But I'll see you in the Brazilian league,\nTsubasa. And I'll be ready.
Just keep that in mind.
Carlos seldom gives such high praise.\nProbably why he's not very good at it.
You plan to come to Brazil next year, right?\nLet's have a rematch then.
Sure thing. I'm already looking forward to it.
(Carlos isn't one to show his feelings,\nbut I think this match has changed him somehow.)
(I probably have you to thank for that, Tsubasa.)
(If you follow through and come to Brazil,\nperhaps Carlos may even...)
(<avatar_name>'s offense and defense are both\namazing. They rival my own level of skill.)
(I have to become the best in the world,\nbut it doesn't look like the path to get there\nwill be an easy one.)
Your shots are really something else! I mean,\nthey've got to be if even I can't stop them.
Your shots were amazing. I never imagined running\ninto a player whose shots would give me\nso much trouble.
They were as powerful as Schneider's Fire Shots.
I feel fortunate to have been able\nto battle such skilled shots.
Next time, they're not getting by me, and you'll\nreally appreciate what an awesome goalkeeper\nI am. I hope you look forward to it!
Your offensive and defensive play are impressive.
As I thought, you have the potential to\nunderstand soccer from many different angles.
I hope you continue to grow as both a rival\nand a comrade in the soccer world.
You are a well-rounded soccer player with both\ntalented offensive and defensive play.
You seem to be following a path similar to mine.\nI hope we both continue to grow and get better.
We may have lost today... But the next time\nwe face off, Brazil will come out on top.
Yeah.
Next time...
Next time it's the World Cup!
Sure thing. Looking forward to that day.
Time to go, everyone!
We'll win the next tournament.\nThis is only just the beginning of our journey!
Tak!




And the Brazilian Junior Youth team leaves\nthe field just ahead of their Japanese rivals.
The stadium echoes with thunderous applause\nfor these brave runners-up, Team Brazil.
Yes, I understand.\nI'll be sure to come out ahead next time.
Who was that, Carlos?
...
The owner, huh?
...
Carlos!
(Just leave me alone, Leo.)
(I decided on that day a long time ago that I'd\nbecome the world's best soccer player...\nand I'd devote my life to doing so.)
(I'm sure that's what God, who took\ngrandpa and grandma up to Heaven, wants, too.)
(That's why I'll be giving myself over fully\nto pursuing that objective.)
(I don't need the extra baggage of human emotion.)
(That's how I'll be like a machine\nin the soccer world...)
(I will fully become the Soccer Cyborg.)
Junior Youth World Challenge Quarterfinals,\nSecond Match, France vs. Uruguay
Hey, <avatar_name>,\nwho do you think'll win?
France
Uruguay
Jeez, you're no fun. That's\nwhat everyone else thinks, too.
Well yeah, that's because it's the only right\nanswer. France has been dominating this\ntournament.
Sorry <avatar_name>,\nbut I think France is winning this one.
France has gotten at least 4 points every\ngame, and given up a big fat goose egg.
The closest thing they've shown to a\nvulnerability is their defense. Pierre sometimes\nis forced to drop back to bail them out.
But with Jean there to keep their\ndefense secure, they're without worry.
Seems so.
(Thanks to Jean, Pierre can stop worrying\nabout defending and focus purely on offense.)
(This is more than a matter of pure strength.)
We're at the fifteen minute mark, with France in\na dominant position thanks to Napoleon's goal.
In a hurry to catch up, Uruguay's focused on\ngetting the ball to their ace, Victorino!
And as expected, a pass to Victorino!
You can see why he's being called the Black\nPanther of South America! He's surged into\nFrance's side with nary a moment wasted!
Ha! A one point lead is nothing!
What's this? A French player\nis closing in on Victorino!
It's Jean!
What?! There's no way his\nlegs are a match for mine!
Hmph. I'm not even trying!
Wh-Where'd he go?!
Over here, goofball!
H-How?!
Jean has taken the ball\nout from under Victorino!
He sidestepped into Victorino's\nblind spot in a blur!
Incredible...
And once again, the ball is passed to Victorino!
He's slipping past France's defenders\none after another, while maintaining\ncomplete control of the ball!
But Jean is rapidly gaining on him!
Whose technique will win out?!
There's no two ways about it.\nYou're no match for me.
And Jean steals the ball\nfrom Victorino once more!
As I suspected, South American technique\nisn't all it's cracked up to be.
N-No way!
Pierre!
And Jean passes it to Pierre effortlessly!
Here we go, Napoleon! Eiffel Tower Rush!
Right with you!
Now we see Pierre and Napoleon's renowned\nlightning-quick pass work! They've punched through\nUruguay's defenses without slowing down!
I'll let you have this one, Pierre! Make it count!
Of course!
I-It's in! France puts another\none in the net just like that!\nCaptain Pierre appears unstoppable!
Their teamwork seems awful\nreminiscent of Tsubasa and Misaki.
Yeah, Napoleon's shots might be more eye-\ncatching, but his passes are amazing, too.
But still, I can't believe Pierre\nwas sitting on a shot like that.
It looked like it sank hard right in front\nof the goalie. What WAS that shot?!
It probably works similar\nto how my Drive Shot does.
But while the Drive Shot is known for\nusing its spin to climb upwards...
That shot looks like it uses\nits spin to push forward.
I see. So it's another application\nof the Drive Shot then.
And that's the game!
France handily beats Uruguay,\nadvancing them into the semifinals!
Jean was the clear MVP of this match.
Even Victorino was helpless against his\nflawless defending! And Victorino is\none of the best forwards in the tournament!
His talents have kept France from giving up\nsingle goal all tournament! Truly, he has earned\nthe title, the Shield of France!
So next up is France, huh?
We already knew this, but they're good.
It's the same as always. We just gotta win.
(Pierre... I'm not going to let you beat me.)
(But if I want to outpace him, my\ndribbling needs to be taken up a notch.)
(Misaki... I'll finally get to\nface off against you.)
Easy-peasy. I almost fell\nasleep out there. Right, Pierre?
But Captain, was it really a good idea to reveal\nour Sliding Shot and Eiffel Tower Rush?
It won't matter.
Until now it might've been best to\nkeep them under wraps, but now\nwe've got another trump card.
Yeah, I get you.
Wow, only two more games until we're officially\nthe best in the world! Let's keep it up!
Come in.
Oh, if it isn't Tsubasa and Misaki.\nWhat brings you here so late?
Roberto came to the stadium.
...!
You meet a lot of people, Mr. Katagiri,\nso we thought you might know something.
How did you find out, Tsubasa?
Actually...
I see. So that's how it went.
So Roberto is an acquaintance of\nArgentina's Coach Barbas. I never\nthought it'd slip out like that.
Th-Then what Diaz said was true?
Yes, it's true.
Then... Then why didn't you tell me?
Calm down, Tsubasa.
It's not like I didn't want to. But\nRoberto asked me not to tell you.
But why?!
That's...
Why would Roberto do something like that...?
It was a painful decision for him too.\nI know it's not easy to accept,\nbut... Try to understand.
...
So, where is he now?
He should still be somewhere on the island.
...!
But the team he's coaching for was invited\nto a friendly meet in another US state.\nHe said he'd be departing late tonight.
Tonight?
Indeed.
Then we can still make it, Tsubasa!
I...
...
Tsubasa?
...I can't.
Why not? Haven't you been psyched\nto see him again basically since he left?
I really would like to, but...
But I'm the captain of the team. I can't go\noff on my own. I have responsibilities.
Tsubasa...
Plus, what really matters is that now I\nknow he's still active in the world of soccer.
So, as long as I keep playing,\nI know I'll meet him again, someday.
Tsubasa... I guess you're right.
(You really are a captain, through and through.)
(Just be patient. I'll make certain...)
Junior Youth World Challenge Quarterfinals,\nThird Match, Brazil vs. Italy
They're sending out Hernandez?\nDidn't he break his hand?
They can tape him up like a boxer, and with\npainkillers... He can still punch the ball.
But just think of the damage he'll take\nwith every shot he blocks.
He'd go that far to keep playing?
I feel sorry for their second string keeper.
He's got guts.
It's because he's the captain.
I agree with <avatar_name>.\nThat's just rude to the guy.
I'd imagine it sucks to be thought of like that.
Yeah, I've definitely been there.
Being a goalie's all about never accepting\ndefeat. Every point is personal. It'd be\nweirder if he weren't so stubborn.
You're right. He's crucial to the team.
Especially, considering you never really\nhear anything about their players except for\nRusciano and Hernandez.
And Brazil starts off on the attack!\nCarlos is already in shooting range!
Ugh!
An excellent save from Hernandez! Despite his\nbroken arm, he blocked Carlos's fierce shot\nwith his right hand!
Still, not a bad shot, Carlos.
No, I got what I wanted.
Huh?
I'll mangle that paw of his into pulp and force\nhim to switch out. That's the surest way we\ncan win.
...!
And Italy is mounting a counter-offensive!\nRusciano is charging into Brazilian territory!
And here it comes! Rusciano's finisher!
Inconceivable! Keizinho firmly catches the shot!\nWhat an anticlimactic end to such a swift counter!
Impossible...! He stopped it so easily!
Heh, I've always wanted to go\nup against a fantasista like you!
I hope to be just such a\nplaymaker at keeper, myself!
A fantasista goalie?!
Exactly! Something wrong with that?
This is no time for chitchat, Alberto!
Let's go, Leo!
On it!
Alberto the libero, or sweeper for our American\naudience, received the ball and is advancing to\nthe front lines to join Leo!
Eat this!
Alberto lets loose a powerful long bomb!
Not today!
And Hernandez blocks yet another tremendous shot!
But the rebound is headed right for Carlos!
Oh no!
It's over.
And the ball has found the goal! Carlos's shot\nhas defeated Hernandez's Golden Right Hand!
And what's this? Hernandez's right hand looks\nhurt! Was he injured by the blocked shot?!
Gah, if only my hand weren't hurt!
Looks like Hernandez will need to spend\nsome time on the sidelines, after all.
Despite his astonishing skill, this\nis just proof we all have our limits.
Okay guys, Italy's just become majorly vulnerable.
But that's no reason to get careless!\nGive this everything you've got!
Tak!




...
And that's the match!
Brazil takes down Italy with points to spare,\nand will be advancing to the top four!
Italy may be known for its robust defense, but\nCarlos and Alberto were just too much for the\nsecond string keeper.
Even Rusciano, the one man offense, seemed to lose\nhis luster after Hernandez headed off the field,\nand later swapped out during the second half.
However, Brazil finally seems to have rallied\ntogether under the auspices of their captain,\nAlberto!
I can't wait to see what\nthey'll do in the semifinals!
So Brazil won, huh? Well, no surprise\nafter Hernandez swapped out.
And it looks like Rusciano lost\nhis drive after that, too. Figures.
Still, I can't help but admire\nHernandez's hardiness out there.
He had the guts to keep defending the goal\neven when his hand was in pieces...
So how'd Brazil look to you, Tsubasa?
Carlos was amazing, same as ever. The\nteam's coming together, too, little by little.
I was wondering if maybe they're taking it slow,\nso they can be at their best for the finals.
We don't have that luxury, but I've heard that\nthe top countries will ease into it like that.
So you're saying we won't see\nthem play for real until the finals?
(And to see that up close, we\nneed to make it to the finals, too.)
Alright! Zróbmy to!
D-Do what? What're you talking about?
Oops, sorry...
Junior Youth World Challenge Quarterfinals,\nFourth Match, Germany vs. America
So Germany's poised to win here, right?
I hear America's good, but\nI'm sure Germany's better.
Huh, look at America's bench. Doesn't look\nlike they have a number 10...
You're right. There was no number 10 in the\nmatch against us, either, right?
They have a number 10 registered, but perhaps he\nisn't feeling well or something. He's never shown\nup. Not even on the sidelines.
Oh, huh. I kinda feel sorry for him. If this were\nbeing held in Japan, I know I'd be looking forward\nto it.
Yeah. There's nothing worse than\nwanting to play but not being able to.
Now that you mention it, Heine's\npretty lucky to have made it here.
After seeing the injury he got in Hamburg,\nI didn't think he'd be back on the field\nanytime soon.
I heard from a German acquaintance that they\nbrought him to America for some special medical\ntreatment.
They do say American medicine is pretty advanced.
And if Heine can hold down the\nmidfield, Germany can't lose.
Just as in his other matches, Heine is holding\ndown midfield for Germany, and creating pressure\nwith his specialized dribble!
I hope you're paying attention, ladies\nand gentleman, because it's time for\nmy one man show!
Looks like his dribble is serving him well,\nas he slips past the burly Americans!
Ha ha! Useless! You'll never stop me like that!
He's mocking us! Get him, guys!
Hey, Blake! Don't just give out your own orders!
Letting it get to you just makes ya look dumb.
Łoł! Heine passes straight through\nthe swarm of Americans surrounding him!
Schneider is clear as he receives the ball!
Schneider enters the penalty area and\nprepares to go one-on-one with Azwan!
You gotta be kidding me!
Azwan's is in a tight spot and dives!
I'll take that!
And Germany takes the first point! No surprise\nthat it's their ace, Schneider, with the goal!
Germany's greatest weapon this tournament\nhas been their hotline to their playmaker, Heine!
Schneider took a point from\nAzwan like it was nothing.
...
No goalie would be able to react in time\nwith Schneider in his face like that.
And now America begins their counterattack!
Just pass it to me already, guys!\nI'll end it with a Blake Shot!
Blake sprints in toward Germany's goal!\nThere's a pass heading right for him!
H-How dare you!
But it doesn't connect! The\nvolente, Schester, intercepts it!
Did you really think a simple\nplay like that'd work on us?
Kaltz!
And with lightning reflexes,\nSchester passes to Kaltz!
You got it! Coming through, dudes!
Stop him! No... Mark Heine!\nHe's the key to their plays!
At Blake's direction, the\nAmericans crowd Heine!
Here we go, Heine!
Shocking! Did Kaltz just miss his pass?\nIt's gone flying off in a strange direction!
Nice pass, idiot... Wait, no way!
It was no mistake! Margus is charging\ntoward the ball's destination!
Heh, kinda hurts that you\njust forgot about me, honestly.
Ha! Go ahead and head it! I'll just stop it!
Here we go!
Schneider!
Seriously?!
Margus isn't making a shot!\nHe headed the ball sideways!
Right towards Schneider, who's\nslipped away from his mark!
Thanks, Margus!
And it's in! Schneider's already\nscored two goals today!
Nice shot!
Nice pass!
I could only slip away because they got\ncareless after they all headed for Heine.
But that's Kaltz the Trickster for you. Did\nyou even shout my name to mislead them?
Sure did. Use whatever you can, I always say.
Seriously, that scumminess of\nyours is definitely top class.
...
C-C'mon, I was kidding!
...In the end, they only got my Dresden because\nthey couldn't read the direction of Kaltz's pass.
And that's the game!
Germany easily crushes America\nand makes the semifinals!
Heine controls the midfield while Schneider and\nMargus attack, leaving Schester and Kaltz to\nstop a counterattack.
This match went exactly according\nto Germany's ideal game plan!
And their next opponent is already decided! It's\nBrazil, who they've just won their match!
That'll be a game to watch out for, as\nthe two titans of the tournament collide!
Hey, Azwan! How many goals do you\nhave to let through before you're happy?
You're blaming me?! Your orders suck! Anyone\ncould've seen that intercept coming!
Why aren't you forwards doing your\njobs? And "Blake Shot"? Seriously?
Back off man, no one disses the Blake Shot!
...
...
This is stupid.
Yeah... No use getting worked\nup over a match like this.
The Americans seem pretty upset.
I'll bet they are, after getting their butts\nhanded to them like that. It's gonna be\nhard to live that one down.
While there were differences in skill, too, what\ncould they expect when they're so uncoordinated?
It really matters who's calling the shots.
I guess, but wasn't there just\ntoo big a gap in technical skill?
The Americans win out in size, but a fat lot of\ngood that is if they don't know how to use it.
Still, bigger is better.
Soccer is all about technique!
But what's most important is mental fortitude.
Hmm, I'm not gonna deny that, but how's\na little guy like me supposed to take that?
Size ain't everything, Sano.
You an' the Tachibana brothers are lighter and\nnimbler than me. And that's cuz yer... lithe.
Jito...
Course, if you were teeny AND had muscle...
Say, how 'bout you join me\nin weight training today!
P-Please, anything but that! If I tried\nyour training regimen, I'd be wrecked!
Hmm, yeah I guess that'd be a lil much. But\ntrue power comes from the muscles, man.
(Sano seems to have it\nrough... in a lot of ways.)
Yeah, exactly! I'm a small guy, but I\ngot this far by being light and skilled!
Not that I don't look up to guys\nlike Hyuga, who can put so much\npower into their kicks, too.
That's because Hyuga's got just the right balance.
(A build like Jito's would be a bit much\nfor me. Seems like it'd be annoying.\nLike, when buying clothes...)
What's wrong, Sano? Somethin' on my face?
N-No, it's nothing!
You get it, <avatar_name>.\nIn the end, it always comes down to willpower.\nStrength and skill don't mean a thing without it.
I learned THAT from fighting Tsubasa.
That's for sure. Even when he was all busted\nup, his strength and skill didn't suffer a bit.
Actually, forget struggling, it was\nalmost like he improved because of it.
So next up is Brazil vs. Germany, huh?
...
...
Guess you two have mixed feelings about it, huh?
No...
Not really...
Alright, split into offensive and\ndefensive groups and get into\nposition! Training formations!
Yes, Coach!






C'mon, here we go!
Can you stop our combo?
Soda, go!
Pattern B, right? Gotcha! Leave it to me!
Soda...
As long as I'm here, that\nlimits where they can shoot.
Ishizaki, we'll stop them over here!
On it!
Wow, before I even said anything...
Gah, we can't get through!
It's no use. Regroup!
Now it's our turn, <avatar_name>.\nSo, how do you think we should attack?
Break their formation from Ishizaki's side.
Go for a post-play from the second line.
Feint a pass and break through with a dribble.
I see. With that line-up, it does look like\nwe can find an opening on Ishizaki's side.
Alright, leave the sideline to me!
Okay, I'll go in front. I can handle Jito.
Yeah. We'll run around behind them. Looks like a\nshort pass from there would wreck their formation.
Pretty gutsy of you...
But a surprise attack from\nthe front might just work...
Okay, I'll be the decoy, acting\nlike I'm going to receive a pass.
Alright, here we go!
You bet!



Hey, do you have time after this, Takeshi?
I wanna practice making\ndirect plays at full speed.
Perfect timing, I was just thinking I needed\nto improve the accuracy of my kicks from far out.
Cool! Let's do it over there then.
The notes say I should move like this, but\nwouldn't it be better to train like this for when\nthey're coming from the right?
Oh, I get it. With your jumps, Wakashimazu,\nmaybe that way's more effective.
Okay, I'll get the guys together to discuss it.
Everyone's thinking more critically about their\nplay on their own now. And it's all thanks to your\nnotes, Wakabayashi.
I only came up with the idea because\n<avatar_name> and I talked about it.
I was just thinking of getting everyone to train\nharder by stirring up their desire to win.
But after what <avatar_name>\nsaid to me, I realized something.
I realized it'd be better if I could\nsomehow share my three years\nof experience and knowledge.
So if you want to thank someone, thank him.
Yes, praise me more!
I was just thinking of the team.
Actually, I wasn't thinking that far ahead...
Don't get cocky.
Yeah, but if people thought like you\nthis team would be unbeatable.
R-Really?!
Well, at least it worked out well.
But this really is a great team.\nEveryone's taking it so seriously.
Yeah, everyone loves soccer, after all.
Let's win this thing, you two.
Yeah, for sure!
Thanks for inviting us to practice\nwith you today. It was great!
Thanks for inviting us today. It was great!
Nah, we should be thanking YOU.
Usually we only see each other in serious\nmatches, so it was pretty fun to just practice\nwith each other casually.
Plus, we got to see all kinds of new\ntraining methods and techniques.
Man, soccer sure is awesome.\nBringing the world together, huh?
Well, let's play again as reps some time!
Man, ain't soccer the best? As long as you got\na ball, anyone in the world can play together.
Anyway, see ya! Let's play\nagain as reps some time!
Keep at it, guys!
Representing Japan, huh...\nWill I get chosen again?
Let's play even if we're not\nrepresenting our countries!
That kinda sounds like\nyou're looking down on them...
Ha ha, don't worry! You'll be fine!
I guess anything can happen with the local\nteams, but could you not say stuff like that?
Well, things sure got heated\nup first thing in the morning.
Hey, look over there!
Whoa, so they were practicing\nwith other countries, too?
Wait, isn't that Ishizaki and Urabe?
Oh, you're right!
Since when did they--
Hey guys!
Tsu-Tsubasa!
Morning! So you've been\ndoing morning practice, too?
You, too, Tsubasa?
Yeah, I got invited by the other countries,\nand the coach said okay, so why not?
And not just me. I hear Morisaki and\nSoda got invited by a team, too.
I'm sure Morisaki'll be fine, but\nI'm a little worried about Soda...
Yeah, I hope he doesn't get in any trouble.
Ha! I can see that.
At first this was just some practice in the\nmornings, but now it's like this whole exchange\nprogram...
It's all thanks to your hard work, Takeshi.
Well, I for one am ready for breakfast.
I didn't think much of it when we started,\nbut it's become really important to me.
Yeah, same here. Why don't\nwe head back to the dorm?
Still though, it just feels nice to expand\nour circle of soccer buddies.
And it never would've happened if you hadn't made\nthat suggestion, <avatar_name>.
I'm so glad we came to America...
Okay, we'll split up into two\ngroups and have a mini-match.
<avatar_name>, you're with the regulars.
Racja! I won't let you down, Sir!
Now that it's mine, I'm never giving it up!
Good answer! Keep it up!
That's the spirit! Now keep it up!
Well, you seem back in the swing of things.
I mean, I'm happy for you, of course,\nbut did something happen?
Actually...
The coach...
Oh, really?
He did? Let's talk to him about it.
Coach!
What is it?
I heard from <avatar_name> that you\ngave him some guidance regarding his attitude\nin training. We all really appreciate that.
I wouldn't say I did all THAT much.
He just realized what was happening\nand picked himself up on his own.
I've been in the soccer business a long time, you\nknow, and I've seen a lot of talented players.
But unfortunately, more than a few of them\nnever make anything of themselves.
And of those, most of them take their success for\ngranted and cut corners on their training, letting\ntheir talent go to waste.
<avatar_name>, your talent is an amazing thing,\nand that's precisely why I want you\nto never let up on your training.
Keep up this new attitude and become\na real hero to the sport, alright?
You too, Matsuyama.
Racja! I won't let you down, Sir!
You've been really into this lately,\n<avatar_name>.\nI've been wondering about this, but...
You changed so suddenly. Did something happen?
Actually...
The coach...
Oh, really?
I see. Come with me for a sec.
The coach did? What's up with that?
Coach!
What is it?
I heard from <avatar_name> that you\ngave him some guidance about his attitude.\nThank you!
Nah, it wasn't anything as fancy as "guidance."
He just realized what was happening\nand picked himself up on his own.
I've been in the soccer business a long time, you\nknow, and I've seen a lot of talented players.
But unfortunately, more than a few of them\nnever make anything of themselves.

<avatar_name>, your talent is an amazing thing,\nand that's precisely why I want you\nto never let up on your training.
Keep up this new attitude and become\na real hero to the sport, alright?
You too, Misugi.
Racja! Thank you!
Well, aren't you taking this seriously for once,\n<avatar_name>?
I figured if you didn't change I'd\ngive you a good hard smack\ntoday, but... Did something happen?
Actually...
The coach...
...That so?
He did? What's up with that?
Coach!
What is it?
I heard about it from <avatar_name>.\nThis should've been my job, but he ended up\nbothering you about it. I'm so sorry.
No no, I don't think of it as a bother at all.
Plus, it's not like <avatar_name>\npicked himself up because of my guidance.
He just needed a word to put two and two together.
I've been in the soccer business a long time, you\nknow, and I've seen a lot of talented players.

<avatar_name>, your talent is an amazing thing,\nand that's precisely why I want you\nto never let up on your training.
Keep up this new attitude and become\na real hero to the sport, alright?
You too, Hyuga.
Yup, that's the plan!
(You've been doing great, Tsubasa. I know you'll\nbe an amazing player when you get older.)
(You don't need someone like me anymore...)
Hello?
Hey, Roberto.
It's Coach Barbas.
Our last match went just like\nyou warned us it would.
That Tsubasa Ozora of yours\nwent toe-to-toe with Diaz.
...
Actually, about Tsubasa...
I was thinking of scouting him\nfor the Argentina pro league.
Oh?
If he can keep up with Juan Diaz, the treasure of\nArgentina, then he'll do great even in Argentina.
Diaz is set to start playing with one\nof the top pro teams this season.
And if there were a talent like\nTsubasa to compete with, I just\nknow he could grow even more.
If Tsubasa just wants to be the best player in\nJapan, then waiting three years wouldn't hurt.
But if he's serious about playing around the\nworld, then three years is way too late. He\nneeds to spread his wings now.
...
Be Tsubasa's coach when he returns\nto Brazil. I'm asking you, please.
Please, help him to fulfill his dream once again.
I'm gonna go to Brazil and be\nthe world's best soccer player!
Roberto?
Oh, sorry about that...
Oh right, you said Tsubasa was your student,\nright? Why didn't you think of taking him to\nBrazil with you?
...Well, I had my reasons.
I see... Well, if you don't\nwant to say, I won't press.
Anyway, I was going to wait for the end of the\nfinals to offer Tsubasa a formal contract.
(Tsubasa... Signing on with Argentina?!)
By the way, are you still in America?
Y-Yeah. I'm in another state though. The boys'\nsoccer team I'm coaching is having a friendly\nmatch.
I see. Then let's grab lunch, or something,\nwhen you can, for old time's sake.
Okay, talk to you later.
(Tsubasa...)
(Tsubasa, I...)
Junior Youth World Challenge Semifinals,\nSecond Match, Brazil vs. Germany
Listen up, everyone. Until now I've respected\neveryone's desires and let you guys play\nhowever you wanted.
But today's different. No matter how good we are,\nthis isn't an opponent we can beat with everyone\noff doing their own thing.
The time for each of us to show off to the world\nis over! Against Germany, we need to play as a\nteam! Got it?
Got it!




...
Brazil is going to be unlike any\nother team you've faced so far.
But at our level, there isn't a team in the\nworld that we can't beat. Stay strong!
Yes, Coach!





And fortunately we've got a new weapon\njoining us today... You can come in now!
(That's...?!)
Brazil and Germany, huh?
We'll be up against one of them next, but either\nway, this match is too exciting not to get a bit\ninvested.
So who do you think'll win then?
Germany, of course. Brazil's good, but the\nGerman players are on a whole other level.
But from what I can see, while the Germans are\namazing from the midfield on up, they're a bit\nlacking on the defense side.
On the other hand, Brazil's got both a solid\ndefense and amazing offense because of\nCarlos. I think they've got a good chance here.
Stop fanboying, you two.
Both teams are coming in now!
Wh-Who's that German goalie?
He's huge... He must be two meters tall!
N-No way... It can't be...
That's the Illusionary Goalie, Deuter Muller!
He was Germany's goalie?!
He never said he was Germany's goalie!
I knew he was special, but this?!
Wha...? You met Muller?!
When? How?! Tell me!
Wha...? You've talked to Muller?!
When? How?! Tell me!
The way you put it...\nIt sounds like you know him.
When did you meet him? How?!
I see... so it was here in America.
Not even Genzo or I ever saw him in Germany.\nSo to think you've already met him...\nFate works in mysterious ways.
H-Hey, Wakabayashi, could you tell us what\nthis whole Illusionary Goalie thing's all about?
Yeah.
In Germany, the man's a legend.
Illusionary?
You know him?
So he's not just big then?
Yeah, they tell stories about him\nin German soccer circles.
Not personally, but no soccer player\nin Germany hasn't heard the rumors.
I haven't seen him play myself either,\nbut according to the rumors he's amazing.
One time, the champion German team went to a\ntraining camp in a small mountain village. They\nhad an exhibition match against the local team.
At first, they weren't taking it seriously, but\nby the end they were taking REAL shots against\nthe local team and couldn't score a single goal.
And that was because Muller was on the local\nteam. He blocked every last shot from the pros.
He kept out the pros?! All of them?!
After seeing him in action, the pro team's coach\nmade him an offer on the spot, but he didn't want\nto leave his home, so he turned it down.
The fifteen year old prodigy\nwho lives deep in the mountains.\nThe Illusionary Goalie, Deuter Muller.
B-But that's just talk, right?\nIs any of that even true?
Well, we'll find out this match.
...
The match begins with a kick off from Germany!
Across the field, Brazil is doing something new\nand tightening up their defenses. Are they that\nconcerned about Germany's offense?
Gah, it won't be easy to\nget into their box like this.
I'll just have to apply a little extra force!
Schneider's still quite a ways\nout, but he's readying a shot!
H-He caught it! Schneider's\nunstoppable Fire Shot was stopped!
Ugh, not bad...!
So this is the famous Fire Shot, huh? It really\nis amazing! And is something burning...?
That Brazilian goalie just caught the Fire Shot!
Guess I should've expected that\nfrom a representative of Brazil...
Heh heh, when the opponents turn\nturtle, it's time for my skills to shine!
Heine's footwork is in fine form today!\nHe's toying with Brazil's defense!
Enjoy it while you can!
Aaah!
Alberto explodes in with a tackle!\nHe's brought down the exceptional Heine!
Carlos!
And he passes to Carlos!
You're going nowhere!
Oh no!
Carlos slips past Kaltz and goes for the shot!
Impossible!
The shot's been caught! Deuter Muller\neasily catches Carlos's sharp shot!
Carlos's shot was stopped?!
So that's Muller.
In the ensuing play, the game was deadlocked.
Heine tried to be the center of the German\noffense, but Alberto stuck to him like glue. He\nwas unable to get in a good pass to Schneider.
On the other side, thanks to Schester and Kaltz\npinning down everything past the midfield, Brazil\nwas also unable to get the ball to Carlos.
As a result, both Schneider and Carlos had to go\nfor long-distance shots, which were easily stopped\nby the iron wall of Keizinho and Muller.
With neither side able to seize any points,\nthe game approached its end with\na score of zero to zero.
And that's when one side found an opportunity...
Oh, no! Kaltz's tackle has tripped up Carlos!
Since they were right outside the penalty\narea, Brazil gets a free kick! This is the\nchance they've been waiting for!
Sorry, this is my fault...
No, it'd have been even worse if we'd let him\nthrough. This is just what I'd expect from the\nTrickster.
Schneider...
Just as expected,\nCarlos will be taking the free kick.
Will Germany form a wall in front of the goal?
Don't need no wall. Makes it harder to see.
A-Are you serious?!
Alright, we're counting on you, Muller.
Heh.
What's this?! Germany is abandoning setting\nup a wall?! More and more, this is looking like\nthe chance Brazil's been dreaming of!
Wha--?!
Fine, you'll regret it, though!
Let's go, Leo!
Y-Yeah!
Leo gets that ball moving downfield,\nbut here comes Carlos charging right after it!
Freed up, he's loaded that shot with jet fuel!
Take this!
H-How...?!
H-H-He stopped it! Muller firmly caught\nCarlos's full-strength shot!
Now, Muller! Send it my way!
Hmph. Fine!
Muller quickly tosses it to Schester!
Here goes nothing!
And here comes Germany's response!\nSchester advances, pursued by Brazil!
(I never liked you, Heine.)
(If you said I was just jealous after losing to\nyou in the German tournament and losing my\nposition to you here... you might be right.)
(But after seeing how serious you've been about\nyour rehabilitation, and how passionate you are\nabout soccer, I realized how petty I was.)
(Heine, you're a player for the ages!)
Great job, Schester! He weaved his way\nthrough the narrow gap in Brazil's defense\nand passed the ball to Heine!
Go, Heine!
You're the only one who can\ncut your way through them!
Schester...
Here I come, Brazil!
Heine dribbles ahead!
Go, you guys!
On it!




At Alberto's command, the\nBrazilians rush him en masse!
Keep 'em coming! You can't touch me!
Th-This is incredible! Unbelievable! Heine's\ndancing through a storm of Brazilian tackles!
Now you've done it!
And Alberto dashes in! He make a fierce tackle,\naiming to catch Heine with his feet planted!
Heine's caught in an awkward\nposition! He can't dodge it!
(Bring it on, Alberto! I'm not losing to you!)
(This is for Schester, who trusted me!)
(And for Schneider, who taught me\nthe magnitude of taking on the world!)
(And for everyone else who helped me\nrealize just how small I really am!)
There's no way I'm losing here!
Wh-What--?!
Ugh!
H-Heine forces his way through! The physically\nsuperior Alberto was sent flying!
...Oh!
Over here, Heine!
Margus?!
(I get it!)
It's up to you now!
Heine sends the ball flying toward\nthe goal! Margus is running up to it!
Time for another miraculous header!
Gah! No, it's mine!
Margus and Leo are fighting over the ball!
Bring it on! Your shot just means\nanother chance to counter!
Here we go, Brazil!
What?! Margus let the ball past!
What?!
Schneider has slipped away from his\nmark and is charging toward the ball!
It's all on you now, Captain!
Even better! It's on, Schneider!
Keizinho is leaping out towards Schneider!
Kaltz... Muller... Schester... Heine... and\nMargus. This ball means everything to all of us.
I won't miss!
Schneider foot is wreathed in flames!
It's... It's in!
Schneider put everything into that Fire Shot! The\nworld's ace has buried the ball in Brazil's goal!
...!
Incredible...
Wakabayashi, wasn't that...?
So you finally broke through that wall, Schneider.
And that's the game!
What a dramatic ending to a match that will go\ndown in history! Thanks to Schneider's last\nsecond goal, Germany is going to the finals!
You can see the enthusiasm in\ntheir players over on the pitch!
Nice shot. Bet only I coulda stopped it.
Your shots are even better than mine,\nSchneider! ...Just a little better, though.
That ball carried a little bit of each of\nyou with it. It was the sum our hard work,\nand I had a duty to see it delivered.
Nice one, Schneider!
Yeah.
You too, Margus.\nThat through pass put me to shame.
I just happened to see Schneider slip his\nmark, so I figured he'd need a distraction.
It's pretty amazing that you saw\nwhat I was going for, Heine.
It's like I always say, it's my job to keep\nmy eye on the ball... and everything else!
Heine.
Schester...
Just one more game until we're officially\nthe best in the world. Keep it up.
Yeah, you too!
We fought our hardest, but we still couldn't\nget it done. I feel like my heart is aching.
Let's take that frustration home with us and\nuse it to improve ourselves. And after the next\ntournament, we'll have moved on.
That last shot was amazing... I think all\nmy fingers are broken... Ow ow ow...
But wouldn't it be awesome if I caught that?\nI'll show him next time... Whatever it takes!
(The only reason the club sent me as a\nrepresentative was to win the\nchampionship for Brazil.)
(But even so, we lost. I lost.)
(How? Why? What am I missing?)
(...)
(I suppose I must pledge more of myself to God...\nand the game. To win, I need to offer everything.)
(I am Carlos Bara. I live only to be\nthe world's best soccer player.)
(This sport is everything I am!)
Carlos...
Brazil lost.
Well, what can you do? That's soccer.
We've gotten better, but looks like Germany\nhasn't been slacking off either. I wonder if\nwe've narrowed the gap since the scrimmage...
If anything, we're better than them now.
It's no fun without strong opponents.
We've made it this far! Have a little faith!
Hmm... I dunno if you're basing that on\nanything legit, but I admire the confidence.
Good enough for me! Don't they always say the\none who is sure of victory has the advantage?
I guess they do, but hearing it from you\njust makes me even more nervous...
Hey!
Ain't that for sure! That's what we came\nall the way out here fer, ain't it?
Heh heh, now you're getting me excited too!
Yeah, that's right. It's a bit late\nto be worrying about that. All\nwe can do now is give it our all.
Alright guys, let's head back and keep practicing!
When we beat Germany, we'll become\nthe best in the world! We need to be as\nready as possible!
Alright!






(At last, the finals. When we first came to\nAmerica, I never imagined we'd make it this far.)
(Just one last step, and they'll be world\nchampions. I'd love for them to win, but...)
Just in time, Katagiri. Could you gather together\nthe players for me? I'd like to have a meeting.
But Mikami...
None of the players are in their rooms!
Eh?
America, Italy, Netherlands, Senegal, Argentina,\nFrance, Brazil, and now Germany.
America, Italy, Netherlands, Senegal, Argentina,\nFrance, Germany, and now Brazil.
Italy, Netherlands, Senegal, Argentina, France,\nGermany, Brazil, and now America.
Tsubasa was right, the world's a big place. It's\nlike amazing players just keep sprouting out of\nthe ground.
We really were big fish in a small pond.
Yeah, I only realized that after we came to\nAmerica and started facing the other teams.
And in our very first match against America,\nour initial confidence was just shattered.
Even Tsubasa was getting shut down.\nThe rest of us didn't stand a chance.
And then came Germany. That was humiliating.
Karl Heinz Schneider. He made me realize that the\nworld is full of players better than I could even\nimagine.
But because of those losses,\nwe started practicing even harder.
Misugi...
We've come this far, we can't turn back now.
It's too late to stop. We're taking on the world!
Hyuga...
He's right. Back in Japan we all\ncompeted around Tsubasa, but from\nnow on we're on the global stage!
Yeah, this is just the beginning of our soccer\ncareers! The world is now our arena!
No matter how much it hurts, none of us\nwill ever stop running toward our goal.
Yup. And that goal is...
Japan winning the World Cup!
To be atop the world!
To win the title of best in the world!
Tak! Dream big or go home!
You make it sound like mountain climbing...\nbut I guess it is kinda like that!
Best in the world, huh...? Got a nice ring to it.
You guys...
(I can feel it... All of our dreams becoming one.)
(I've been dreaming of it since I was\na kid. Winning the World Cup for Japan...\nThat's my biggest goal.)
(But fulfilling that dream alongside\nthe others... Having powerful allies\nI can depend on...)
(I've... I've never been so happy in my life!)
Alright, first step: win this thing!
If we want Japan to be the best in the world,\nfirst we've gotta win the\nJunior Youth World Challenge!
Tsubasa!
You got that right!
We'll beat all those crazy players,\nand stand on top of the world!
Tsubasa...
Tomorrow we're up against Germany.\nThe winner will be whoever can lock\ndown the midfield.
The German midfielders are Heine, Schester,\nand Kaltz. This'll be the toughest match yet,\nbut I know our team can meet the challenge.
But not only do we have to hold the midfield,\nTsubasa has to go head-to-head with Schneider!
Tomorrow we're up against Brazil.\nThe key to their strategy will be Carlos.
But he won't be flying solo. With setups that\nutilize his teammates, he'll be nothing like the\nplayer we've seen so far.
Brazil's number 10... Carlos Bara.
You're the only one who can take him on, Tsubasa!
Tomorrow we're up against America. The one\nwe should be worried about is definitely Ryan.
With his insight and talent for leading,\nthe American players will be playing\nbetter than their best.
But if you look at that the other way\naround, they rely heavily on him. If we\ncan pin him down, we might just win this.
The Dictator of the Field... Ryan. You're the\nonly one who can take him on, Tsubasa!
So this is where you all were?
And were you...?
Right, we were doing last-minute\ntraining for tomorrow!
We're going to win this, Coach!
We'll win, and become the champions.
And we'll carry that championship\ncup back to Japan.
That's the plan, Coach.
You boys...
(Your desire to improve is truly inspiring. I'm\nthe adult, but I feel like I've learned more from\nyou than you have from me.)
(But I can't let all your effort go to\nwaste. I need to do what I can, too!)
Right, which is why we'll be having\na meeting back at the dorm.
Yessir!
Hey Coach! Can we have a late\nnight snack after the meeting?
You're still hungry?!
Well, yeah, the rice balls they\nmake here are the best!
Actually, the tofu miso soup\nthey have is pretty good, too.
Urabe you definitely were raised\nin the household of a tofu seller.
Aw, shut up!
Ha ha ha!




Junior Youth World Challenge\nDay of the Finals
That morning...
Alright, that's enough for a morning warm-up.\nHow're you all feeling?
I'm at the top of my game!
I'm just a little tired.
Good to hear!\nTry to take that into the match, too.
Hey, you're even younger than me! Don't be lazy!
Ishizaki, how old are we now...?
There's something I need to tell you guys.
What's the matter, Tsubasa?
Actually, for today's match...
I want <avatar_name> to act as vice captain.
You're making him the vice captain?
You want <avatar_name> to be the vice captain?
Him? The vice captain?
Yeah.
Ever since we came to America,\nI've been watching over this team as its captain.
But <avatar_name>'s the one who really pulled\nus through. He's put in the effort both on the\nfield and in practice.
The way he's worked to pull this team together\nand move us forward can't be overstated.
Hmm...
And for all of us third years,\nthis really is our final match.
For the next two years, I'm sure he'll take\nthe reins to lead middle school soccer.
And he'll need this sort of experience. It's\nimportant he gets it in such an important match.
What d'you all think?
Morning, <avatar_name>.\nSorry to wake you up so early.
The coach is calling for us.\nCould you come with me?
Come in! Come in.
Thanks for having us.
Tsubasa...
Sorry to wake you up so early.
We just had something to discuss with you,\n<avatar_name>.
With <avatar_name>?
Go ahead, Tsubasa.
Right.
<avatar_name>... Actually,\nI want you to be captain for this next match.
Huh?
Ever since we got to America, I've been\nwatching over this team as the captain.
But I've realized something.
The one who's really been leading this team is...
You, <avatar_name>.
Wow...
So today, for the finals,\nI want you to be our leader.
I think you can do it, <avatar_name>.
So what do you say? Will you be our captain?
Got it! I'll do my best!
Sorry, that's just too much responsibility.
I know you'll do great. I'm counting on you.
Then we'll need to inform the others.
Right. I'll talk to them.
So I thought I'd have <avatar_name>\nbe the captain for the finals today.
Is that alright with everyone?
Sounds good to me! <avatar_name>'s got the drive.
<avatar_name>'s been working crazy hard.
If you're fine with it, I'm fine with it, Tsubasa.
If you think it's fine, then why not?
Well, if it's <avatar_name>,\nthen I guess it's fine.
Sure, why not?
I approve.
I think it's a good idea, too!
Me too.
Whatever you say, Tsubasa!
He's younger than us, but sure, why not?
Coach...
So no objections to <avatar_name>\nbeing the vice captain then?
Not a single objection then.
Racja!









Got it.
Then I'm officially appointing <avatar_name>\nas vice captain for the finals.
Now, go give a speech.
I-I'll do my best!
Your dreams are in good hands, guys!
Is everyone ready to be the best in the world?!
C'mon, no need to be so nervous. Just keep\ndoing what you've been doing, Captain!
No need to be so nervous.\nJust play like you always do!
Hah, that's good to hear!\nYou carry our dreams with you, Vice Captain!
You know it! I can already see our victory parade!
To be honest, I never coulda imagined you'd\nbecome the pillar of the Japanese team.\nYou're somethin' else.
I believe in you, too. I've been right beside you,\nand you've given me good reason to.
If anyone can handle this, it's you. I'll be\ngiving you my full support, so don't hesitate!
Well, that means everyone here recognizes you as\nthe core of the team. It's a heavy responsibility.
Kidding! Well, sorta...
No need to get worked up over being vice captain.\nJust be confident, and play like you always do!
I'm a little annoyed given\nwe're the same age, but congrats!
Listen up, <avatar_name>. Being the vice captain\nmeans that your responsible for the team's future.
No need to be scared.\nYa got all of us here to support ya, don'cha?\nBelieve in yourself and you'll do fine!
Alright!\nThen we're counting on you, <avatar_name>!
Time to take on the world!
Okay, then <avatar_name>\nwill be the captain today.
Go ahead. Say something.
I'll do my best for the team!
Follow my lead, guys!
We're gonna be number one!
Yeah, we'll be here for you.\nWe believe in you, Captain!
Heh, sure, why not? We're with ya to the end!
Obviously! With our skill, that's a given!
To be frank, I never imagined you'd\nbecome captain of the All-Japan team.
But I know better than anyone else that you can\ndo it. I've had an eye on you, and I've no doubt.
You'll be fine, and I'll support you with\neverything I've got. So show us what\nyou can do, Captain!
I see... That's too bad.
I can see where you're coming from, Tsubasa. I\nthink <avatar_name> would make a great captain.
But you were the guy to beat ever since\nelementary school, Tsubasa. And you're\nthe one who led us onto the global stage.
So I think you're the only one\nfit to lead us in the finals.
Sorry about forcing my opinion\non you like this, though.
Thanks, Matsuyama. I never knew\nyou thought of me that way.
Okay, I understand. I'll be your\ncaptain through to the end.
Sorry...
I'll always support you, Captain!
No, I should be the one apologizing.\nI didn't think about how you'd feel.
But I'll be counting on you for today, too!
Yeah, I'm counting on you!
Alright, then I suppose this discussion is over.
We're counting on all three of you for the finals.
Yes, Coach!



Morning, <avatar_name>.\nSorry for waking you so early.
The coach is calling for us. Follow me.
Come in! Come in.
Thanks for having us.
Tsubasa...
Sorry to wake you up so early.
We just had something to discuss with you,\n<avatar_name>.
With <avatar_name>?
Go ahead, Tsubasa.
Right.
<avatar_name>... Actually,\nI want you to be captain for this next match.
Eh?
Ever since we got to America, I've been\nwatching over this team as the captain.
But I've realized something.
The one who's really been leading this team is...
You, <avatar_name>.
...
So today, for the finals,\nI want you to be our leader.
I think you can do it, <avatar_name>.
So what do you say? Will you be our captain?
With pleasure!
I don't think I'm ready... Sorry.
I know you'll do great. I'm counting on you.
Then we'll need to inform the others.
Right. I'll talk to them.
So I thought I'd have <avatar_name>\nbe the captain for the finals today.
Is that alright with everyone?
Sounds good to me!
<avatar_name>'s been working crazy hard.
If you're fine with it, I'm fine with it, Tsubasa.
Well, if it's <avatar_name>,\nthen I guess it's fine.
Sure, why not?
I approve.
I think it's a good idea, too!
Me too.
Whatever you say, Tsubasa!
He's younger than us, but sure, why not?
Not a single objection then.
Racja!









Okay, then <avatar_name>\nwill be the captain today.
Go ahead. Say something.
We're definitely winning this!
Of course! Zróbmy to!
So you're the captain now, huh?\nI figured this might happen eventually,\nbut I never thought it'd be today.
No need to get all worked up about it.\nYou're definitely the right fit.\nHave some confidence, Captain!
I see... That's too bad.
I get where you're coming from, Tsubasa. I think\n<avatar_name> is a great fit for captain.
But you've been the guy to beat ever since\nelementary school. We've worked this hard\njust to keep up with you.
And more importantly, we share your dream,\nTsubasa. That's why we're here.
That's why, for today match, the match that will\ndetermine the best in the world, I want you to\nlead us.
I feel a little bad about forcing\nthis onto you, though.
...Thanks, Misugi, for thinking of me that way.
Okay, I understand. I'll be your\ncaptain through to the end.
I'm so sorry...
You can count on me to support you, though!
No, I should be the one apologizing. As the\ncaptain, I should have thought about your\nfeelings more carefully.
But anyway... I'll be counting on you today, too!
I'll be right behind you!
Alright, then I suppose this discussion is over.
We're counting on all three of you for the finals.
Yes, Coach!



Yo, <avatar_name>. Sorry it's so early.
The coach wants us. C'mon.
Come in! Come in.
Thanks for having us.
Tsubasa...
Sorry to wake you up so early.
We just had something to discuss with you,\n<avatar_name>.
With <avatar_name>...?
Go ahead, Tsubasa.
Right.
<avatar_name>... Actually,\nI want you to be captain for this next match.
Huh?
Ever since we got to America, I've been\nwatching over this team as the captain.
But I've realized something.
The one who's really been leading this team is...
You, <avatar_name>.
Wow...
So today, for the finals,\nI want you to be our leader.
I think you can do it, <avatar_name>.
So what do you say? Will you be our captain?
Absolutely! I'm honored!
I-I can't do it...
I know you'll do great. I'm counting on you.
Then we'll need to inform the others.
Right. I'll talk to them.
So I thought I'd have <avatar_name>\nbe the captain for the finals today.
What does everyone think?
Sounds good to me!
<avatar_name>'s been working crazy hard.
If you're fine with it, I'm fine with it, Tsubasa.
Well, if it's <avatar_name>,\nthen I guess it's fine.
Sure, why not?
Got my vote.
I think it's a good idea, too!
Me too.
Whatever you say, Tsubasa!
He's younger than us, but sure, why not?
Not a single objection then.
Racja!









Okay, then <avatar_name>\nwill be the captain today.
Go ahead. Say something.
I'll do my best to lead you!
You can depend entirely on me!
Yeah, we'll do our best, too, Captain!
Heh, little bit of an ego, don't ya think?\nLooking forward to it, Captain!
You're amazing, <avatar_name>!\nI can't believe you're the captain now!
Heh... You da man, now.
Listen up, <avatar_name>.\nThe captain bears the fate of the entire team.
But don't be scared. You can\nlean on us if you need to. Believe\nin us and carry the team to victory!
I see... That's too bad.
It's not like I don't get what you're saying,\nTsubasa. I think <avatar_name>\nwould make a great captain, as well.
But you've always taken the lead. From\nback in elementary school all the way to\ntoday. It's always been you, Tsubasa.
So be our captain for this match. I think\nthat's your responsibility as the man we've\nbeen chasing all this time, Tsubasa Ozora.
Well, feels kinda weird to push\nmy feelings on you like that, though...
Thanks Hyuga. I never knew you saw me like that...
Okay, I understand. I'll be your\ncaptain through to the end.
Sorry about this...
And we'll support you to the end!
Nah, don't worry about it. My bad\nfor not considering your feelings.
So I'll be counting on you just like always!
I see. Well, I'll be counting\non you today, as well!
Alright, then I suppose this discussion is over.
We're counting on all three of you for the finals.
Yes, Coach!



Junior Youth World Challenge\nThe Finals
Today's the day, folks!
The very first Junior Youth\nWorld Challenge finals!
The favorites to win, the number one\nteam in Europe, Germany, versus...!
The team that dethroned the favorites to win in\nthe semifinals, hailing from el pais del futbol\nitself, Brazil versus...!
The miraculous hometown team who beat both\nGermany and Brazil, America versus...!
The team who crushed Italy, Netherlands, Senegal,\nArgentina and France one after another,\nthe steadily advancing marvel, Japan!
Now which of these teams will be crowned champion\nof this Junior Youth International Tournament?
(They've come so far.)
(Three years ago, when I saw them at Nationals, I\nknew they'd change Japanese soccer forever. And\nnow they've dwarfed all past accomplishments.)
(Especially Tsubasa Ozora. Maybe it was for\nthe best that he didn't go to Brazil sooner.)
(The other players of his generation were fired\nup just to chase his shadow and dream of\ndefeating him. But it made them better.)
(And now, three years later, Kojiro Hyuga has\nnearly caught up with him, and the other players\ncontinue to grow with him driving them.)
(Tsubasa, too. He's grown so much that there's\nno one left in Japan who could rival him.)
(Adding in Misaki and Wakabayashi, who went to\ntrain in France and Germany, they're undoubtedly\nthe right team for the All-Japan Junior Youths.)
(And they've finally arrived here.)
(But this is no place to feel complacent.\nOnce they beat the Germany Junior Youths,\nthat's when the real journey embarks.)
(But this is no place to feel complacent.\nOnce they beat the Brazil Junior Youths,\nthat's when the real journey embarks.)
(But this is no place to feel complacent.\nOnce they beat the America Junior Youths,\nthat's when the real journey embarks.)
(There's still a long road to our dream\nof a Japanese World Cup victory.)
(But winning this tournament\nwill be the first step!)
(Hmm...? Is that...?!)
(The finals--)
(You're finally at a place where you can compete\nto show you're the best in the world, Tsubasa.)
(...)
(Tsubasa, I...)
Roberto!
Oh, Coach Barbas!
Hello!
I thought you'd be here.\nI mean, this is your protege's big moment.
Are you really going to recruit Tsubasa?
Yeah. I thought I'd formally\napproach him after the finals.
He'll get a chance to play these guys again after\nhe comes to Argentina. That's when he'll get his\npayback.
...
Coach Barbas, who do you think\nis going to win today?
Sad to say, but Germany. Even with Tsubasa Ozora,\nthere's no way Japan can defeat them.
The German players are just too much for them. If\nI could scout them, I wonder how many would be\nopen to negotiations...
Well, Brazil... Even with Tsubasa Ozora,\nthere's no way Japan can defeat them.
...Personally though, I'd rather not\nsee Brazil win. Sorry, Roberto.
Sad to say, but the USA. Even with Tsubasa Ozora,\nthere's no way Japan can defeat them.
That Ryan is something else, just\nlike Tsubasa. He's not really the\ntype I'd like to recruit though...
So... If Japan does win, can you put\nthis scouting thing on hold for me?
Huh? Why?
I...
I want a chance to recruit him\nfor my team in Brazil first.
Roberto!
Really?
Roberto!
Okay boys, let's talk.
Today, we're doing it just like\nwe talked about yesterday.
Wakabayashi, go ahead.
We've got to keep an eye on Schneider. He's got\nskills that way outshine what we're used to.
I'm not sure even I can stop that Fire Shot\nhe used at the end of the Brazil game.
Defense, keep Schneider marked,\nand make sure he doesn't get any passes.
Got it!







Heh... When it the time comes, I'll\nstop that ball. With my face, if need be.
Man, that'll hurt!
No pain no gain, I guess.
Ha! Looks like we got a world champ here!\nNo need to be afraid of a little blood.
I mean... The ball's your friend, so taking\na shot in the face won't even hurt... I guess?
We need that kinda dedication.
If you take a shot to the face, Ishizaki, you\nmight end up even uglier than you are now!
Stuff it! Your face isn't what makes\nyou a man... It's what's inside!
Yeah, Ishizaki's all man!
And then there's the goal keeper, Deuter Muller.
He's a big lug, and he has the strength to stop\nmost shots. He's also a lot quicker than he looks,\nso ya really gotta put some pepper on your shots.
So the plan essentially is to keep Schneider from\nshooting and pound as many shots at Muller as\npossible.
That means we have to keep\ncomplete control of the midfield.
But Heine is in the midfield. He's on par\nwith Tsubasa in dribbling and passing.
If we let him move freely, he'll find\na way to get the ball to Schneider.
That's right.
But even if we keep Heine pinned down, we\nstill have Schester and Kaltz to contend with.
They've been playing midfield defense in this\ntournament, but they're usually on the attack...\nand quite dangerous. Keep an eye on them.
They've got one heck of a midfield...
It's going to be rough, Tsubasa, but you\nhave to keep that midfield under control.
Got it. I'll make it happen.
Tsubasa, we'll be right with you.\nYou're not alone in this fight.
Tak!
Germany's strong, but you can handle 'em.\nYou're better now than you were in the scrimmage.
If you use the skills you've been building,\nyou'll get the job done! Believe in yourselves!
Yes, Coach!






Hang on, guys.
What's up?
Let's huddle up before the game real quick.
Oh, good idea.
Okay then, <avatar_name>,\nI want you to give these guys a pep talk.
M-Me?!
Of course! You can count on me!
Way to be. Believe in yourself.
I figured you'd say something like that.
Heh, looks like he's getting into it already!

Let's play like this is the World Cup finals!
Tak!





















Okay, <avatar_name>, time\nto huddle up for a pep talk!
The Japan team we're facing today is not\nthe team we played in the scrimmages.
But that's no reason to fear them.\nWe are the best team in the world.
So play with confidence!
Yes, Captain!





(Father, the time has come.)
(When we win, I'll be the\nbest player in the world.)
(And I'll show the world you were right\nabout how soccer should be played!)
You're full of spirit today.\nYour eyes are gleaming like never before.
Heine.
I feel I'll play the game of my life today.\nSchneider and I will lead Germany\nto the world championship!
Right, we're counting on you, Heine.
Hey hey, what's with you two over here all alone?
Kaltz?
Ah, that's right. Make sure to send some\npasses my way, not just to Schneider!
I'll keep the final balance. You\nthree stay focused on your jobs.
Don't worry about the goal.\nYou all just think about scoring.
Well, if anything goes wrong, I'll be there.
Guys...
Heh.
Right, let's go! We'll win this\nworld championship together!
Darn right!




Time to kick off the finals of the first Junior\nYouth World Challenge with Japan versus Germany!
The massive crowd is already going wild!
And this match, which many say will predict the\nnext World Cup champs, is being broadcast\nworldwide. The world's soccer fans are watching!
Who will win? Current world top Germany, led by\ntheir Young Emperor, Karl Heinz Schneider?
Or will it be All-Japan Junior Youth under\nJapan's football genius, Tsubasa Ozora?
Or will it be All-Japan Junior Youth with\nJapan's football genius, Tsubasa Ozora?
And of course, there's another player on\nthe All-Japan team deserving your attention.
He's been a star in recent games, and for\ntoday's key match he's been named vice captain!
We're approaching the kickoff\nfor this historic match!
Who will be victorious?
Predictions put Germany comfortably on top.
Still, those of us who've played them\nwill tell ya...
Japan has a true well of strength.
Neither team is going to be safe\nletting down their guards\nuntil the final whistle!
(Finals. Each time we've seen a competition\nthrough to this point, it's felt magnificent.)
(There is no tomorrow. We must\nplay with all that we are today.)
(And this is the most important\nfinals match we've made it to yet!)
Hey, let's have a good game out there.
Yeah, let's do our best.
Put your pedal to the metal, man.\nI want to see how you've improved!
I can't make any promises.\nWe'll be playing our best!
Yeah, same here.
Well, do your best, but as long as\nSchneider and I are here, Germany's a shoo-in.
Tsubasa, I'm looking forward to facing you!
Let's all do our best.
We're going to repay you for that scrimmage!
Don't go too hard on us.
Hey, let's have a good game out there.
Of course! We were hoping you'd feel that way.
We've been watching you, and we've seen how\nyou've grown. You can expect only our best.
(Wakabayashi, we were teammates in Hamburg,\nand now it's time we finally face each other!)
(Time to decide who's the world's best!)
(Schneider... I won't let you beat me.)
(Genzo Wakabayashi...)
(Even with all my training in the mountains and\nCoach Gunther recruiting me, I didn't get to\ncompete.)
(And all the while, you kept at it and even\nbecame known as Germany's greatest goalkeeper.)
(So this time I'm going to make it plain.)
(Germany's number one, the world's\nnumber one, is Deuter Muller.)
(Schneider, the humiliation you showed me\nin the scrimmage helped me grow.)
(Now it's time to repay the favor!)
Their goalie keeps glaring at us...
I know you have your plans,\nbut we're after the same thing.
(There will be no mercy for you, Japan!)
(I can hardly believe that I'm getting to play\nin the world championship match!\nMe! Not Wakabayashi or Wakashimazu.)
(Am I really ready for this?)
(No, I can't doubt myself! I got here by\nputting it all on the line every game.)
(I'll protect this goal, regardless\nof what it might cost my body.)
That's Japan's number three goalkeeper, right?
...
Not Wakabayashi or that longhaired one...\nWhat are they thinking, pitting him against us?
It doesn't matter who we're against.\nOur mission is already decided.
Right. Well, since Japan wants to give us such\na nice gift, let us accept it with gratitude!
(It's too bad we don't get to face off\non this grand stage, Wakabayashi.)
Takeshi, it's like we saw in the Brazil game.\nThat goalkeeper is something else.
Yeah. He stopped Carlos's shot\nlike it was barely a trifle.
If we want to score on that guy,\nwe're going to need Tsubasa or Kojiro.
So we need to give them as many\nopportunities to shoot as possible.
Yeah, I'm with you.
Takeshi, let's make sure they get those chances.
We... You mean me, too?!
Yep.
I'm confident I'm the best at\ndrawing out Tsubasa's real skills.
But you're key to bringing out Kojiro's\nbest, Takeshi. We need you out there.
You need me...
You've kept a careful eye on him. You can do it!
You'll be helping Kojiro be the best striker\nin the world through your teamwork.
My play could do that much for Hyuga?
R-Right! I'll do my best!
Today, we're going to help our teammates\nshine, and be the greatest on the planet!
Tak! We're all in this together!
It's about time for the match.
Here we are, the Shutetsu Trio...\nNow all starters. It's like a dream!
I thought I was used to finals matches, but this\nworld championship really piles on the pressure!
And judging by that Brazil match, getting a goal\npast their keeper is going to be a heck of a job.
Heh, but now we've got those plays\nwe hammered out against the Dutch trio!
But we've been playing together for ages.\nIf we work together, we've got a chance!
No doubt. With the three of us\nworking together, we can slay those giants!
Yeah, let's do it!
Roberto, I was hoping you'd come.
It's you...
So, about Tsubasa. Did you think\nabout taking him to Brazil?
Yeah...
But there's someone else\nlooking to recruit him, as well.
What?
Diego Barbas, coach of Argentina Junior Youth.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
So, Tsubasa could be going to Argentina?
Indeed. I'd like to speak to him\nonce the tournament has concluded.
But we've made a little wager.
What wager?
If Japan wins Roberto\ngets him, if they lose, I do.
So if Japan takes the championship,\nRoberto will take Tsubasa to Brazil?
...
Exactly.
My thanks.
I do regret to inform you, Coach Barbas.\nJapan is going to win.
But...
Japan will win!
Schneider, I won't let you\ndefeat me!
It's on, Tsubasa!
Nitta, did you feel like an aura\nfrom their keeper, too?
Yeah... Who is that guy?
You and me have been forwards since our\nbeginnings. We have a striker's instinct for\ngoalies.
This match is going to be\neven harder than we imagined.
Hyuga, that keeper...
Tsubasa... So you sensed it, too.
You've been a forward, and you've become\na striker who guarantees goals.
That keeper won't leave any openings. You\ncan see it, he'll stop every shot that comes.\nWe've never faced anyone like him.
Yeah. But we hafta try.
Of course. It's the only way to win.
We can do this, man.
Tak!
Here I come, Wakabayashi!
Bring it on, Schneider!
Come on, Heine! Idziemy!
We can take Tsubasa!
Alright, let's show 'em a\nthing or two!
We're the best team on earth!
Let's go, Heine!
Just try to stop us!
You'll never outplay us!
Come on, let's go, Misaki!
Even Germany is no match for\nus!
Let's get 'em, Misaki!
We can't lose!
Okay, Takeshi! Zróbmy to!
We're coming for you, Germany!
Watch us work!
Alright, defenders, good positioning.\nKeep that formation.
Of course, Wakabayashi wouldn't\nlet us score that easily.
Yeah, even you can't score\nthat easily from outside the box.
So I just need to break through into\nthe penalty box and take my shot.
Heine, I'll need you to set me up with a pass.
Roger! I'll handle it.
Look at that! Muller just caught\nTsubasa's Drive Shot like it was nothing!
That was pretty weak.
So, who's going to try next?
Bring it! Just try and catch\nme!
Excellent work from Japan's guardian,\nWakabayashi! He's going all out, showing\nhow he became a star in Germany!
And Muller stops Japan's shot flat!
He's stopping every one of Japan's most powerful\nblasts! The Iron Giant will not be moved!
Tsubasa Ozora!
Oof! But the ball is still...
And Schneider...!
Gah! Not bad at all.
He's not just all talk.
That's what you get when you\ncome at me!
This is Japan's key player.
No! Not now!
It's just as I had heard.
This German defense is\nincredible.
But I can still do this!
Well now, you're not so tough\non your own.
Time to put a stop to you!
Ha! Look at him go!
Now you see what I'm made of!
No way I'm letting you win!
You'll never beat me!
Did you see that, Schneider?
He's changed!
You're still not ready yet.
That's for before.
Think for a minute!
You're so easy to read.
You think some cheering from\nyour fans is going to save\nyou?
That technique is amazing!
So this is the Knight of\nBremen?
First Tsubasa... and now this\nguy!
Man! I can't just lose.
I'll never lose one on one!
Your spirit alone won't save\nyou!
That footwork isn't going to\nwin anything!
See what a German forward can\ndo?
No! It can't end here!
You're no match for me.
I lost?!
You're not fit to lick my\ncleats!
H-He beat me!
Stay outta my way!
This can't be...
This is my victory.
What? No!
I've got a technique or two,\ntoo!
It's a Fire Shot! Germany's Young Emperor\nhas hurled a fireball into Japan's goal!
(I hope you got to see that,\nFather... Mother... Marie...)
(The world championship rightfully\nbelongs to Germany!)
(I hope you got to see that,\nFather... Mother... Marie...)
(The world championship belongs to Germany!)
Nice shot, Schneider!
But why isn't Wakabayashi out here?
Yeah. This match would be way more interesting,\nif he were playing.
Well, it's easier this way, for sure.
But it is kind of boring without your rival.
Yeah, I am painfully aware of that.
But if we're talking about winning...\nYou have to admit this is a lucky break.
Ha! Can't argue with that.
Schneider, it's too bad you don't get\nto face your rival, but Heine's right.
We might not be up against Wakabayashi,\nbut our goal is to win... at all costs.
Yeah, you're right.
So let's crush the Japan team!
Are they saying I'm not worthy of Wakabayashi?
Wakashimazu, don't let them get to you.
Right now, you're our goalkeeper. No\none's comparing you to Wakabayashi.
Just keep the ball outta our goal!
My apologies, Tsubasa.
Alright! I'm going to be goalkeeper for the best\nteam in the world! Tsubasa, go score us some\npoints!
Yeah, that's the way! Now it's our turn!
I-I knew it. I can't do this...
Don't let it get you down, Morisaki!
Tsubasa...
But still, I'm not Wakabayashi or Wakashimazu.
Listen, you were goalkeeper for\nNankatsu, the best team in Japan!
Remember, the ball is your friend!\nJust get your whole body in front of it!
Sorry about that, Tsubasa.
Okay! I'm on it! I'm the goalkeeper for All-Japan!
Germany's Young Emperor Schneider\nis a true genius!
Not even Wakabayashi, the Guardian of Japan,\ncould put a stop him!
Did you see that, Wakabayashi?\nI'll win this duel, as well!
(I hope you got to see that,\nFather... Mother... Marie...)
(The world championship rightfully\nbelongs to Germany!)
(I hope you got to see that,\nFather... Mother... Marie...)
(I won't give up!\nThe world championship belongs to Germany!)
Nice one, Schneider!
Scoring a goal on your rival is so much better!
Well, duh!
But I still haven't scored on Wakabayashi\nfrom outside the penalty box.
If I could get one from outside the box,\nand lead Germany to win...\nI could truly call today my victory.
We're still in the middle of this game.
I haven't forgotten... Our top priority\nis to make sure Germany wins.
We'll do this as a team! Come on!
Tak!




No! How could I let that past?!
It's fine, Wakabayashi. We've still got time.
Tsubasa!
We believe in you, Genzo.\nYou'll stop it next time, man.
Don't worry, we can score goals,\ntoo! You can do it, Wakabayashi!
Count on me. He won't be scoring again.
Watch out, Schneider... You're done here!
Łoł! There goes Schneider's incredible\nFire Shot! This time it came in from outside\nthe box to level Wakabayashi!
Schneider drives one in from\noutside the box, and he scores!
Wakabayashi! Victory is mine!
Germany will be taking home this championship!
(I hope you got to see that,\nFather... Mother... Marie...)
(The world championship belongs to Germany!)
(I hope you got to see that,\nFather... Mother... Marie...)
(I won't give up!\nThe world championship belongs to Germany!)
Well done, Schneider! You got\nWakabayashi shaking in his cleats!
Ha! Hits a little harder in a match\nthan it does in practice, doesn't it?
But this is just one step\nfarther forward on our mission.
I can't say I've beaten Wakabayashi\nuntil we win this match!
Racja! When we win this and take\nthe championship, you can also\nrelish Wakabayashi's defeat.
Yeah, so get going, Kaltz.
(But you're not the type to let it\nend there are you, Wakabayashi?)
I can't believe I let one by. I'm sorry, guys!
Schneider scored on Wakabayashi\nfrom outside the box! He's good...Very good.
I stopped him in practice, but he's playing\nmuch harder in the game itself. It sucks,\nbut it shows he really is a top player.
If it wasn't hard, it wouldn't be worth doing.
Tsubasa...
If we won easily without a true opponent,\nthere would be no real glory in the victory.
Let's win this thing!
You're a top player, too, Genzo! Our Guardian.\nWe know you'll keep our net safe!
Heh, easy for you to say.
Right, leave the goal to me.\nI won't let him score again!
(Watch out, Schneider...\nYou're done scoring today!)
This is the power of Germany's Young Emperor!
Schneider has pulled off a hat trick\nin the opening half of the finals!
(Do you see me, world? I am Karl Heinz Schneider!)
Congrats on the hat trick, Schneider!
Well, if I hope to be the best striker on\nthe face of the earth... It's not a bad start.
To pull that off in a finals game...\nI am a bit in awe, and a bit envious.
Gah! I never thought Schneider\nwas that far beyond me, but...
Wakabayashi...
I'm so sorry, guys...
(Wakabayashi, is that really all\nyou have? I'm disappointed.)
No... Has all my hard work since\nthe scrimmage been worthless?!
Wakashimazu...
I'm so sorry. I have failed you, my team.
Agh! I knew I wasn't ready\nfor this level of competition!
Morisaki, calm down. You weren't\nthe only player on the field, and\nthe burden of failure isn't yours alone.
Tsubasa...
No, Tsubasa. This is all on me.
I'm the goalkeeper. I have to take\nresponsibility for the points they scored.
Morisaki...
(So this is the power of Germany's Young Emperor.)
Hahaha, too easy! I knew it-- I'm unstoppable!
Don't get too cocky, Heine. Japan's beaten\nchampion teams before. They may still have\nsomething up their sleeves.
What now? Is that jealousy I smell, Schester?
Ha! Once we've won this match,\nI'll show you who should be jealous!
Agh! Get off me!
Get your head in the game and let's go, Heine!
I'm fine, Schneider. I may look\nrelaxed, but I'm staying sharp.
We won't lose because I dropped the ball.
Good job, Margus! You make us Bremenites proud!
I do wear the number 9\nfor the national team, y'know.
I might not be Schneider, but I still know where\nthe goal is and how to get the ball in it.
Wow! Now that's some luck!\nI actually got to see Margus score a goal!
Yeah, thanks Heine!
Huh? Oh, yeah, nice goal.
Okay then, let's go out and get a few more goals!
That through pass was the smoothest I've seen it.
Yeah, Schester! I knew you could do it!
Thanks! We Bremen boys need\nto show we got what it takes, too!
Listen, I'm a star back in Dresden, too.
Nicely scored, Kaltz!
Yes, the first man on the job is always Kaltz!
I bet Wakabayashi never dreamed\nhe'd let one of mine past!
I bet Wakabayashi just doesn't\nknow how good you really are.
There you go! Boring old\nKaltz is the center of attention!
Who are you calling boring?
What? Do you really think you got style?
Listen, you...
Well, it's not like I scored on Wakabayashi.
That's true. If he'd been there,\nyou never would have scored so easily.
Yeah, he would have stopped it.
Et tu, Schneider? Is Heine's negativity catching?
Yes! Did you see that?\nThat's what I'm talking about!
Nicely done, Kaltz!
But what a shocker! I never\nthought Kaltz could play like that.
Right? He should quit messing\naround and always play like that.
Enough, guys. Let's keep our\nheads in the game. In it to win it.
We have to keep fired up\nuntil we hear the final whistle!
I prefer the usual Kaltz...
I guess he's just realized how\nseriously we need to take Japan.
Maybe so... But it doesn't seem like him.
Okay, team, follow Kaltz's example!\nWe are going to win this thing!
Tak!





The pride of Japan and ace striker,\nKojiro Hyuga, is on fire in this game!
He's done the impossible and scored a\nhat trick against the invincible Muller!
The Fierce Tiger is proving\nunstoppable in this final match!
Did you see that, world? That's\nwhat Japan's ace striker can do!
Tak! That's our ace! That's our Kojiro Hyuga!
I knew you could do it, Hyuga!
Thanks! Just one more bit of proof that I'm on my\nway to being the best striker in the world!
Now, we just have to win, and prove\nto the world that we're number one!
Okay, let's keep this up all the way to the end!
I'm not giving up! There's not a keeper\non earth, who can stop every shot!
Okay, Hyuga and <avatar_name>!\nLet's go!
Come on, Hyuga!
(Right, Tsubasa, you've realized it, too.\nThis is the only way to score on him.)
(This is our only chance!)
Yeah, Tsubasa!
My Neo Drive Shot...
My Neo Tiger Shot...
TOGETHER!


We'll fuse my Neo Drive Shot\nand your Neo Tiger Shot!
Gooo!
We'll try my Neo Tiger Shot and\nyour Neo Drive Shot in unison!
Gyaaah!
Japan has unleashed its secret weapons,\nand fired their most powerful shots!
The Drive Shot and Tiger Shot... as one!
Amazing, the Neo Drive Shot and\nNeo Tiger Shot at the same time?!
It's the Neo Drive Tiger Twin Shot!
Yes! We did it, Hyuga!
We really did, Tsubasa!
It's hard to believe I could\nwork with my rival so well.
Good job, <avatar_name>!
That was an incredible shot!
That was like something out of a dream!
It's our connection that let us take that shot!
You're right! I thought so, too!
Good one, <avatar_name>!
We're the best in the world!
That was the ultimate shot!
Tak! We are number one!
That makes sense! There's no way\nanyone could beat him alone.
You two are incredible!
The impact and speed on that shook the\nfield more than our Twin Shot ever has!
Your hard work really paid off!
Amazing, guys! I've never seen a shot\nwith that much oomph behind it before!
That was way faster than our\nTwin Shot, or the Tachibanas'!
All your hard work has paid dividends!
Two of Japan's strongest shots at once?\nNo way anyone could stop that!
I... I failed?
What was that?!
I've never seen a shot like that!
Hey, what are you upset about? It's not\nlike they can do that more than once.\nDon't beat yourself up!
Yeah, Heine's right. The shot may\nhave been incredible, but it's still\njust one point. Cheer up!
That's right. They can use all the wild shots\nthey want, football is more than grandstanding.
Now let's give Japan a show. Come on!
Wh-What?!


W-Wait, this is...!
Did he stop it?! Amazing!\nMuller caught that incredible shot!
(Master, was that enough?)
Nice catch, Muller!
(Muller really is something else.)
No! He stopped our Twin Shot!
But we can't give up yet!
I'm going to take him head on and score.\nI'll show you why I'm Japan's ace!
That's right! We don't know\nthe meaning of the word "quit"!
No! He stopped our Twin Shot!
How can we score against him?
We're not done yet!
Don't give up yet!\nOur soccer is more than just that one shot!
Yeah, he's right!
It's not over 'til it's over!
We don't know the meaning of the word "quit"!
No! He stopped our Twin Shot!
How are we supposed to score with him in goal?
No way we're giving up now!
What are you talking about? We've\ngot more than just that one shot in us!
Absolutely! We're gonna be number one!
We don't know the meaning of the word "quit"!
Japan... Without Wakabayashi?
(Looks like he's going to shoot!)
(I've had one failure after another\nsince I joined the national team.)
(I saw how good Wakabayashi and Wakashimazu\nwere in practice, and I understood just how wide\nthe gap is in our skills.)
(And in the scrimmage with Germany scrimmage,\nI gave up point after point, even with their aces\nsitting out. I've never felt so incapable.)
(But living through that is\nwhat brought me here today.)
(Wakabayashi and Wakashimazu...\nHernandez and <avatar_name>...)
(And now I can give a little something back to\nGermany, for pushing me through my cowardice!)
(First, I need to assess the\ndefense, and look for openings.)
(Find the weakest spot, and set myself up there.)
(And then...)
Fire!
(Catch it and hold on tight!)
Wh-What?!
Amazing! Has he caught it? Did he stop the ball?!
Morisaki has risen to the pressure of this game,\nand plucked the Fire Shot from the sky!
I-I caught it! I did it, guys!
(Th-That's impossible! How did he get so good?!)
Tak! Yeah, Morisaki! You did it!
Amazing, Morisaki!\nI feel so much better from before!
(It's all thanks to Hernandez's special training.)
(Fantastic, Morisaki.)
(You even caught the Fire Shot...\nI'm so happy for you.)
That was great, Morisaki!\nYou caught the Fire Shot!
Ha! I guess I've gotten better\nthan you thought, Tsubasa!
Tak! I'm glad you're in charge of our goal today!
Yeah, now let's show them who's number one!
Nice shot, Hyuga!
Tak! Thanks for the solid pass, Takeshi!
(Takeshi made a perfect pass\nto help Hyuga play his best.)
(Right! I can't let him do it all!)
Nice shot, Tsubasa!
Thanks to your pass! You're an\nexcellent teammate, Misaki.
(Good one, Misaki. That was a perfect\npass right to where Tsubasa needed it.)
(Okay, I need to pick it up for Hyuga now!)
Good one, Misaki!
That's what we do as the Golden Duo.
Yeah, now let's keep pushing\nour partners onto new heights!
...
What's wrong, Tsubasa?
Man ya gotta admit...\nMisaki really is something.
Thanks to him, I can focus on playing and not\nworry about anything else. That goal just now\nreally made that clear to me.
Yeah, and I can shoot like I do because Takeshi\nis always there with the perfect pass.
That's what partners are for.
Yeah.
When we come together, even if we face a\nhundred or a thousand foes, it doesn't matter.\nWe're the Golden Duo.
I-Ishizaki stopped another blazing\nshot from Schneider with his face!
The ref has stopped the game after\nthe goalkeeper caught the loose ball.
Ishizaki is still lying on the field! Is he okay?
Ishizaki!
Ishizaki!
Ishizaki!
Ishizaki!
Heh... Don't worry! That was nothing...
Whoa...!
And Ishizaki has gotten up!\nIt looks like he's okay!
A-Are you alright, Ishizaki?
You know I've got the guts.\nNo way I'm going down that easy.
Owww!
Don't push it too hard, Ishizaki.
Listen, Tsubasa.
What is it?
Do you remember just how amateur I was at soccer?
And now, thanks to you, I'm on the national team.\nAnd I just blocked a world class shot on my own.
I got to tell you, my soccer\ndreams have all come true.
Ishizaki...
But my new dream is for you\nto become the world's best.
And after we win this tournament,\nI know you'll make that dream come true.
Wh-What are you saying, Ishizaki?
I'm not just talking for myself.\nWe all think the same way.
Yeah, Tsubasa. He's right!
I'm going to help you make your dream\ncome true, because it's mine, too.
Yeah, Ishizaki! Let's take that first\nstep and win this championship!
Tak! I'm going to stop their\nshots even if it scars my face!
They've got a beast there. He's\nstopped Schneider twice with his face!
But just how tough are that guy's head and neck?!
That's a job not even I would do willingly...
Good going, you two!
Heh, the Shutetsu Trio-- together\nforever! We're a perfect combination!
Yeah, now the whole world knows what we can do.
If we keep going like this, pretty soon\nwe'll be known as the All Japan Trio!
Tak!


Those guys did great!
Yeah, they put our coaching to good use!
Y'know, we should be a bit more careful.
We've got to figure out how to beat\nthese guys before it's too late!
Those three use some interesting moves.
They sure do. Maybe we should\nstudy them a bit for our combo.
If we want to be world's best,\nwe have to keep learning!
Wh-What?! How could those guys get past me?
Their teamwork was perfect. With\nthat kind of action, no goalkeeper\nin the world could stop them.
But we Germans are no slouches when\nit comes to combination plays, either.
That's right! We won't let\nthem beat us in any arena.
There's the whistle to end the first half!
Here at this final match, Japan\nis discovering the real value of\neverything they've learned so far!
And the first half ends with Japan\nleading Germany, the favorites to win!
There's the whistle to end the first half!
These two teams are really locking\nhorns in this incredible final match.
The first half ends in a tie score, and\nneither team offering an inch of ground!
There's the whistle to end the first half!
So far, Japan has fought hard to\nkeep up with Germany's pace.
And the first half ends with Germany in the lead.
You've got a great team, Japan.
(And it's not just Tsubasa. All the players I saw\nin Japan three years ago have come so far.)
(Every player here has worked\njust as hard as Tsubasa.)
That was a great first half. It really\nfeels like a proper finals match.\nI can't wait for the final half!
Me, too.
(The finals...)
(That's right. I massaged Tsubasa's hurt leg\nat the All Japan Youth Soccer Tournament.)
(I wish I could be at his side today.\nI wish I could offer him some advice...)
Roberto.
Yes?
I can take a message to Tsubasa, if you want.
...
...
Tell him not to forget what's\non page 52 of the notebook.
Strona 52... Got it.
...
You guys played a great first half!\nYou're playing even better than I hoped!
You've come this far, so there's nothing to say.\nKeep playing your best, and crush the final half!
Yes, Coach!






Finally, just one more half to go.
And then it's goodbye, Tsubasa.
I guess so, Misaki...
I know I said the same thing three\nyears ago, but let's end this with a win.
Tak!
Wakabayashi, Schneider got to you, didn't he?
Yeah... I didn't wanna let him beat me, but...
The team is still ahead, though, you know...
Yeah, I get it. That's all that matters.
No one's scoring on me in the second half,\nthough. Not Schneider or anybody else!
Yeah, Wakabayashi! That's the spirit!
Tak!
Hey, Wakabayashi.
Hey, Wakashimazu.
I wanted to get these guys back for the scrimmage\non my own, but... This second half is all yours.\nBeat Schneider. Win this thing.
Yeah. I'll get them for you.
Wakabayashi...
Yeah. You do that!
(Everything I've done so far has lead to this.\nI have to show Schneider that his hat trick\nin the scrimmage was a fluke!)
(I've still got the strength to win!)
Hey, Wakashimazu.
What's up?
I can tell you're frustrated, man.
Well, I think it's the goalie's job to keep the\nopponent from scoring more than your own team.
What?
I know it's hard, but don't dwell on Schneider.\nThe only thing that matters is the team winning.
...
That actually means something, coming from you.
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
You're right, Morisaki. I can see how\nyour team kept their winning record.
I'll make sure we win this thing.\nBe sure to pay attention!
Make sure you're not all talk!
You're out there for us, too!
(I've worked so hard to get to this.\nI have to show Schneider that hat trick\nin the scrimmage was a fluke!)
(I will pin his feet to the\nturf in the second half!)
Hey, Wakashimazu.
Hey, Wakabayashi.
The only one we have to watch is Schneider.\nAnd right now, even he's no match for you!
You've got this second half!
Wakabayashi...
Tak! I've got this!
Nice one, Morisaki! You stopped Schneider...\nI got to admit, I'm impressed!
Yeah. I think Morisaki's come further\nthan any of us since we got to America.
Come on, that's not true...
I mean, everyone has been encouraging\nme and teaching me so much...
You're goalkeeper for the\nnational team. Now, go do it!
Will do! I'll give it my all!
Great first half, Morisaki.
Thanks, Wakabayashi.
But that wasn't me, that was\nthe team working together.
If we had to depend on my\nskills alone, I don't think...
Oh, come on! Sure, we all defend the\ngoal, but you're the heart... our general.
Wakashimazu...
Have some confidence, Morisaki!
You protect our goal!
Tak! I'll keep 'em out!
(What a great team, these All Japan Youths.)
(Everyone, on the field and on the bench,\nis united in trying to win this match.)
(A team like this can't lose.\nIsn't that right, guys?)
You're still letting them have midfield!\nHold your marks and push in!
Defense, you're weak on the tackle!\nKeep them back! Stop them sooner!
R-Right.
Sorry, Sir.
Ease up, Coach.
What, Schneider?
The Japan team is good! They're just\nas skilled, and as tough, as we are.\nThey're a serious opponent.
But Germany is going to win.
We must defend the legacy of German soccer!
We have a long, noble history\nbehind us, one of honor and glory!
We can't allow that legacy to be broken\nso easily by this Japanese team!
Isn't that right, guys?
Tak!





Schneider... Boys...
Idziemy! We will bring the trophy home to\nGermany and preserve our honor in Europe!
Tak!





(No... This is my fault. If only\nI hadn't let them score...)
(If Master were here, I bet he'd be\nfurious at how feeble I've become.)
(How can I ever apologize to him,\nafter he allowed me to join this\ntournament despite my weaknesses?)
Muller...
Yes, Schneider?
We're counting on you in the second half.
...
(Trust me, Schneider. Japan\nwill not score a single point!)
(I got my dukes up, and I'm ready to fight.\nFor the Master and for Germany!)
That was a great first half, team! You showed me\nhow much you've developed as fine young players!
You've come this far, so there's nothing to say.\nKeep playing your best, and crush the final half!
Tak!






Finally, just one more half to go.
And then it's goodbye, Tsubasa.
I guess so, Misaki...
I know I said the same thing three\nyears ago, but let's end this with a win.
Tak!
(I haven't scored a single goal\nin the most important game of my life!\nWhat am I doing?!)
Hyuga, relax.
We've still got a whole half left. You're our\nace striker! You'll get us over the finish line.
Thanks, Tsubasa...
Tak! I've got this!
I'm going to be a world class striker.\nNo way am I going scoreless in these finals!
Right on! If anyone can do it, Hyuga can!
We believe in you, Hyuga!
(I'm the national team forward, but what good is\nthat if I can't score in the most important match\nof our lives?)
Don't fret, Nitta.
Urabe?
That Muller's an incredible\ngoalkeeper, but no one is perfect.
That's right! Keep at it, and your\nchance will come! You got this!
Ishizaki? What are you doing here?!
Heh, I can't let Urabe be the only cool one.
Listen, you...
(Thank you, guys.)
(I won't let you down!)
(The ideal is to be a playmaker and create\nscoring opportunities, but that's not working\nin this match.)
(I'll never make it to Brazil like this!)
He's right, man. You've always been the guy\nwho finds the perfect chance to score, right?
Don't get down, Tsubasa.
There's still time! If anyone can do it, you can!
Aw, guys...
(They're right. These guys have\nbeen with me since grade school.)
Thank you. I'll show you, you weren't wrong\nabout me! I'll get us the championship!
Yeah, that's the Tsubasa we know!
We're scoring better than I'd imagined!
Yeah, even our reserves are finding goals.
Sounds like it's our time to shine, man!
Oh, yeah, sure...
(Kazuo, that wasn't a compliment...)
(What a great team, these All Japan Youths.)
(Everyone, on the field and on the bench,\nis united in trying to win this match.)
(A team like this can't lose.\nIsn't that right, guys?)
What the heck are you guys doing out\nthere?! You're better than they are!\nYou should be in the lead!
Midfield, defense, you're not holding your\nmarks! You have to stop them... and fast!
Y-Yes, Sir.
Sorry, Sir.
Ease up, Coach.
What, Schneider?
The Japan team is good! They're just\nas skilled, and as tough, as we are.\nThey're a serious opponent.
But Germany is going to win.
We must defend the legacy of German soccer!
We have a long, noble history\nbehind us, one of honor and glory!
We can't allow that legacy to be broken\nso easily by this Japanese team!
Isn't that right, guys?
Racja!





Schneider... Boys...
Idziemy! We will bring the trophy home to\nGermany and preserve our honor in Europe!
Tak!





(No... This is my fault. If only\nI hadn't let them score...)
(If Master were here, I bet he'd be\nfurious at how feeble I've become.)
(How can I ever apologize to him,\nafter he allowed me to join this\ntournament despite my weaknesses?)
Muller...
Yes, Schneider?
We're counting on you in the second half.
...
(Trust me, Schneider. Japan\nwill not score a single point!)
(I got my dukes up, and I'm ready to fight.\nFor the Master and for Germany!)
Muller, good job in that first half.\nWe're counting on you in the second.
No worries. I won't give up a\nsingle point. Not to anyone.
These skills are the reason\nMaster let me down off the mountain.
(He's playing for his Master, huh?)
(Well, Father, I will score, and\nwin this match for you, too.)
Never mind the score, that was a great first\nhalf! You showed me how much you've grown!
You've come this far, so there's nothing to say.\nKeep playing your best, and crush the final half!
Yes, Coach!






Finally, just one more half to go.
And then it's goodbye, Tsubasa.
I guess so...
I know I said the same thing three\nyears ago, but let's end this with a win.
Tak!
Łoł! These Germans... Their offensive\nmaneuvering is outta this world!
Yeah. And it's not just Schneider.
If we could control midfield, we could take\nthe initiative, but they're just too good.
You're right. That's why we each have to\nkeep at it. We have to think as a team.
Misugi...
Well then, I guess we better check the defensive\nformation again and find out where to patch\nthings, right?
And we have to stop giving up points!
Let's talk about midfield!
We have to score more!
Yeah, I'll wrack this empty head of mine.
Racja! First, let's change the team pace up a bit.
Okay, if we all think this through,\nwe'll find a way.
Yeah, this match is really a test for us forwards.
If we want to win, we'll have\nto find a way past Muller.
We have to try everything we can think of!
We'll run until our feet\nfall off, and then we'll fly!
(What a great team, these All Japan Youths.)
(Everyone, on the field and on the bench,\nis united in trying to win this match.)
(A team like this can't lose.\nIsn't that right, guys?)
You guys are looking good! Japan's\nfielding a great team, but you have\nthe strength to stop them.
Keep it up in the second half, and Germany\nwill be taking home the championship!
Tak!






Good work out there, Schneider. You got\nsome good goals off of Wakabayashi.
Yeah, but I'm still not satisfied.
I'm a game-winning striker.\nI still need to score!
And right now, I can still\nscore against Wakabayashi.
We're counting on you, Schneider.
(Wakabayashi... You're the one who\nmade me excited to play again.\nAnd no one can stop me now.)
You don't seem happy that\nwe're winning, Schneider.
...
You can't hide it from me.\nI've known you too long.
Are you really that sad you can't\nscore against Wakabayashi?
Of course, I am!
I swear, I'm going to score against\nWakabayashi in the second half. Germany\nwill win, and I will beat Wakabayashi!
If anyone can do it, it's you, Schneider.
(Wakabayashi, if anyone can\nunderstand this bright blue flame\nburning in Schneider's soul, you can.)
(He's going to send a Fire Shot your way\nthis half that will turn you to ashes!)
Schneider, we're winning, and you're\nscoring. Why aren't you happy, dude?
You don't seem happy that\nwe're winning, Schneider.
And it doesn't seem to be\nthat you haven't scored, either.
...
Are you really that sad you can't\nface off against Wakabayashi?
Yeah, there's nothing I can do\nabout it, but I can't let it go.
Well, you'll just have to face him after you get\nback to Germany, and join a major pro team.
Right now, just think about winning this match.
Yeah, yeah, I know. I am the team captain.
Oh, hey, where's Heine?
Hey, yeah, I don't see him. Where'd he run off to?
(Wait, he's not...)
Ugh... Just a little more. Just hang on...
(For me, for Schneider... For\nGermany's world championship...\nHang in there, leg...)
I had a feeling it'd be something like this.
Kaltz?!
Your old injury from the Brazil game\nhurts, right? You pushed it too hard.
Kaltz, don't tell the others.
Why?
I can still play!
I won't let us lose because of my\ninjury. It won't be like at the\nGerman championship! Not again!
...That guy. He's got some guts.
(If he's got that German spirit, he'll be fine.)
(And it's about time for my showdown, too.)
Okay, it's showtime! Let's make it happen, guys!
We're taking this championship!
Yeaaah!





(I haven't seen Tsubasa like this since\nthe National MS Soccer Tournament.)
(All he could think about was winning, and he\ngot so fired up he started acting a bit crazy.)
(I hope he doesn't end up\nlike that again, though.)
(Roberto, I don't know if you're watching this\ngame, or if you're even in America right now.)
(But I'm going to win, Roberto! I'm winning\nthis championship, and joining you in Brazil!)
Hey, Tsubasa.
Oh, Mr. Katagiri...
Page 52 of the notebook.
Huh? What the...?
I'll see you later.
(Strona 52...)
!
(Wait, could it be... Roberto?!)
Hmm... Strona 52?
What did Mr. Katagiri have to say?
I think I told you, but I have a notebook\non soccer strategy that Roberto gave me.
It's got all the stuff Roberto Hongo, who\nused to play for the Brazil national team,\ntaught me when I was a kid.
It's a notebook he wrote out for\nme full of stuff about soccer.
And on page 52 it says...
!
Oh! Now I see! I get it, Roberto!\nI know what you're trying to tell me!
What does it say?
Did you remember?
On page 52, it talks about...
Yeah, I did. Page 52 talks about...
How soccer is all about having fun!
Come on, tell me!
Tell me later.
Tak! You should know this,\nso I'll let you in on the secret.
Okay then, let's go!
Well, it's a bit longwinded, but here we go...
"Tsubasa, what makes soccer so fun for you?"
It's the most loved,\nmost popular sport in the world.


"I think it's because soccer is\nthe purest, freest sport there is."
"Once you're on the field, you're free to\nplay... free to think and act for yourself."
There are boundless possibilities with ten\ncomrades focusing on one ball and one battle.
"Soccer is freedom. What will\nyou do in the middle of that field?"
"You can do anything you want. You can dribble,\npass, or shoot. You can just stand still."
If you pass, you can pass forward, side, back.\nAnywhere is okay. The same with dribbling.
Soccer is freedom, Tsubasa.\nThat's what I love about the game.
And if you're going to keep playing, I want you\nto learn to love it like I do, more than anyone."
That's what it says on page 52 of the notebook.
<avatar_name>,\nI think you love soccer just like I do.
So you'd do well to remember this, too.
Okay, time for the second\nhalf. Let's get out there!
Halftime is now over, and cheers\nonce more fill the crowded stadium!
Japan is currently in the lead,\nbut can they keep this pace up and\nwin their first world championship?
Or will Germany and their Young Emperor\nturn the tables and take home the win?
It's time for the kickoff\nof this fateful second half!
Halftime comes to an end, and\ncheers resound through the stadium!
These two perfectly matched teams are\nlocked in combat, creating a fitting end\nto this grand championship!
When the final whistle blows, will Japan\nsucceed in taking the inaugural crown?
It's time for the kickoff\nof this fateful second half!
Halftime comes to an end, and\ncheers resound through the stadium!
The German team under their Young Emperor\nhas been demonstrating their skills, establishing\na lead in this thrilling final game!
But the Japanese side has been\nlearning from every match, and they've\nproven that they're still in this!
When the final whistle blows, who will\nbe victorious and have the honor of\ntaking home this inaugural crown?
It's time for the kickoff\nof this fateful second half!
(Strona 52...)
(Mr. Katagiri has seen the notebook, but\nhe can't remember the whole thing, right?)
(And if he'd received that message before\nthe game, he would have told me earlier.)
(And that advice is just what\nI needed for this last half.)
(Roberto must be...)
(Roberto must be watching the game right now!)
(He's watching me play!)
Roberto! Heeey!
It looks like Tsubasa's going full throttle!
Don't get ahead of yourselves, Japan!
Kaltz!
He spit it out!
His toothpick is gone!
(What's that supposed to mean?)
Tak! Zróbmy to!
The Japanese might have their Japanese spirit,\nbut we have a German warrior spirit, too!
It's time we showed these guys\nwhat German heart means!
Tak! Everybody follow Kaltz's lead!
And there's the final whistle!
They did it! Japan has won the championship!
Japan is the champion of the first\nJunior Youth World Challenge!
They've toppled Germany, who had been called\nunbeatable, and will now be crowned champions!
Not that Germany didn't put up a good fight!\nWe saw some wonderful play out there!
Both teams deserve our appreciation\nfor giving us a fitting end to this tournament!
And there's the whistle!
Even on this grand stage to determine the best\nin the world, the winner remains uncertain!
It's all down to overtime now!
And there's the final whistle!
Germany is the winner!\nTheir indomitable team is the champion of the\nfirst Junior Youth World Challenge!
Hard as Japan fought, the crown\nremained just out of reach.
You all played so well in both halves.\nI know you're exhausted, body and mind.
Not a bit!
That really was mentally draining...
Me neither, <avatar_name>!
I've never been so excited!\nPlaying soccer at this level is amazing!
Come on, <avatar_name>.\nYou're tougher than that.
Seriously, I'm so happy we get to play\nsome more of this amazing match!
Tak! So cheer up,\n<avatar_name>!
You know, the elementary school\ntournament finals went into overtime, too.
Yeah, Misaki, and the MS\ntournament this year did, too.
Really? It's almost like fate!
We won both of those matches, so\nI guess overtime is good luck for us.
Racja! So, let's give it even more\nin overtime! Let's win this thing!
Alright!





(Everyone follows Tsubasa so naturally.\nHe really is a great captain.)
(I'll leave the overtime to him, then...)
Right, Vice Captain! Get your team fired up!
All eyes are on us, boys, let's relish it!
We're going to win this, no doubt!
Fight on! No regrets! No holding back!
Tak! Think how lucky we are to be here!
Racja! And it's gonna end in victory!
For sure! We've come this far,\nso no way we can lose now!
You said it! Let's beat the Germans\nand become world champs!
Of course! We're gonna use everything we got!
Tak! We've gotta win!
Alright guys! Fire yourselves up for overtime!\nWe knew being the best in the world wouldn't be\neasy!
Tak!
(Everyone follows Tsubasa and <avatar_name>\nso naturally. They've become so reliable.)
(It was a sudden appointment,\nbut he's really a great captain.)
(I can trust them to handle the rest of the game.)
We've got a little time, boys, so rest up.\nThe overtime is going to be rough.
Yeah, it is.
Ugh...
Hey, Heine, what's wrong?
N-Nothing! Nothing at all!
Wait, it's not your leg, is it?
Listen, I said it's nothing!
Ngh!
Heine, you did great out there.
So, it's okay...
No! Don't take me out of the game!
Look at you! You can't play with that leg.\nYou'll bring the team down with you!
Okay, let me ask you then...
If it were you, Schester, and someone\nsaid "You're out of the game!,"\nwould you just smile and say "Sure!"?
Th-That's...
I am the German midfield!\nWithout me, Japan will take control\nand how will we win then?!
Whoa, come on there, Heine. We\ncontribute out there, too, y'know.
I know! I know... It's just...
Schester, Kaltz! In this\novertime, you move forward.
Huh?!
With you two up front, I want you...
...To be Heine's legs.
Huh?!
Schneider!
Schester and Kaltz will steal the ball,\nthen Heine can manage it from there.
That's the best option open to\nus right now. What do you say?
Well, you're the captain. All we can do\nis follow your lead, right, Schester?
Yeah, I think it may be best.
Okay, then. Heine, we're counting on you.
I'll take care of it! If I get the ball,\nI'll get it to where it needs to be,\nanywhere on the field.
With the other two midfielders moving up,\nyou'll be hard pressed on defense.\nSorry, you defenders will need to step up.
Don't worry. No matter what\nhappens, they will not score.
We're national team players, too, y'know!\nWe'll stop the ball, no matter what.
So you make sure to score, okay?
Tak! We're going to win this thing!
We're going to give this overtime match all\nwe've got! We're taking home this championship!
Yeaaah!







The intermission comes to an end,\nas the players retake the field.
This has been a long finals match, and it seems\nlady victory is playing hard to get today.
Both noble teams have struggled valiantly,\nand this overtime will be the final test of\ntheir already tired bodies.
But both teams look toward victory\nwith eyes unclouded by distractions!
And so, who will be laughing at the end of this\ngrueling match? Will it all end in a shootout?
And the first overtime half begins!
We're going to be number one!
Germany will take home the\ncrown!
The whistle ends the first half of the overtime!
Japan has created an opportunity for themselves!\nWill they keep hold of it to the end?
Or will Germany turn the tables and win?
The first half ends with Japan in the lead!
The whistle ends the first half of the overtime!
These teams are in a deadlock! The\ngame remains tied even in overtime!
This has been a match truly fitting this rivalry,\nbut who will break through for the win?
And the teams are tied!
The whistle ends the first half of the overtime!
Is Japan's fatigue after this long\ncampaign beginning to show?
Or could it simply be that Germany's\nwaiting to unleash their true strength?
The first half ends with Germany in the lead!
Tak!
I-I've been fine up 'til now, but\nsuddenly I'm a ball of nerves!
We have to keep this lead in the second half...
That's a dangerous train of thought, Ishizaki.
What?
Tsubasa's right. Germany's gonna play this\nsecond half as if their lives depend on it.
Tak!
Right. We have to keep pushing, keep scoring.
Ah, I get it.
Right, let's start this half on the offensive!
Tak!

Just a little more... We're almost there!
If we focus only on defense, there's a chance we\nmight be crushed.


Let's tighten up our defense.
No time to be passive. Go on the attack!
So you're saying this is going\nto be a true test for our defenders!
Tak! Shore up our walls and keep 'em out!
I reckon maybe then we oughta use\nthe same strat Hirado used, yeah?
Okay folks, listen up.
Germany's gonna come at us guns blazing.\nWe can't just sit and wait for them.
The best defense is a good offense, right?
Well then, how about the strategy we used at\nAzumaichi? It's perfect for times like this!
Here's what we do.
I see... That's a nice, logical plan.
Yeah, that sounds good. Okay then,\nthat's our strategy for the second half.
Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Yes, Coach!






We're losing.
We might actually lose this...
They said we were the best...
...
Listen. Being called the best\ndoesn't mean you're gonna win.
Victory is what shows who's best.
Man, Schneider.
I swear, I will score and reverse this lead.
Even if Wakabayashi is in goal, I will score!
Get me the ball! I will score!
I'm in this, too! I'll send you perfect passes!
This is the perfect time for\nthe Trickster to go to work.
We came here to win.
We're going to fight to the very end!
We're almost done, hold nothing back! For victory!
Tak!







Racja!
What is going on out there?!
We're struggling, but so is Germany.
This isn't about stamina anymore. It's about will.
Racja!
Since our skills are evenly matched, we'll\nhave to win on passion. That's real soccer!
Tak! And no one can outmatch us in spirit!
Okay then, let's give it\neverything we've got left!
Absolutely!

I can't believe we're still tied...
We can win this, as long as we don't give up!


To win, we have got to score.
Tak!
Can we all go on the attack now?
I'm going to get a goal for sure!
Closing the game is what strikers are for!
Right on! That's the kind of team that wins!
Tak! When you get the ball, move it\nforward. Think about your teamwork!
If that's the idea, I've got the perfect plan.
It's that secret move we worked\nout at Hanawa! Lemme explain...
I see. That strategy makes a lot of sense.
Yeah, that sounds good. Okay then,\nthat's our strategy for the second half.
Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Yes, Coach!



If we want to win we have to score, no matter what\nit takes...


Yeah, of course!\nThat's what it means to be a striker!
Us goalkeepers really feel the pressure when\nstrikers don't let up long enough for us to\nbreathe.
You've really been watchin' me closely,\neh <avatar_name>? Good eye.
Heh. Looks like you know\nall about bein' an ace striker.
Right. Then you know that a striker carries the\nfate of his team. And you have to be willing to\naccept that.
You have a way to get yourself psyched\nup for games? I'd like to hear that, too.
You're a striker, too, Tsubasa.\nA bit late to get advice from me, don'cha think?
Well, whatever. Might as well pass on what I know.
<avatar_name>, you've seen\nme work. You should understand how to\nfind the resolve it takes to carry a team.
I'm gonna focus everything on that ball,\nand kick it through the back of the net!
It's time I taught you how I prepare\nmyself mentally for the moment of truth.
Listen up. The best time to prepare\nfor those do-or-die moments...
I see... Wouldn't expect less of Hyuga.
Alright, then I'll give it\na shot for the next half, too!
Okay then, that's our strategy for the second\nhalf. Captain, keep those orders coming!
Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Yes, Coach!






Freakin' Japan! They never give up!
I bet they're saying the same thing about us.
Heine, how's your leg holding up?
We're almost done, right?\nI'll hold together, don't worry.
You know, this is the first time we've\never had to play this hard. I'm feelin' it.
Japan is just as tired.\nNow, it's a battle of will.
German spirit vs. the Japanese spirit. We will\nwin, and preserve the honor of all of Europe!
We will fight to the bitter end, and win!
Tak!







We're almost out of time!
We can't lose now, not after all\nthis! But we're in bad shape...
Heh... Now this is a turnaround.
Whadda you laughing about?
See that look on Tsubasa's face?
We still have time! The match isn't over\nuntil the whistle blows! Don't give up yet!
Ugh. Man, that Tsubasa. He's enjoying this!
When you think about it, he's been through\nthis kind of back-and-forth tons of times.
Racja!
Tsubasa! We will turn this around!
Tak!
Okay, guys, let's do it! It's ours for the taking!
Alright!


Yep. We know the strength\nneeded better than anyone.


Now's when we need our ace to win the game!
Everything's on the line!
Yeah, exactly! The key to\ncontrolling the game now is the ace!
The ace's passion can boost the whole team.\nAnd even raise the spirits of the defense, too!
You've been watching me from the sidelines,\n<avatar_name>, so I think you should know by now.
<avatar_name>...
This is where all my experience thrives.
I've been sent out to change the flow tons\nof times, since I was in elementary school.\nI know a bit about how hard it is.
...
And I've been watching you this whole time.\nYou have the skills, and the heart to do this.\nYou can do this.
Do you have a minute, Tsubasa?
We believe in you.
Misugi.
Ever since elementary school,\nI've been sent out in the middle of losing games.\nI believe you know just how difficult that can be.
If you're set on this, Captain, I'll teach\nyou how I prepare myself mentally.
So when I'm watching a match, I prepare myself\nfor it by thinking about how I might be useful.
I've been sent out to change the\nflow tons of times, since I was little.
Yeah. It'll be tougher to change the way\nthe game's goin' now that it's half over.
If you don't mind, could you tell me how you\nmentally prepare yourself for going on the field?
I understand. Now, listen up.
Oh, I see. So you always do that, Misugi...?
Alright, then I'll give it\na shot for the next half, too!
And take control of the game!
Okay then, that's our strategy for the\nsecond half. Captain, keep everyone in line!
Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Tak!






No matter what, we can't let them score again.\nWe're gonna need an all-or-nothin' gamble.
Right. It's time for Ultimate Formation!
Racja!
Ultimate Formation... Well, in that case...!
Do you all have a minute?
<avatar_name>, Ultimate Formation\nwas our specialty at Furano.
Ultimate Formation! In that case...
Do you all have a minute?
Ultimate Formation was our specialty at Furano.\nLet me explain how it works.
I see. We might be able\nto make that strategy work.
Yeah, that sounds good. Okay then,\nthat's our strategy for the second half.
Okay then, that's our strategy for the second\nhalf. Captain, keep those orders coming!
Okay guys, we're just inches from that trophy.\nLet's give it all we've got!
Yes, Coach!



Listen carefully...


Just a hair's breadth from a world\nchamp victory. I'm a little nervous...
Margus, don't start celebrating yet or\nyou'll tangle up those long legs of yours.
Heine's right, Japan's going to be\nplaying their hearts out, so stay sharp.
Why's everybody ganging up on me? Gimme a break!
Haha!



Guys, we are close to winning this\nthing, but we're still not home free yet.
We have to keep at it until the whistle blows.
And when this match is over, we better make sure\nthat we're the ones seated atop the throne!
All the way!







This seemingly endless tournament has all\ncome down to this final half. If the score\nremains tied, it all ends in a penalty shootout!
Both of these teams have fought tooth and nail,\nand either one could walk away a winner today.
How will this Junior Youth World Challenge\nfinally end?!
It's time for the kickoff to this\nfateful second half of overtime!
We're winning this, Germany!
We're not letting that happen,\nJapan!
Is right in the moment!
I'll put into play everything I've learned!
G-Goal! It's a goal!
It's the Neo Drive Tiger Twin Shot! Japan's\nstrongest shot just got an eleventh-hour boost!
The shot that puts an end to the\nworld's fiercest competition would\nof course come from those two!
And there's the final whistle!
Yes! They did it! Japan wrested control in the\nfinal half and has won the championship!
Japan is the champion of the first\nJunior Youth World Challenge!
They've toppled Germany, who had been called\nunbeatable, and will now be crowned champions!
Not that Germany didn't put up a good fight!\nWe saw a wonderful display of skill out there!
Both teams deserve our appreciation for\ngiving us a fitting end to this tournament!
And the whistle blows to end the overtime!
Skill against skill, will against will...\novertime ends with no clear winner!
Their fates will be decided in a penalty shootout!
But before that, let's congratulate both of these\nincredible teams on a stellar performance!
And there's the final whistle!
And after this grueling final match, the\ngoddess of victory smiles on Germany!
The German players, who have been called\nunbeatable, are now crowned the champions!
Hard as Japan fought, they\ncould not squeeze out a win.
I-It's over...
We just couldn't make it happen!
But we didn't lose...
Racja!
Man, staking the world championship\non a shootout is a lotta pressure...
In the end, it's all about them nerves!
True enough. We have to stay strong for this!
M-My legs are shaking...
I'm going to score and be a hero!
Let's enjoy this to the end, guys!
Well, I can't exactly say\nyou shouldn't be nervous.
But it's exciting, too, isn't it?\nIt's a weird feeling.
Right? It's like, there's a rarefied\nair to this intensity. Enjoy it!
You guys are incredible.
At this point, there's not much left to say.
Believe in yourselves.\nGo out there and win that championship!
Yes, Coach!



Now, it's just the penalty shootout.


Remember to have fun, guys!
Do your best!
We'll win the shootout and become world champs!
<avatar_name>, you really are something else,\nif you take pleasure in this tension.
Ha! We got to play all this time in a world\nchampionship game! I couldn't be happier!
Hey, now, let's stay focused here, Captain!
Haha!






Heh! Laughing does kinda ease the tension.
Wait... Was that the idea all along?\nYou guys are something else!
Ha!
Use your nerves to push you\nthrough, and we'll be okay!
At this point, there's not much left to say.
Believe in yourselves.\nGo out there and win this championship!
Yes, Coach!



Alright! Let's win this thing.


I'm going to stop their shots and be a hero!
You can do it, Wakabayashi!
Yeah, I'll handle it. I'll stop every\nball, even if it breaks my arm!
We're counting on you, Wakashimazu!
W-We've made it this far!\nI'm going to be a hero, too!
You seem more alert than usual, Morisaki.
At this point, there's not much left to say.
Believe in yourselves. Go out\nthere and win this championship!
Yes, Coach!






It's over.
I can't believe it. We couldn't beat them.
Well, we gave it everything we\ncould. It just wasn't enough.
He's right. Don't get too down, you two.
Schneider!
There's still a chance. We\ndon't have time to mope.
Right. If we win this penalty\nshootout, we still win.
This is what I came down from\nthe mountains for. Leave it to me.
Men! The outcome of all of our\nhard work hangs on this shootout!
We will win!
The world championship belongs to Germany!
Tak!







And there it is, the absolute final whistle!
Yes! They did it! Japan dominated the\nshootout and has won the championship!
Japan is the champion of the first\nJunior Youth World Challenge!
They've toppled Germany, who had been called\nunbeatable, and will now be crowned champions!
Not that Germany didn't put up a good fight!\nWe saw a wonderful display of skill out there!
Both teams deserve our appreciation\nfor giving us a fitting end to this tournament!
After a fierce final match, it's all finally over!
Germany dominated the shootout!
These two fierce competitors were even\nto the end, but Germany eked out a win!
Japan was just inches from victory, but\nsadly just couldn't take that final step!
Champions! All Japan Junior Youth\nis the world champion!
W-We won!
Champions!
Racja!
Tsubasa!
We're number one!
We're the best in the world!
The team has hoisted Tsubasa and\nthe others up on their shoulders!
Woohoo! We did it!
We won!
We won the whole thing!
We WON!
We did it, <avatar_name>!
We couldn't have done it without you!
No, everyone contributed!
I worked hard for all of us!
You don't have to be humble about it!\nNow's the time to be proud and soak in the glory!
Don't be humble! Own it! Stand tall!
Oh, cut that out! You were amazing!
See, even Ishizaki says so!\nGo on, <avatar_name>,\nyou've earned a little glory.
This victory... It's...
The team has hoisted Tsubasa\nup on their shoulders!
Woohoo! We did it!
We won!
We won the whole thing!
All Japan is world champion!
Tsubasa! You really are incredible!\nYou crazy fool, you!
Thanks, Ishizaki.
This is Tsubasa's victory!
We won because you all played so hard!
No, everyone was a part of this!
Yeah, that's right!
The whole team earned this win.
Victory!
Yeaaah!



All Japan is world champion!















Yeah, that's the Tsubasa we know!


(World champs... Our dream came true.)
(I'm so glad... I'm so glad\nI never gave up on soccer!)
Congratulations, Japan.
All I've left to say is, I'm happy for you.
The championship... Amazing.
I knew you could do it, Tsubasa!
Japan has a team worthy of being champions.
The stadium is filled with cheering\nand applause for our winners!
...
We... lost?
We lost. We really did.
Yeah, they were certainly\ntougher than they looked...
No!
No! No! Nooo!
Heine!
Settle down, Heine!
Schneider! I can't take it! We were so close!
Before you start in on the regrets,\nthere's something we should do.
Huh?
We have to go congratulate Japan.\nThose guys played their hearts out.
That's the true heart of sports\nand of soccer, Heine.
...
Alright.
And there are the tears. The incredible rush of\nemotion is overwhelming the All Japan Youth team!
As the Junior Youth World Challenge champs,\nthey are now the reigning champions of the world!
These players represent the pinnacle of Japan's\nsoccer scene. They must all be so proud!
Congratulations, All Japan Junior Youth!
Congratulations on your win, Japan.
Hey, Schneider...
There aren't any doubts here. You're number one.
Scoring a hat trick in the finals...\nYou're a better player than I'd thought.
But we're not through yet. I'll see you again,\nand we'll see who's the best striker.
It looks like you're joining the\nfight over world's best striker.
I'm not losing that one. We'll\nsettle this next time we meet.
I can't believe your dribbling and passing\ngot you all this far! I never imagined...
I hate to say it, but... I guess you're good.\nSee? I've got an open mind.
You should feel proud. You're only\nthe second player in the world\nI've given that nod of approval.
(At the scrimmage, I never\nimagined his techniques would\nimprove anywhere near this much.)
(Well, if he can keep growing as a player, then\nso can I. I should be grateful he showed me that.)
After I went and coached you, you stopped us\nGermans in our tracks. Man, I messed up, didn't I?
Hey, I was just messing with you. My bad.
Congrats on the win. But next time, you're ours!
I gotta admit, you're something else.\nNot many could stop our offense like that.
I gotta admit I'm impressed,\nthough. Congrats on the win.
Sorry, but let's forget the\njersey trade for now, okay?
Cause this fight between us\nhas just started, you know?
Gotcha.
Next time...
Next time it's the World Cup!
Right. And we won't lose.
Wakabayashi, I'll be seeing you in the Bundesliga.
Right... But I'll still be beating you.
Schneider, you pushed me...\nhelped me grow. Thank you.
...
I guess next time it's my turn.
(I bet the next time we face off,\nSchneider's going to be even tougher.)
(But I promise, I'm not done improving.\nI'll beat him next time, too!)
Hey, number 20. What's your name?
M-Me?
Morisaki. Yuzo Morisaki.
Yuzo Morisaki.
I'll remember it.
(Morisaki... You're still not at Wakabayashi's\nlevel, but you share something with him.)
(You have his iron grasp.)
(You go for that ball with all you have.\nYou're a great keeper without a doubt.)
Right, guys. Let's go.
We gave it a good fight. We played a fair game.
We have nothing to be ashamed\nof. We can go home proud!
Tak!







And the German Junior Youth team leaves\nthe field just ahead of their Japanese rivals.
The stadium echoes with thunderous applause\nfor these brave runner's up, Team Germany.
Ugh...
*Sniffle*
No crying, gentlemen. You played\nthe best you could, didn't you?
*Sniff*
That pain you feel should spur you on in thinking\nabout your soccer careers. But you'd do well not\nto dwell on it.
This German Junior Youth team\nhas fulfilled its duty today.
But... I have hopes that you'll all reunite,\neither in the youth league or in the pros.
Your future is wide open! Use this loss to\npush you forward, and don't ever give up!
Yes, Coach!





And now we're about to begin the closing ceremony\nfor the first Junior Youth World Challenge.
Our glorious first champion team, Japan, is\nentering the grounds to resounding cheers!
Looking back, they've had\nquite a struggle to make it this far.
In the early scrimmages, when they took hard\nlosses, most here didn't think much of them.
And then when the preliminaries started, they\nfaced a series of titans, forcing them into one\nfierce match after another.
The finals tournament was even more treacherous\nagainst the heroes of South America, Argentina,\nand from the European tradition, France.
And finally, today, they toppled the favorites to\nwin, Germany, and earned their championship crown!
And finally, today, they defeated\nthe paiz del futbol, Brazil, and\nearned their championship crown!
And finally, today, they defeated\nthe hometown heroes, America,\nand earned their championship crown!
But they didn't rise to the top just because\neach of their players worked hard.
No, it was because each and every one of them, on\nthe field and off, burned with a passion to be the\nbest, and they fought together as one!
The victory of the All-Japan Junior Youths is\nno less than a victory for teamwork itself!
Representing the winning team, Tsubasa Ozora\naccepts the victor's cup!
They've done it!\nFinally, after all this time, they're standing at\nthe top of the Junior Youth class!
And the MVP of the whole tournament was...
Japan's own guardian angel, Ken Wakashimazu!
M-Me...? The MVP?!
Awesome job, Wakashimazu!
Congrats!
From a guardian angel of Toho Academy to the\ntop keeper in the world in one stroke! Not bad!
This still doesn't feel real to me...
But this is thanks to all you guys, too!
The older of Japan's famous\ntwins, Masao Tachibana!
I'm the MVP?!
You did it, Masao! Grats!
Y-Yeah, thanks!
But I couldn't have done it without you,\nKazuo! Really, we're both the MVPs!
And not only that, Masao Tachibana\nwas also the top scorer!
I'm sure his countless quick and agile plays have\nbecome the obsession of young soccer fans the\nworld over!
Our heartfelt congratulations!
The younger of Japan's famous\ntwins, Kazuo Tachibana!
I'm the MVP?!
You did it, Kazuo! Grats!

Couldn't have done it without you though,\nMasao! It's like we're both the MVPs!
And not only that, Kazuo Tachibana\nwas also the top scorer!
I'm sure his countless quick and agile plays have\nbecome the obsession of young soccer fans the\nworld over!
Our sincerest congratulations!
The world's gutsiest player, Ryo Ishizaki!
Wh-Wh-Whaaa?! Me, the MVP?!
After embarrassing myself so much out there, you\nreally want to nominate me as the tournament's\nnumber one player?!
Congrats, Ishizaki!
Y-Yeah... Thanks, Tsubasa!
But this never would've happened if I hadn't met\nyou back in elementary. You practically gave me\nthis award yourself!
And equally impressive,\nIshizaki was also the top scorer!
His guts carried Japan through the championship!\nOur heartfelt congratulations!
Japan's living boulder, Hiroshi Jito!
Me...? I'm MVP?
Congratulations, Jito!
Yeah, thanks.
All these fellas chewed up and spat out the best\nin the world, and I'm the cream o' that crop?\nIt don't get any better than this!
And not only that, Jito was also the top scorer!
Japan's championship win could even be attributed\nto his fierce fighting spirit! Congratulations!
A man who was well-known as a defender as far\nback as elementary school, Shingo Takasugi!
Me...? The MVP?!
You did it, man!
Man, I'm speechless...
Haha! You think YOU'RE surprised?
Nice, Takasugi.
Jito...
I came all this way to fight some tough guys, but\nwho'd'a thought the strongest was runnin' right\nbeside me the whole time!
Grats, Takasugi! Lookin' good, bud!
Thank you, everyone!
Equally impressive, Takasugi\nwas also the top scorer!
You could even say he carried Japan to the\nchampionship! Our heartfelt congratulations!
Japan's Razor Fighter, Makoto Soda!
You're kidding me! I'm the MVP!?
Congratulations, Soda!
Yeah, thanks Takeshi!
It's all thanks to you telling me\nwhat's what before the tournament!
And not only that, Soda was also the top scorer!
Japan's championship win could even be attributed\nto his fierce fighting spirit! Congratulations!

I'm the MVP...? For real?!
Congrats, Izawa!
As someone who's been with you every step\nof the way! I'm so happy for you, man!

Thank you, everyone!
And not only that, Izawa was also the top scorer!
You could even say he was the force carrying\nJapan to the very top! Sincerest congratulations!
Once Japan's and now the world's\nFierce Tiger, Kojiro Hyuga!
I did it! I'm MVP!
Congratulations, Hyuga!
I always knew you'd do it, Hyuga!
Hey, thanks!
Hyuga?
Tsubasa?
Congrats, Hyuga. Nice to see my old\nrival get the recognition he's due.
I owe ya a lot, man. If you hadn't been my\nrival, I never would've made it this far.
Thanks, Tsubasa!
Hyuga was also the top scorer!
That's Japan's ace striker for you! No, the\nWORLD's ace striker now! Kojiro Hyuga!
Congratulations!
Straight out of Japan, the world's\nnumber one prodigy, Tsubasa Ozora!
I'm... I'm the MVP? Honestly?!
You earned it, Tsubasa!
Nice!
I knew this day would come.
That's our Tsubasa.
You really are something else, y'know!
As your rival, this kinda stings, but\nas your teammate, congratulations!
You did it, Tsubasa.
Awww, guys...
Thank you! I mean it!
And not only that, Tsubasa\nwas also the top scorer!
Tsubasa has certainly demonstrated to the\nworld why he is a hero to the next generation\nof players.
Our sincerest congratulations!
The Artist of the Field, Taro Misaki!
Really? I'm really the MVP?!
Let's hear it for Misaki!
Congrats! I'm sure everyone\nback in Furano is celebrating, too!
And doubtlessly at Meiwa Elementary, too!
Jeez, you guys...
Thank you!
(I'm so glad I worked up the\ncourage to come to America...)
Equally outstanding, Misaki\nwas also the top scorer!
The artistic shooting he developed\nin France has charmed the world!
Our most sincere congratulations!
The Wild Eagle of Hokkaido, Hikaru Matsuyama!
I'm the MVP?!
Congrats, Matsuyama! You're amazing!\nYour hard work really did pay off!
Misugi... Thank you.
I don't have the talent, so hard work was all\nI was left with. I guess it was all worth it...
But this is just the start. There's\nso much left to do for the future!
Matsuyama also managed the\nimpressive feat of being the top scorer!
His tenacity and strength, forged\nin the icy north, did much to carry\nJapan to the championship victory!
Congratulations!
The warrior who refuses to back\ndown from anyone, Hanji Urabe!
Me...? MVP?!
You did it, Capta-- I mean, Urabe!
Heh. We haven't always gotten along, but just\nfor today I'll let it slide. Congratulations.
You all...
Heh, thanks!
And not only that, Urabe was also the top scorer!
Japan's championship win could even be attributed\nto his fierce fighting spirit! Congratulations!
Japan's proud soccer prodigy, Jun Misugi!
I'm... the MVP?!
Congrats, Misugi!
I always knew you were a cut above!
Compared to your beautiful plays, it's\nlike we're knocked over turtles out there.
Grats, Misugi.
Thanks, you guys!
(Due to my heart condition,\nI can't play as much as I'd like.)
(But nothing has made me happier than being able\nto play on the world stage like this, surrounded\nby wonderful teammates.)
(I'm so glad I never gave up on soccer...)
And not only that, Misugi was also the top scorer!
Never letting the struggle with his health slow\nhim down, his extraordinary play carried Japan to\nthe top!
Sincerest congratulations from all of us!

Hyuga!

Nice, Nitta!
Thanks Cap-- I mean, Urabe!
I always knew you had talent,\nbut you've surprised even me!
Congrats, Nitta!
Tsubasa...
Thank you. I only made it this far thanks to you.
Huh? What do you mean?
When we lost in the Shizuoka regional finals, I\nswore to myself I'd reach your level one day.\nSurpass you.
I've worked so hard to make it, with\nyou always in my sights. So... thank you.
Oh...
So now I need to catch back up to you!
You can try!
And not only that, Nitta was also the top scorer!
His swift plays have rightfully earned\nhim the nickname Speed Star!
Deepest congratulations!
The real driving force behind\nthe scenes, Kazuki Sorimachi!
I'm the MVP?!
You did it, Sorimachi!
You're the pride of Toho Academy!
As another forward on the same team,\nit kinda stings, but... Grats Sorimachi!
You guys... thanks!
Sorimachi was also impressively the top scorer!
You could even say he carried Japan to the\nchampionship! Our heartfelt congratulations!
A man who's been called the Scoremonger\nsince elementary school, Teppei Kisugi!
I'm the MVP...?!
Congrats, Kisugi!
I can't believe the MVP of the\nwhole tournament is one of us!
As your partner in the Silver Duo,\nI am overwhelmed right now!
Thank you, everyone!
And not only that, Kisugi was also the top scorer!
He's certainly earned his nickname! Japan was\nfortunate to have him when the fighting got tough!
Sincerest congratulations!
Japan's hardest worker, Yuzo Morisaki!
I-I'm the MVP?!
Congrats, Morisaki!\nGuess all that practice paid off!
Wakabayashi!
To be honest, it's a little frustrating.\nI'm a goalie, too, after all.
Wakashimazu...
But now I have a goal to work towards!\nBe ready come high school, Morisaki!
Yeah, same to you!
The now internationally recognized\nguardian of the goal, Genzo Wakabayashi!
I'm the MVP!
Congrats, Wakabayashi!
Tsubasa?
Ever since elementary school, I always knew you\nwere the best keeper out there. And I was right!
Thanks.
But the fight continues.
Yeah, let's both keep it alive\nuntil we win that World Cup!
The man who burst onto the scene like a comet,\n<avatar_name>!
You did it, <avatar_name>!\nThey must be cheering back in Furano right now!
Congrats, <avatar_name>!\nYou're definitely a player to look out for!
Not bad, <avatar_name>!\nI knew you could do it!
Congrats on earning MVP. Even\nI was following your lead this time.
Let's aim for the World Cup together!
Yeah, let's both do our best!
For the World Cup!
Tak! There's still much to be achieved!
Tak! It'll take all our dedication\nto make that dream a reality.
And not only that, <avatar_name>\nwas also the top scorer!
He could easily be called the hero of\nthe Junior Youth World Challenge!
Our sincerest congratulations!
And as an award for scoring\ngoals, it's time to announce...
The top scorer!
Lets give a round of applause to the boys\nwho displayed such amazing heart and skill!
And our top scorer, the man who ignited the field\ntime and again, Germany's Young Emperor himself,\nKarl Heinz Schneider!
Top scorer, huh? Nice job, Schneider!
You did it, Schneider!
Yeah...
I'd think you'd be happier.
How can I be happy about this when we lost?
C'mon, don't say that.
If you scored more than anyone else, then you did\nnothing wrong. Your soccer really is number one.
Kaltz...
You're right. I'll try to look on the bright side.
The older of Japan's famous\ntwins, Masao Tachibana!
You did it, Masao! Grats!
Y-Yeah, thanks...
What's wrong?
I mean, yeah, I got a lot of goals, but... I was\nwondering if they got me mixed up with you, Kazuo.
I-I'm pretty sure they wouldn't do that...
Maybe not. Then, great!
That's the older brother I'm\nproud of! Once again, congrats!
The younger of Japan's famous\ntwins, Kazuo Tachibana!
You did it, Kazuo! Grats!
Y-Yeah, thanks...
What's wrong?
I mean, yeah, I got a lot of goals, but... I was\nwondering if they got mixed up with you, Masao.
C'mon, they wouldn't do that.
Maybe not. Then, great!
I'm proud of my little brother!\nOnce again, congrats!
The world's gutsiest player, Ryo Ishizaki!
After embarrassing myself out there like\nthat? I'm the top scorer? I can't believe it...
Way to be, Ishizaki!
Yeah, thanks Tsubasa!
Heh, wait'll I lug that top scorer trophy\nback home and tell mom all about it!
Japan's living boulder, Hiroshi Jito!
Congratulations, Jito!
Heh, "Top," huh? Sounds 'bout right.
Bein' good at both defense AND scoring\nshould make me some kinda soccer prodigy!
The dependable giant, Shingo Takasugi!
Not bad, Takasugi!
But I wasn't expecting that...
They called me the Scoremonger, but\nmaybe you should have that nickname...
Ha ha! Thanks, guys!
Japan's Razor Fighter, Makoto Soda!
Ha! Hear that? I cut through everything!
Maybe I should be aiming\nto be the Ace-Killer Striker!
Congratulations, Soda!
Yeah, thanks Takeshi!
It's all thanks to you telling me\nwhat's what before the tournament!
Japan's midfield master of\nthe header, Mamoru Izawa!
That's the power of Izawa!
That's Shutetsu's number 10 for you!
They call me the Scoremonger, but\neven I have to admit defeat here. Grats!
Thank you, everyone!
Once Japan's and now the world's\nFierce Tiger, Kojiro Hyuga!
Congratulations, Hyuga!
I always knew you'd do it, Hyuga!
Yeah, thanks!
(But this is just the first\nstep towards my dream.)
(I'll keep goin' 'til the day the number 9\non my back means "world's best striker"!)
Straight out of Japan, the world's\nnumber one prodigy, Tsubasa Ozora!
Congrats, Tsubasa!
Nice one!
Just what I'd expect from\nNankatsu SC's former centerfield!
You've got the magic touch\nwhen it comes to gettin' goals.
A real soccer prodigy!
As a forward, I wish it were me...
But as your teammate... Grats, Tsubasa.
Thanks, guys...
Thank you!
The Artist of the Field, Taro Misaki!
I'd expect no less from my rival.
Today, I'd like to earnestly\ncongratulate you, Misaki.
Alright, Misaki! As your partner on the\nfield, I couldn't be more overjoyed!
Thanks, Tsubasa.
But I couldn't have done it without all of you.
So let's just say we all were the top scorers!
The Wild Eagle of Hokkaido, Hikaru Matsuyama!
Congrats, Matsuyama.
Yeah, thanks Misugi!
Compared to the team winning the tournament,\ngetting top scorer is just the cherry on top,\nbut it still feels nice to be recognized!
Always thinking of the team, huh?
The warrior who refuses to back\ndown from anyone, Hanji Urabe!
Awesome job, Urabe!
Thanks, man!
Well, I got it this time, but\nit's yours next year, Nitta.
Urabe...
Yeah, for sure! I'll make it happen!
That's the spirit!
Japan's proud soccer prodigy, Jun Misugi!
Alright, Misugi!
Having seen what you can do\nfirst-hand... You earned this.
Dribbling, passing, shooting...\nIs there nothing you don't excel at?
Thanks, you guys!
(Due to my heart condition,\nI can't play as much as I'd like.)
(But nothing has made me happier than being\nable to play on the world stage like this,\nsurrounded by wonderful teammates.)
(I'm so glad I never gave up on soccer...)
Japan's tiny technician, Takeshi Sawada!
I'm the top scorer...!
Takeshi...
Hyuga!
I'm gonna be straight here...\nI'm so frustrated right now.
Still...
More than that, I'm happy for ya, Takeshi.\nYou've been a solid partner through and through.
Hyuga...
Grats, Takeshi! But I'm winning next time!
R-Right! Thank you!
Japan's acrobat, Mitsuru Sano!
Alright, Sano! That's my partner for ya!
Heh heh, thank you!
You did it, Sano!
Nitta!
To be honest, as another forward in\nthe same year, I'd hoped it'd be me...
But this means I've got a rival now!\nWhich is a nice secondary prize.
Let's see who's best next year!
Yeah, it'll be me!
Heh, now that's the bond of real men.
The dribbling master who surges\ndown the sidelines, Hajime Taki!
Way to go, Taki!
That's my partner for you! But as the\nScoremonger, I'm not falling behind!
We're proud of you, Taki!
Thank you, everyone!
Japan's proud sprinter, Shun Nitta!
Way to be fast, Nitta!
Urabe!
You're the man now, Nitta!
And Tsubasa, too! Thank you!
I owe you thanks as well, Tsubasa.
For what?
Nitta's come this far because he's been chasing\nyour heels since the Shizuoka regional finals.
Urabe...
Oh?
Then I have a rival to outperform next time, huh?
Tak! You know I'll be practicing every day!
The real driving force behind\nthe scenes, Kazuki Sorimachi!
You did it, Sorimachi!
From watching you play at Toho Academy,\nI knew you were good, but...
Sorimachi!
Hyuga!
As a teammate, well played.
But as your rival... I'm comin' for ya next time!
Hyuga...
Ha, same to you! This rivalry is gonna\nbe intense come high school!
A man who's been called the Scoremonger\nsince elementary school, Teppei Kisugi!
Ya see that, world?! Remember, Teppei Kisugi!
Congrats, Kisugi!
So Shutestu's Scoremonger is\nnow the world's Scoremonger!
I'll be counting on you, partner!
Thank you, guys!
The man who burst onto the scene like a comet,\n<avatar_name>!
Congratulations, <avatar_name>!\nNo doubt, they're cheering\nback in Furano right now!
Congrats, <avatar_name>!\nAlways had a good feeling about you!
So you're the top scorer, huh?
As a forward on the same team,\nwish it were me, but grats!
Congrats, <avatar_name>!\nI've got a lot to learn from you!
Let's aim for the World Cup together!
I'll lead Japan forward!
We'll definitely win it!
I'm not falling behind either!\nI'll see you on the pitch!
Yeah, no question! We can do it!
The absolute ace of Brazil, Carlos Bara!
Good work, Carlos!
...
Well with your skills... I'm not surprised!
You fought hard, Carlos. We let too\nmany points through on defense,\nmaking us responsible for how it ended.
We'll get ourselves to that next level,\nand be ready to win the next tournament!
Jeez, you're always so serious, Captain!
Next time we're winnin' for sure!
The beast of France, Louis Napoleon!
Heh heh, alright!
Way to conquer, Napoleon!
We couldn't win, but at least\nwe did ourselves a little proud.
What'd you expect with me on your team?
Well, I guess I need to give you credit\nfor about half of what went well, Pierre.
Am I hearing things?
My shots are only at their best\nwhen you send me those slick passes.\nNever could of done it without you.
Well aren't you a good sport all of\na sudden? What happened to you?
Shut up!
Anyway, I'm going to keep counting on you, Pierre.
Yeah, same here!
It appears Tsubasa will be giving a speech as a\nrepresentative of the victorious Japanese team.
...
Huh? A speech? But what do I say?
Don't overthink it. Speak from the heart.
Got it!
First off, I would like to thank everyone\nfor their loud, supportive voices.
We all worked incredibly hard\nto win this tournament.
And now that we have achieved\nthat dream, I'm overjoyed.
But I don't think this means we're\nabsolutely the best in the world, either.
One reason, I think this is that not every\ncountry participated in the preliminaries.
But more importantly, we all know that the\ntournament to clearly settle the world's best\nis called the World Cup!
Japan has participated in the World Cup\ncountless times, but we've never stood at the top.
But my real dream is to win the World Cup,\nand rise to the level of world's greatest.
Japan winning the World Cup...
Maybe it won't occur in my lifetime.\nMaybe it's destined to remain out of reach.
But, I choose to pursue it all the same.
The effort we put in to chase after our\ndreams is always a worthwhile endeavor.
Maybe it won't occur in my lifetime.\nMaybe it's all just fleeting.
But I...
I... We...
We'll always keep running after that dream!
After Tsubasa's inspiring speech, the\nAll-Japan Junior Youth is taking a victory lap!
Congrats, Roberto. I hate to\nadmit it, but you won our bet.
Uh, Roberto?
He was just here...
(Back then, I had no choice but to give\nup soccer, due to problems with my\nvision. Soccer was everything to me.)
(I was in such a state of shock and\ndespair that I'd lost my will to live.)
(But that's when I met you in Japan, Tsubasa.)
(I taught you how to play soccer,\nbut in return you taught me how\nwonderful it is to live for a dream.)
(And how joyful it is to teach soccer even when I\ncan't play. I only realized that thanks to you,\nTsubasa.)
(But despite that, I broke my promise\nto bring you to Brazil if you won Nationals.)
(Forgive me, Tsubasa.)
(Back then, I... I didn't have the confidence,\nthe courage, to follow through on that promise.)
(But now, I...)
(I...!)
Roberto.
Katagiri.
Please... Please, come with\nme and talk to Tsubasa.
I will.
Then please take this. It's an\nID card with your data on it.
I explained the situation to your team, and they\nwere able to file a formal application, so it\ncould be issued.
As long as you have it on you,\nyou will be permitted on the field.
So you arranged all this, Katagiri...?
I did.
Please... look after Tsubasa.
...Thank you.
The victory lap concluded, the\nplayers have returned to the bench.
Okay, let's head back to the dorm\nfor our victory celebration!
Woohoo!






Hmmm?
Wait, what?
...!
...
R-Roberto?
Yeah, it's me, Tsubasa.
I-It's Roberto...
Wh-What are you doing here?
Tsubasa...
Congratulations on your\nvictory. That was incredible.
Roberto...
Are... Are your eyes okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Roberto... I... I'm going to Brazil\nafter I graduate middle school!
I heard. I also saw the video you sent from Japan.
And today, I finally saw you\nplay with my own eyes.
From controlling the field to create scoring\nopportunities, to really bringing everyone\ntogether as captain... You were something else.
Watching you have the presence of mind to score,\nand pull your team together to hold the lead\nwas a pleasure.
You've grown so much, Tsubasa.
R-Roberto...
Would you allow me to help you\non the way to achieving your dream\nof being the best of the best?
Roberto!
Then... You'll teach me soccer again!
Of course.
I've always held out hope...
That if I kept playing soccer...
That if I did well enough...
I'd get to meet you again.
We're home!
No, we're not!
Oh, right! Oops. It just slipped out.
I know the feeling.
We've been here so long, and done so\nmuch... It really does feel a little like home.
But tomorrow, we're headed back to Japan.
Yeah, tomorrow's already the day...
After having so much fun together for so long,\nit'll be lonely when we have to go our separate\nways again.
But I know we'll see each other again,\nas long as we stay in the game.
Absolutely.
All the more reason to live\nit up at tonight's party!
Time to pig out!
We should try not to eat too much.
Don't forget we have to study.
You know it! I'm gonna eat and eat until I burst!
Someone's excited...
Haha! Don't worry, you're young!\nYou're still growing, so dig in!
Don't be such a wet blanket! We're young\nathletes-- We're in our eating prime!
I'm fairly certain, you won't get\ntaller just because you eat more...
Ya just gotta ruin everything.
You're still thinking of studying\nat a time like this?
I'm sure the school won't mind\nus taking one night off.
If you're really worried though, you\ncan always study on the flight home.
Then let's get this party started!
<avatar_name>... Matsuyama...\nCould we go talk somewhere... just us?
Um, okay.
I wonder what this is about.
Sorry for bothering you right before the party.
Actually, this is about\n<avatar_name>.
I was just contacted by a Brazilian soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
And that team happens to be\ncoached by Roberto Hongo.
Oh?
You mean, it's the team Tsubasa's joining?!
Exactly.
I was just contacted by Mr. Cardinal.
It seems you've been scouted\nfor an American soccer club.
Huh?
I was just contacted by a German soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
Huh?
I was just contacted by a Brazilian soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
Huh?
That's amazing! You're being\nscouted by other countries!
Anyway, I'd like to give a reply as soon\nas possible, but what do you think?
Please, tell them we're interested!
Can I talk to my family first?
Understood. I'll let them know.
Personally, I'd like to see you stay in school,\nbut this is your big chance. I'm rooting for you.
Of course, I'm sure your parents\nwill be a bit shocked.
You'll need to figure out if you're going it\nalone or if your family is coming, too, I bet.
Of course, the other party is aware of that,\ntoo, and they'll discuss it with your family.\nWe can save the details for later.
I'll let them know, though.
Again, sorry for bugging you\nright before the party, you two.
Go enjoy yourselves. I'll join you later.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
(Both Tsubasa and <avatar_name>\nwill lead us to the future of Japanese soccer!)
Hey, <avatar_name> and Misugi!\nCould we go talk somewhere else?
S-Sure.
What in the world could be going on?
Sorry for bothering you right before the party.
Actually, this is about\n<avatar_name>.
I was just contacted by a Brazilian soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
And that team happens to be\ncoached by Roberto Hongo.
Oh?
You mean he'll be on the same team as Tsubasa?!
Yes, exactly.
I was just contacted by Mr. Cardinal.
It seems you've been scouted\nfor an American soccer club.
Huh?
I was just contacted by a German soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
Huh?

Huh?
That's amazing! You're being\nscouted by other countries!
Anyway, I'd like to give a reply as soon\nas possible, but what do you think?
Please, tell them we're interested!
Can I talk to my family first?
Understood. I'll let them know.
I favor furthering this conversation, as well.\nThe sooner a talent like yours goes out into\nthe world to get experience, the better.
Yeah, it's best to start there, huh?\nYou definitely need your family's approval\nto study abroad, though, let alone overseas.
You also need to discuss if you'll be\nliving alone or if they'll come with you.
Of course, the other party is aware of that,\ntoo, and they'll discuss it with your family.\nWe can save the details for later.
I'll let them know, though.
Again, sorry for taking up your\ntime before the party, you two.
Go enjoy yourselves. I'll join you later.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
(Both Tsubasa and <avatar_name>\nwill lead us to the future of Japanese soccer!)
<avatar_name>, Hyuga...\nCould we go talk somewhere private?
Y-Yessir!
I wonder what this is about.
Sorry for bothering you right before the party.
Actually, this is about <avatar_name>...
I was just contacted by a Brazilian soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
And that team happens to be\ncoached by Roberto Hongo.
Huh?
The same team as Tsubasa?!
Exactly.
I was just contacted by Mr. Cardinal.
It seems you've been scouted\nfor an American soccer club.
Huh?
I was just contacted by a German soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
Huh?
I was just contacted by a Brazilian soccer club.
They want to scout <avatar_name>\nfor their team.
Oh?
That's amazing! Other countries have\ngot their eyes on you all of a sudden!
Anyway, I'd like to give a reply as soon\nas possible, but what do you think?
Please, tell them we're interested!
Can I talk to my family first?
Understood. I'll let them know.
I was kinda looking forward to me, you, and\nTakeshi fighting for the top spot on the\nteam next year, but this is your big chance.
I'll be cheerin' ya on, <avatar_name>.
Oh, right, your family'll worry about you\nif you just head off on your own...
Of course, the other party is aware of that,\ntoo, and they'll discuss it with your family.\nWe can save the details for later.
I'll let them know, though.
Again, sorry for taking your\ntime before the party, you two.
Go enjoy yourselves. I'll join you later.
Now if you'll excuse me.
(Both Tsubasa and <avatar_name>\nwill lead us to the future of Japanese soccer!)
(Sorry, Father. I couldn't become number one.)
(I couldn't prove you right to the world.)
(A call from... Father?)
Hello? Father?
I saw the match, Karl. Such close competition.
Yeah...
I'm sorry, I...
It's fine, Karl. You did your best, right?
You may have lost today, but you can still win\ntomorrow. You're young. You'll have other chances.
Right.
Plus...
You learn more from getting second\nplace, than you do from winning.
Huh?
Actually, I'll be coming to help\ncoach the same team you're on.
R-Really?! You're coming to Bayern?
That's right. I was invited by Coach Foerster.
Wow, really?
You've been working hard, Karl.\nI can't give up either, now can I?
So let's live together in Bayern.
Your Mom and Marie, too. Together, as a family.
F-Father...!
I'm sorry for everything... Really.
Thank you, Karl.
(Good for you, Schneider.)
Looks like Schneider's got\nnothing to worry about, then.
K-Kaltz?! Don't sneak up on me like that!
Ha ha ha!
Actually, you'd already noticed it\nabout Schneider, hadn't you Kaltz?
Of course. How long do you think I've known him?
Oh, right, you've been on the\nsame team since you were kids.
By the way, we're all headed back to\nGermany tomorrow, but what about you?
I'm staying in America. My leg injury is acting\nup again, so I'll need further treatment.
Yeah, repeating the same rehabilitation again\nis going to be such an absolute pain...
But what can ya do? You're the\none who chose to go for broke.
Yeah, I knew what it could cost.\nNow, I just gotta do this right.
But still, I need to get home. I've got my\nfan girls waiting for me in Dresden.\nI'd hate for them to miss me too much...
But by the time you get back, won't even they\nhave switched over to Schester already?
H-Hey! True or not, don't put\nstuff like that in my head, Kaltz!
Well, good luck mending yourself up.
And let's do this whole national team\nplayers thing together again, sometime.
Yeah, I'd be up for that.
The next day, the All-Japan Junior Youth team\narrived home with the greatest souvenir of all,\nthe first Junior Youth World Challenge trophy.
While they'd set off for their first inter-\nnational tournament in high spirits, they quickly\nran into a seemingly insurmountable hurdle.
With each match only deepening their sense of\ninadequacy, they found themselves distraught.
But from the depths of their despair, they rose\nto the occasion and overcame their weaknesses.\nTogether, they became a real team.
And just like that, they leapt the barrier\nthat had blocked their path, and were\ncrowned the world's greatest.
But for these boys, this was just the beginning.
There remained the dream of\na World Cup victory for Japan.
And, by pledging their futures to the pursuit of\nthis grand dream, they continue to press forward.
Diego Barbas, Argentina Junior Youth Coach
So you came all the way out to America,\nas well, Roberto? It's been a while.
It has, Coach Barbas.\nToday's match should be interesting.
Look, I know you've got some\nJapanese blood in you, but sorry to say,\nthere's only one way this will go.
Well, you're certainly confident.\nSo what you mean to say is there's no way\nthey can lose if they have Diaz?
Pretty much.
I wouldn't be too quick to underestimate\nTsubasa Ozora, if I were you.
Tsubasa? You mean Japan's number 10?
Yeah, I taught him. He only seems like\nthe underdog if you don't know him.
He's just as much of a soccer prodigy as Diaz.
Japan might lose, but I think we're\nin for a great match either way.
You don't say...
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Well, suit yourself.
Who was that you were talking to, Coach?
Roberto Hongo. A former player for Brazil,\nand a good buddy of mine.
He's part Japanese too, and he told me to keep\nan eye on a kid he worked with, Japan's number 10.
Japan's number 10... Oh, right,\nthere was that guy who's got a\nSouth American vibe. Must've been him.
Whoops, we better hurry down to the stadium.
Okay, everybody listen up.
Today, we're in the finals,\nwhich means our opponents are going to be\ngiving this everything they've got.
Of course, we can do no less.\nKeep the fighting spirit alive!
Yessir!
Alright. Time to start the meeting.
First, we're up against Argentina.\nTo put it bluntly, you can just think\nof them as Juan Diaz's team.
He dominates the midfield\nand sets up passes for his teammates,\nbut he can move in and score, as well.
The other players basically do whatever\nthey can to support his play.
So if we put the pressure on Diaz,\nthen we're putting the pressure on Argentina.\nEasier said than done, of course.
You need to especially look out for\nhis dribbling and his acrobatics.
Even if we mark him with multiple players, it\nmight not be enough to stop him. He's that good.
He's their team's absolute ace, so we need\nto fight back with an ace of our own.
Tsubasa.
Yes?
If you can hold the midfield and pin Diaz down,\nwe'll be cutting their power in half or more.
I'm looking to you to make it happen out there.
Yessir!
Misaki! Tsubasa's going to need your support.
Yessir!
(Using Roberto's notes, I've been absorbing\nthe techniques and philosophies of\nSouth American soccer for three years now.)
(And today I'm up against Juan Diaz, the man\nrenowned as South America's strongest midfielder.)
(Will my tricks work against the real thing?)
Listen up!\nToday's the start of the finals tournament.\nFrom here on out, everything is on the line.
Our opponent is Japan, who took down Italy and\nthe Netherlands in the prelims. They may be the\nteam with the most momentum right now.
But don't let it get to you. We'll play this just\nlike always, with Diaz holding midfield while the\nrest of you support him. No problem.
Well, we tied with our old rival Brazil in the\nlast match of the prelims, and with our win rate\nthat puts us at second place overall.
Well, we tied with our old rival Brazil in the\nlast match of the prelims, and with our win rate\nthat puts us at second place overall.
We've arrived at the true mountain of this\ntournament. Everything has been to assure\nour ascent to victory.
And that's why we must keep advancing to the\nfinals, beat Brazil once and for all, and come\nout on top!
Yes, Coach!
How are you feeling, Diaz?
After resting last match, better than ever!
I just want to get out there!\nI'm ready to give it 110%!
That's our Diaz!
Leave it to me!
Let's show these spoiled Japanese kiddies\nthe teamwork we learned in the streets!
Alright!
With me and Pascal here, we're invincible!
It's finally here! The finals tournament of the\nJunior Youth World Challenge are about the begin!
And our first match is Japan versus Argentina!
You'll remember Argentina's MVP from the\npreliminaries, the Treasure of Argentina himself,\nJuan Diaz!
Blessed with both speed and technique,\nhis dribbling and acrobatics\nare the marks of an unmatched talent!
If Japan wants to win here, it'll all\ncome down to how they handle this\nonce-in-a-decade prodigy!
And of course the only man for the job\nis Japan's very own prodigy, Tsubasa Ozora!
Two young soccer stars squaring off\nas both captains and midfielders!\nGet ready for the clash of the decade!
Hey! You! Number 10!
You learned South American technique from\nRoberto Hongo, right? Show me something out there.
Wh-What?
You know Roberto?! Where did you...?
Well, uh...
Our coach is friends with him.\nThey were chatting before the match.
He... He's here?
Yeah. He's up in the stands.
He's watching right now?!
Focus, man. The match is already starting.
What's up, Tsubasa?
It's Roberto...\nDiaz said he's in the stands right now.
Really?
But where? I can't spot him...
C'mon, get your head in the game!\nWe're in a match!
I think that ball belongs to me, \nnumber 10!
Whoa, not bad!
Ugh, so this is Juan Diaz?
Hmph, is that all?
I won't lose!
Not half bad, number 10!
Is that all, number 10?
Diaz got beat?!
Okay, now don't let me down\nguys!
You face the mighty Juan Diaz!
(Roberto's watching this!)
(I need to get control of the\ngame!)
(Tsubasa's off his game\nthinking about Roberto.)
(But that's why I'm here!)
I guess Japan's nothing special after all.
Looks like not even Brazilian coaching\ncan polish a stone into a gem.
Get on our level, kiddie!
...
What?!
(What am I doing?)
(I'm not playing for Roberto, am I?)
(I'm playing for myself. For my team.)
Tsubasa...
A three point spread... We should give you guys\na handicap so you can keep up.
Wh-What'd you say?!
You heard me.
Tsu-Tsubasa...
I need to get those three points back...
Yeah, the ball already went in,\nso there's nothing else to do.
Let's turn this around!
Never surrender!
C-Can we really do it?
Even if they were up by five we'd be fine!
Yeah, there's still time!
This ain't about whether we can or not!\nWe're getting it done!
Tak! The fight's about giving as good as you get!
What are you...?
Hey, I think we broke Diaz.
I mean, if you ask me, this is more fun, anyway!
We're in this all the way!
That's just what it means to aim for number one!
Here we go, guys!
Tak!
We can worry about Roberto together\nafter the game, alright?
Thanks, Misaki.
Here we go, Pascal!
You'll never stop us!
We're more than able! C'mon,\nPascal!
Yeah, get ready to see a real\nduo work!
Here we go, Misaki!
Yeah, I'm with you all the\nway!
Let's get 'em, Misaki!
You got it, Tsubasa!
Hey, Tsubasa.
Misaki...
We can worry about Roberto later, together,\nso focus on the game, alright?
(He's right. What's wrong with me?)
(I play soccer for myself, for my team.)
(Watch me soar, Roberto!)
(That stupid number 10 thinks he stands a chance\nagainst the great Juan Diaz?)
(It's time I showed him\nwhat real skill looks like!)
Diaz.
We're taking that point right back,\ngot that Pascal?!
Uh... Sure.
(Hmph. I let them get the first point.\nGuess I got a little careless.)
Diaz.
It's go time, Pascal!\nWe're taking that point right back!
On it!
Diaz just put the momentum of a cartwheel\nand a backflip right into an overhead kick!
What incredible acrobatics!
Wow, that Diaz guy is nuts.
What're you talking about, Masao?
Yeah, we got our own tricks.
That's for sure.
Alright! Guess it's time to show off our new move!
Heck yeah!
This is what we've been waiting for!\nThe Tachibana Brothers and Jito's aerial soccer!\nTheir Skylab Twin Shot!
To think we'd never see it if\nthey hadn't come together to represent Japan!\nThe ultimate aerial technique!
Whoa... What was that?
The acrobatics are cool and all,\nbut check out that leg strength!
Interesting. I never thought of that approach.\nI guess there's more than one way to cook an egg.
Awesome! You three must've really been\nworking on that since we reached the US!
Well, the shot itself was ready a while ago.
It's the landing that was tough.\nThat part took some time to get right.
Yeah, not gettin' hurt's important.\nWe got it sorted, though.
We make a great team, Jito!
For sure, Kazuo!
Hey, I'm Kazuo! Don't mix us up!
So those are number 10's\nbuddies, huh?
I won't drag Diaz down!
Here we go, Diaz!
See that?! Pure Argentinian gold!
Nice job, Diaz!
Couldn't have done it without you!\nLet's keep it up!
No way! I lost? Me?!
Hmph, not half bad!
Not even worth my time!
And that's halftime!
It's the first match of the finals tournament,\nJapan vs. Argentina,\nand Japan leaves the field in the lead!
And that's halftime!
It's the first match of the finals tournament,\nJapan battling Argentina, and the teams are tied!
And that's halftime!
It's the first match of the finals tournament,\nJapan battling Argentina,\nand Japan's had a rough first half.
Phew...
You tired, Diaz?
Heh, maybe I overdid it a little.
I doubt I can keep this up next half,\nso let's go back to our usual pace, alright?
Sure thing. We've still got a long way to the\nfinals, so we definitely need to pace ourselves.
Exactly.
Wow, that Diaz guy is nuts.
What're you talking about, Masao?
Yeah, we got our own tricks.
You bet.
Alright! Guess it's time to show off our new move!
Right on!
Wow, that Diaz guy is nuts.
What're you talking about, Masao?
Yeah, we got our own tricks.
You bet.
Alright! Let's show off our new move\nnext time we get a chance!
Right on!
Hey, can I ask you something?
Hmmm?
Shouldn't we try using\nthat new move in the next half?
I was thinking the exact same thing.
Great minds think alike!
Wouldn't wanna let all that hard work go ta waste.
Then it's time to break out the big guns.
Right on!
Funny how you think the same. Twins're weird.
Hmmm...
What's wrong, Masao?
I was just thinking we never got a chance\nto show off that new move we practiced.
True that. And we're the only guys that can.
Be patient. We'll get our chance.
Patience is not one o' my virtues. But fine.
Yeah, complaining won't do anyone any good.
But let's make sure we're ready\nwhen the time comes.
Right on!
Great first half, guys.
Just stay focused and victory is yours.
Yes, Coach!
Tsubasa, you comfortable against Diaz out there?
I'm managing. But I'm afraid to even blink.
Don't worry, We'll be right behind you.\nJust keep doing what you do.
Okay! Counting on you guys!
So how's the war with Diaz going?
He's good. This must be what a real\nSouth American midfielder is like.
(I guess my style doesn't cut it\nagainst the genuine article.)
Well, either way you need\nto keep fighting next half.
Huh?
Me and the others are right behind you.\nSo just keep cracking away at him!
Misaki...
(Right! I have my team supporting me!)
You got it!
Too bad you never got a chance\nto go head to head with Diaz.
Just how the game goes.\nBut I'm sure it'll happen in the next half.
Yup. And when it does, I'll be right behind you.\nSo do what you do best.
I will. Thanks, Misaki.
Keep marking Diaz in the second half, Tsubasa.\nDon't let him set the pace.
That's the plan.
Be confident. He's no more talented than you are.
Thanks, Misugi.
(Ever since we got to America, every team\nwe've faced has had memorable players.)
(And only by outplaying them can I hope\nto become the world's best soccer player.)
Let's do this guys!\nThe second half is waiting for us!
Right on!
What're you guys doing out there?\nDiaz can't be everywhere at once, you know!
You're all responsible for the pride of Argentina\njust as much as he is!\nHave some confidence in your own skill!
Y-Yes, Coach!
It's not your fault, guys.
Diaz.
I'm the one who's responsible.\nThat's what it means to be captain.
But...
Plus, it looks like I should've paid more\nattention to Roberto Hongo's words of warning.
After seeing him up close, I get it. We weren't\nprepared for what that number 10 can really do.
Sorry, Diaz.
They call us the Argentinian Golden Duo,\nbut I can't keep up with you at top speed.
Don't worry about it, Pascal.
I mean, they say I'm a generation-defining\nprodigy, right? I need to live up to that.
It's weirder that number 10 guy CAN keep up.
But Diaz...
Relax, guys. It's fine.
As long as you've got the great Juan Diaz on\nyour side, there's no way Argentina can lose!\nStrap in and enjoy the ride!
Diaz!
(For better or worse, this is a one-man team.\nIt's Diaz or nothing.)
(I'm counting on your energy to turn this around\nfor them next half, Diaz.)
The first half may be over,\nbut you can still turn it around guys.
You made it this far, so I know\nyou can still win. Don't get frustrated,\nand keep the fight alive.
Yes, Coach!
Tsubasa, you comfortable against Diaz out there?
I'm managing. But I'm afraid to even blink.
Don't worry, I'll be right behind you.\nJust keep doing what you do.
Okay! Counting on you!
So how's the war with Diaz going?
He's good. It's like, so this is what\na real South American midfielder is like.
(I guess my style doesn't cut it\nagainst the genuine article.)
Well, either way you need\nto keep fighting next half.
Huh?
Me and the others are right behind you.\nSo just keep cracking away at him!
Misaki...
(Right! I have my team supporting me!)
You got it!
Too bad you never got a chance\nto go head to head with Diaz.
Just how the game goes.\nBut I'm sure it'll happen in the next half.
Yup. And when it does, I'll be right behind you.\nSo do what you do best.
I will. Thanks, Misaki.
Tsubasa, overall I think control of this match\nis going to come down to the midfield.
Mark Diaz even tighter than you did\nthe first half. You set the pace.
I will.
Be confident. He's no more talented than you are.
Tak! I've got this!
(Ever since we got to America, it's been one\nclose game against a strong rival after another.\nBut we've made it this far.)
(And that's how I know I'll beat Diaz\nand win this.)
(If I can't manage that, then I'm definitely way\noff being the best player in the world!)
Let's do this guys!\nThe second half is waiting for us!
Right on!
You guys did great in the first half.\nJust keep it up and you'll be fine.
Yessir!
So Diaz, how was that number 10?
What's there to say? I'm just better.
It's just that...
Hmmm?
I just feel like there's more to him.\nLike we haven't seen what he can really do.
If Roberto was right, then maybe he'll\nonly show his stuff once he's been cornered.
I'm sure you'll be fine, Diaz,\nbut don't get careless.
Leave it to me!
Sorry, Diaz.
They call us the Argentinian Golden Duo,\nbut I can't keep up with you at top speed.
Don't worry about it, Pascal.
I mean, they say I'm a generation-defining\nprodigy, right? I need to live up to that.
It's weirder that number 10 guy CAN keep up.
But Diaz...
But don't worry, guys. You've got\nthe great Juan Diaz on your side!
There's no way Argentina can lose this!\nJust strap in and enjoy the ride!
Diaz!
(For better or worse, this is a one-man team.\nIt all comes down to Diaz.)
(I'm counting on your energy to push\nthis team to the limit, Diaz.)
Halftime is over, and both team's players\nare scattered across the pitch!
(My Japanese rivals are my teammates now.)
(And we all came together to America\nto face the strongest opponents there are.)
(One of the best is the Argentinian prodigy,\nJuan Diaz.)
(This is it, Diaz.)
(In order to beat you... And to win the match...\nI'll use my brand new technique!)
(After that first half, I think I get you,\nnumber 10.)
(Maybe you're another prodigy like me.\nI don't know.)
(But the world doesn't need two of us.\nI'm more than enough.)
(I'm the one they'll talk about\nas the best in the world.)
(In order to beat you... And to win the match...\nI'll show you everything I've got!)
(My new sure-killing shot!)
Halftime is over, and the second half\nis about to get underway.
Will Japan hold onto their lead,\nor will Argentina turn the game around?
The duel between Tsubasa and Diaz is set\nto determine the outcome of the match!
Halftime is over, and the second half\nis about to get underway.
Which of these teams will finally\nbreak out into the lead?
The key to everything will be the duel\nbetween the two aces, Tsubasa and Diaz!
Halftime is over, and the second half\nis about to get underway.
Japan's lost the lead,\nand they'll be looking to close the gap early.
Can Japan's Tsubasa put the pressure on\nArgentina's Diaz and win his team the game?!
Our showdown isn't over, Diaz!
It was just getting\ninteresting!
Time to play my trump card!
I-I'm speechless! It appeared as though\nDiaz was going for his usual overhead kick...
But it's as if the ball suddenly leapt into the\ngoal after cutting a swath through the turf!
Heh, see that? THAT'S what makes a prodigy!
Never doubted you, Diaz!
(That shot just now reminds me of Tsubasa's\nat Nationals, but there's something else to it.)
(Having seen them both up close, I can tell.)
(Diaz put speed and rotation on the ball\nin a way that it'd pitch past everyone!\nHe read our movements!)
(That shot just now is like the one I used back\nat Nationals, but it was way more sophisticated.)
(Back then I got the ball to leap\nin the opposite direction...)
(But Diaz is adjusting the speed and spin\nso the ball will leap up around everyone!)
(Getting the right speed and spin with\nan overhead would be nearly impossible,\nlet alone controlling the direction! What skill!)
(My Drive Shot just wasn't powerful\nenough to take on the globe.)
(But everyone else has lent me strength.\nI'm a better player than ever!)
Here we go, Argentina!\nGet a load of my new Drive Shot!
S-Simply amazing! A stellar shot from Tsubasa!
That was completely different from\nhis old Drive Shot! What force! What height!
We've just witnessed a phoenix reborn here\nin the skies above the Star Crown Stadium!\nAnd it dove straight into the Argentinian goal!
High five, Tsubasa!
I always knew you were something else, you maniac!
Thanks guys!
You did it!
Thanks to you, Hyuga!\nTraining with that black ball gave me an edge!
I've been kicking my Drive Shots from a stance\nthat makes it easier to put spin on it.
But that keeps me from\nreally putting heat on the ball.
So that's what you realized\nthat night we were practicing?
Yup.
I knew then if I used a stance where I could\nget my full power behind it, my Drive Shot\nwould become a new kind of beast.
And it all just came together, now.
That's our Tsubasa!
The game's not over yet.
That's not it at all.
If it weren't for you and\nMisaki and Ishizaki encouraging me...
I'd never have figured this out,\nand I'd never have perfected this shot.
Yeah, you're right. We need to stay focused.
Alright guys, it's not over until it's over!\nLet's set the field on fire!
Right on!
(Even though I'm here... We're still losing...)
Diaz.
Pascal...
Calm down.
It's not just you out there, you know.
Yeah, I pass to you because I TRUST you.
We believe in you, Diaz!
Team...
(Yeah, there's no need to panic.\nEveryone's got my back.)
Tak! I've got this!
Let's go get 'em!
You put your trust in me, and Juan Diaz\nisn't a man who lets his teammates down!
You see that, guys?
Nice shot! You're still the greatest!
Juan Diaz, superstar!
The Argentinians are positively roaring with joy,\nas they gather around Diaz!
And there's the whistle!
That's game! Japan soundly defeats the\nSouth American titan Argentina and moves on!
And there's the whistle!
Throughout both halves, neither Japan\nnor Argentina could clinch the lead!
Overtime will decide\nwho makes it to the semifinals!
And there's the whistle!
Japan falls to the South American titan,\nArgentina!
Tsubasa fought well, but he just couldn't cut it\nagainst the South American prodigy, Diaz!
You all played well the whole game.
I'm sure you're exhausted, but they are too.\nJust hang in there, and your time will come!
Yessir!
Okay, everyone listen up.
What is it, Matsuyama?
From what we've seen so far, Tsubasa isn't free\nto make his plays while Diaz is marking him.
So we need to get him off Tsubasa's back.\nAnd to do that, I want you to get me the ball.\nDiaz will be sure to come after me.
Huh? But why would he do that?
Because aside from Tsubasa, he thinks of\nall of us as beneath him. So if I have the ball,\nhe'll see it as an easy chance to steal.
Then if I can beat out Diaz, Tsubasa will\nbe in the clear, ready to take a pass.
D-Did you just skim over the part\nwhere you have to beat Diaz?
Yeah, that's too risky! We'll be in real trouble\nif he gets the ball from you!
No surprise you're worried. But you know how good\nI am, don't you <avatar_name>?
I think I might know better than anyone.
The fight you gave me back at Nationals\nis still burned into my muscles.
Thanks, Tsubasa.
Okay, got it. It's up to you now, Matsuyama.
We'll be fine!\nThis is Matsuyama we're talkin' about!
And even if he loses the ball,\nit's not like we'd leave him swingin' in the wind!
You'd better not.
Don't underestimate the captain.
Can you really beat Diaz?
W-We're not! It's just, you know, what if?
I mean, it's no surprise you're worried.
But I'm pretty confident in my one-on-one skills.
I don't care who I'm up against, I'll win!
It's a little worrying when the guy\nwho's seen me play the most asks that...
But just watch me.\nI wouldn't be saying this if I weren't confident.
I'll get it done.
Okay, got it. It's up to you now, Matsuyama.
We'll be fine!\nThis is Matsuyama we're talkin' about!
And even if he loses the ball,\nit's not like we'd leave him swingin' in the wind!
You'd better not.
(It's hard to get anything done with\nDiaz marking me. Even working with Misaki.)
(If I could pass to someone else and get Diaz\nto give chase, I could slip his mark...)
(But who could take Diaz one on one?\nWho even has the confidence to try?)
You've gotta be kidding me!\nJust how tenacious are these guys?
This Japan isn't just some mediocre Asian team.
We're up against the Japan that's aiming\nfor the championship... Same as we are.
Never forget that. We need to match their wills\nwith our own. Everything goes into this overtime!
Y-Yeah!
I hear ya, Diaz.
The first match of the finals tournament,\nJapan and Argentina, is moving into overtime!
If they happen to get through overtime with\nno one taking the lead, this'll be settled with\na shootout. But will it get that far?
I guess we're about to find out, as the teams\nretake the field and wait for the whistle!
Let's make it happen, guys!
We're going to the top four!
Not if we can help it!
I-Impossible!
None of you, except number 10,\nis a match for me!
You may be some sort of\nsoccer genius, but...
I'm the one who stood\ntoe-to-toe with Tsubasa!
And no one's got a harder head \nthan I do!
It's up to you now, Tsubasa!
GOOOAL! A masterful play from Japan!
Tsubasa left the ball to Matsuyama, slipping\nDiaz's mark! What a winning strategy!
Matsuyama's strength in a one-on-one\nis its own marvel!
And that's the first half of overtime!
Japan managed to make their attempts on\ngoal count and came out with the lead!
And that's the first half of overtime!
Neither team has come out ahead!\nHow will this battle end?!
And that's the first half of overtime!
It hurts just to say it, but Japan has fallen\nbehind! Still, time remains! Don't give up!
Diaz really is incredible...
We just don't have enough time.
You're right, Diaz IS incredible.
But I am too. And so is every last one of us.\nWe've invested too much to just give up now.
First we close the gap. And then we take the lead!
Tsubasa...
He's right. There's still time.\nIt's not over until the final whistle!
You said it, Misaki.
Maybe the other guys think they've already\nwon this, but we're no quitters!
You said it, Hyuga.
We've still got another half of overtime to go,\nso game faces on!
Let’s do this!
Ishizaki.
Hmmm?
You guys... Nankatsu didn't lose\nfor three years straight, right?
What're you...?
Nah, it's nothing.
(It's just that I'm finally feeling\nwhat it's like to be on his team.)
(It's like no matter what we're up against,\nno matter how badly we're losing,\nwe'll get through it. As long as he's here.)
(Like we can win this,\nas long as we don't hold back.)
(That's the power of the number 10.)
...
Diaz...
Only one overtime half left, huh?
But it's not over until it's over.
Diaz!
Tak! If we're gonna be champions,\nit's no time to be quitting.
I'll take care of defense!\nYou all hit 'em where it hurts!
Pascal, we're in this together to the end.
Alright! Let's win this!
Tightening up the defense, guys!
The other side will be fighting desperately\nto score in the remaining time!\nWe just need to keep 'em out!
Zróbmy to!
The clock is quickly winding down\nin this battle of the ages!
Which of these teams will seize victory?!
You won't want to blink once the whistle blows!
I'm the king of the world!
You know me! I am Juan Diaz, \nthe prodigy!
Aaand there's the whistle!
After a desperate struggle all the way\nthrough overtime, Japan beats Argentina\nand moves on to the semifinals!
Aaand there's the whistle!
Even after both teams pulled out all the stops,\nit's still not over!
The semifinals seat will be settled by a shootout!
Aaand there's the whistle!
Not even Japan's tenacity was enough\nto put them over the top in the end!
It's really been a great showing from both teams!
Okay, all that's left is the penalty shootout!\nWhether shooting or defending,\nyou cannot hesitate! You can do this!
Yessir!
I know you're tired, but this is all\nthat's between us and the semifinals!
Zróbmy to!
Sorry guys. Even with me on the field,\nwe couldn't win.
Don't get all soft on us now, Diaz.\nIt ain't over yet!
I'll stop their shots like my life depends on it!\nYou just worry about getting the ball\npast their goalie!
Leave it to me! I'm not Diaz,\nbut I still got a mean kick.
I don't know what to say...
This is it, Diaz!\nOur legs'll get us to those semifinals!
Yeah, let's do this!
They did it! Japan did it!\nThey've defeated Argentina in the shootout!\nThey're going to semifinals!
Japan came so close! So very very close!\nThey were just one step behind Argentina!
After losing the shootout,\nthe semifinals are now beyond their reach.
We won! We really won!
We're in the semifinals!
Let's go all the way!
We won, Tsubasa!
We did it, guys!
Japan appears overjoyed\nas they gather around their captain!
You guys are the best.
(That's right.)
(When we work together,\nthe J Boys' Soccer can take on the world!)
We did it!
(I lost... Me... Juan Diaz.)
Diaz...
It's a tough loss.
Yeah...
(The legend of Juan Diaz, the man destined\nto become the best in the world,\nhas already been marred, in chapter one.)
(And Japan's number 10 is the man responsible.)
Hey! Number 10!
Diaz?
Your name. Tell me your name.
Tsubasa. Tsubasa Ozora.
Tsubasa, huh?
Yeah.
I'll remember it.
And you, number 12. What's your name?
Hikaru Matsuyama.
Hikaru. I'll never forget\nyour stubbornness, either.
I hope we get to play again someday, Diaz.
Well, good luck, Tsubasa!\nYou've still got two fights ahead of you!
Thanks!
(For now, I must accept my loss.)
(But I'll be back to take you down someday.\nI hope you're ready when the time comes, Tsubasa!)
Never thought I'd lose to YOU, one-on-one.
Must've let my guard down\nbecause I knew your face.
And you too. You've sure got talent,\ngoing head to head with yours truly like that.
But I won't lose next time!\nI'll take you and Tsubasa together!
Well, good luck, Tsubasa!\nYou've still got two fights ahead of you!
Thanks!
(For now, I must accept my loss.)
(But I'll be back to take you down someday.\nI hope you're ready when the time comes, Tsubasa!)
You've got the best dribble I've seen,\nbesides Diaz's.
Don't let that talent go to waste.
Your dribble's not half bad. Although, you've\nstill got a long way to go to keep up with Diaz.
Looks like you got a nice dribble.
Well, good luck, Tsubasa!\nYou've still got two fights ahead of you!
Thanks!
(For now, I must accept my loss.)
(But I'll be back to take you down someday.\nI hope you're ready when the time comes, Tsubasa!)
(You've grown so much, Tsubasa.)
(Both as a captain, and as a playmaker,\nyou bring out the best in your teammates.\nAnd it's your spirit that leads the way.)
(When I left you that notebook,\nI wrote "be a midfielder.")
(And you've stuck to that, becoming a wonderful\nmidfielder better than I could've dreamed.)
(And that Drive Shot you put on display today...\nThat's miles ahead of the one I showed you.\nYou made it yours.)
(Even without me, you're bound for great things.)
Roberto.
Katagiri...
(We won this match, but there's still work to do.)
(If I was simply satisfied,\nI'd never have the hunger to become the best.\nI bet Roberto would agree.)
(To think... He was watching me\nfrom somewhere in this stadium...)
Hey, Tsubasa.
Yo, Misaki.
So... Is Roberto really here?
Yeah, Diaz said he met him before the game,\nso he must be somewhere around here.
Maybe we could ask Mr. Katagiri?
It sounds like he's been talking\nto a lot of people involved\nwith American soccer about team stuff.
Maybe he's heard something about Roberto?
You're brilliant! Thanks, Misaki!
He'll definitely be in the dorms tonight,\nso try asking him then.
I will!
I can't believe we're already in semis.\nIt still doesn't feel real.\nDoesn't that mean we're, like, awesome?
Sure does. We're in the top four, at worst!\nAnd if we win today we'll be in the finals!
But doesn't it feel like we should have more, um,\nfemale fans by now? I was hoping the people\ncheering for us would be up an octave.
Yeah, like that. Wait, who're they cheering for?
Th-That's a lotta girls.
Guess that means the French team has arrived.
They're probably all fans of Pierre.
All of them?!
I mean, it's like that everywhere\nyou go in France. Looks like even in America,\nhe's got the fanbase.
So he's the French Misugi then.
When you've got it. You've got it.
Now's our chance, Ishizaki!
Oh right, there was that Misugi Fanclub\nback in elementary school.\nDid they keep that up even into middle school?
Um, well, er...
Reminds me of Schester back in Germany.
Gotta admit, I'm a wee bit jealous.
Oh, you're right! Let's go say hi to them!
Knock it off you two.\nThe match is about the start!
C'mon, it was just a joke!
Glad to see you made it this far, Misaki.
Hello, Pierre.
So we can settle this at the tournament,\njust like we promised.
Yeah. Looking forward to it.
Good luck. Have fun.
Yeah, let's both bring everything we've got.
So you're the Japanese captain?\nMay the best man win.
Wouldn't have it any other way!
H-Hey, looks like that fanclub's stampeding\nright towards us!
Whoops, it seems I'm needed elsewhere. Au revoir!
This game's probably going to come down to\na showdown in the midfield with Pierre.
Absolutely. And I can't wait.
Listen up guys, it's finally the semifinals.
We're up against France, and you know they had\nthe tournament venue stolen from them.\nThe grudge they harbor has made them even tougher.
Especially their captain, Pierre.\nHe has no weaknesses, either on\noffense or defense. A perfect all-rounder.
As the captain, he's also led his team this far.
But besides Pierre, there's another player you\nneed to watch out for. Their forward, Napoleon.
He can give his shots an incredible amount\nof spin without sacrificing any power. Most\nof the team's points have been his doing.
To be frank, these two are at a level where\nthey can completely shut out any of the aces\nwe've faced so far.
But while this won't be easy, as long as\nwe can keep those two from having shots on goal,\nvictory is in reach.
Whatever you do,\ndon't let them get downfield unmarked.
Yes, Coach!
Lastly, there's one other guy you need\nto keep an eye on. Jean, on defense.
He was brought in just for this tournament, and\nhe's stopped countless offenses with his ability\nto dart around quickly and read the field.
He singlehandedly props up\ntheir otherwise weak defensive line.
But since this also frees up Pierre\nto focus on scoring,\nhe also represents a huge boost to their offense.
Pierre sets up the play, Napoleon scores,\nand Jean shuts down the counter.
It's a simple strategy, but that just\nmakes it all the more reliable.\nTheir results so far are proof of that.
But you guys are amazing, too.\nSo much so that you surpass everything I'd\never imagined when we first arrived in America.
You've been beating teams with indelible\nreputations left and right.\nYour results are nothing to scoff at, either.
First this game, and then we get a crack\nat being number one in the world.
Believe in yourselves,\nand show me that winning spirit!
Yes, Sir!
Hey guys, can I ask you a favor?
Sure, what is it?
Could you leave Pierre to me? I'll mark him.
Never thought I'd hear something\nlike that from you, Misaki.
I've told you about this before,\nbut back in France he and I played man-to-man\nand came out even.
After that, we promised that we'd settle\nthe score in this tournament. I'm sure Pierre\nwill have an eye out for me, as well.
Maybe this is just me being selfish,\nbut I need to do this.
Well, you're right... It is kinda selfish.
Nothing wrong with being a little selfish.
Nothing's more important than a man's honor!
But you know, this might be the first time\nI think I've heard you really ask for a favor.
I can tell it means a lot to you.
Yeah.
Then sure, why not? I'll be rooting for you!
Yeah. And coming from Misaki of all people,\nit must be significant.
Besides, if you're covering Pierre,\nthat lets the defense focus on Napoleon.
We're counting on you, Misaki.
Thank you, Matsuyama.
Sounds good to me, too.\nI get exactly how that feels, Misaki!
Kojiro...
A man's gotta settle things one-on-one with\nhis rival! What good's a win that you regret?
Thank you, Kojiro.
Man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
Well, if you can keep Pierre busy,\nour defense can totally shut down Napoleon!
I know you can do it, Misaki! Worse comes\nto worst, we're all right behind you!
Thanks guys!
Alright, let's do this guys!
Right beside ya!
(Here we come, France!\nThat spot in the finals is ours!)
(So it's finally time\nto settle things with Misaki.)
(Today I'll beat both you and your team!\nThis is the opportunity I've prepared for!)
What was that?! Say that again to my face, punk!
What, that was too difficult for you to\nunderstand? Truly, your idiocy is impressive.
Ta gueule!
Losing your temper is precisely why you keep\ngetting suspensions. Don't you ever learn?
Frankly, I'm not sure why a violent boy\nlike you is even allowed to represent France.
Whatever! Wait 'til I get my hands on you!
Cut it out, you two! We're right before a match!
You stay outta this, Pierre!
He's the captain! How can\nyou even speak to him like that?
Now will you two behave yourselves?
...
...
I don't need to tell you how important this\ntournament is to everyone on the team, now do I?
Ugh...
...I'm sorry.
Focus on the game. Do you really think the\nsemifinals will be so easy that we can win while\nyou two are at each other's throat?
And that goes for the rest of you, too.\nJapan is the real deal. This isn't\njust a fluke or a dark horse or whatever.
Without a doubt, they're one of the best\nteams here. And we won't beat them\nwithout our heads in the right place.
Napoleon. Jean. You're the keys to our offense\nand defense. We need you on top of your game.
Sure thing. I'll take care of our D,\nso you go put the ball in their net.
Hmph! Who do you think you're talking to?\nI'll get us more goals than we'll ever need.\nI'm the world's best striker, after all.
You sure are.
Ever since the day they stole our tournament,\nwe've put everything into proving\nwhy we deserve our recognition!
Just two more games! We're taking that\nchampionship, and taking back our pride!
Tak!
Alright folks, the Junior Youth World Challenge\nhas been one intense match after another, but all\nthat remains are the semifinals and finals!
And with Japan advancing to the semifinals,\nour first match is Japan vs. France!
Before the tournament, I doubt anyone would've\nimagined Japan making it all the way here.
Ever since we first saw them, they've shown us\ntheir spirit and their guts, as they turned\ninto a team worthy of worldwide notice!
After even defeating favorites to win,\nit is beyond a shadow of a doubt that\nthey are real contenders for the world title!
But their opponent today is France, a team\nthat appears virtually perfect in their play!
Team striker, Napoleon, has scored the most of\nany player in this tournament! Their defense led\nby Jean hasn't let a single point through!
Pulling the team together with his leadership is\nthe French General himself, playmaker Pierre!
And while of course their players are amazing,\nthey've also got something\nelse driving them today!
Revenge for their homeland! France was\nrobbed of hosting their own tournament!
It's because of these intensely patriotic\nfeelings that they're all fired up to play!
So which of these teams will win today and earn\ntheir ticket to the finals? France?! Or Japan?!
We'll find out following the kickoff!
Do you remember our agreement, Misaki?
Of course I do. I'm not hiding!
I'm coming for you, I'm coming for Japan,\nand France is going to the finals.
Not my plan to lose either, y'know.
Can you two cut out the romance?\nLet's start the match already!
Nice to see you too, Napoleon.
Hmph. I'm not expecting much,\nbut do your best out there.
Hey Tsubasa, that's Napoleon.
Yeah?
I'm sure you can tell the kinda guy he is,\nbut he's got more than just muscle.
Yeah, we saw his combo with Pierre last match.
Exactly.
So this isn't just a showdown between you and\nPierre then. It's also between us and them.
Let's show them our duo is better than anyone's,\nMisaki!
You took the words right out of my mouth, Tsubasa!
Yo, Takasugi.
What's up?
That pass play they've got, the Eiffel Tower\nwhatcha-ma-callit, is crazy. It's at least as good\nas Misaki and Tsubasa's, if ya ask me.
Really? You think so?
All I'm sayin' is that it's gonna be tough\nto take head on. So I got Sano to look into it.
So it's named for a tower in Paris? I hear they\npicture the lines of the tower and climb it\ntogether. Basically, they go right for the goal.
(Sano must have it rough.)
And when I heard that, a light bulb just went off.
If they've got a tower, how about we have two?
What?
Jeez, where's your imagination?
Who're the two Japanese giants\nwho thrashed Nationals and\neven shocked audiences durin' prelims?
Us! We could be Japan's two towers!
I mean, I guess we're pretty tall...
So hear me out. We're gonna show 'em\nwhat Japan's giants can do!
Think, a Towering Duo Defense!
Going up against the Eiffel Tower with\na Towering Duo, huh? Sounds like a blast.
Count me in. We'll stop France together, Jito!
I knew y'were a real man, Takasugi!\nFrance won't know what hit 'em!
Darn right!
Here we come, France! Get out of our way!
Let's do this, Misaki! For\nJapan!
I'm ready for you, Pierre!
I've got your back, Misaki!
(I've perfected a new technique\njust for you, Misaki!)
You won't know what hit ya, Pierre!
You can't touch me now, Misaki!
This is my Étoile Roulette!
No way!
Gah, I was careless!
I'd expect no less!
Is he that much better than I...\n?!
I win, Pierre!
So you're Tsubasa...
I can't lose here!
That's real power!
We're evenly matched?!
You can't strong arm me!
I won't lose! Not to you!
Not bad, Napoleon!
What'd you expect?
Ace Killer Makoto Soda, \nreporting for duty!
Hmph, like am I supposed to\nknow you?
What are you doing?!
Oh no you don't!
Take this! Razor Tackle!
You wanna get stepped on, punk?!
Soda and Napoleon are getting into a heated\nexchange! The ref has blown his whistle!
This doesn't look good! Soda and Napoleon\nare really starting to duke it out!
Oh, now you've done it, you jerk!
Don't mess with me!\nYou're the one who threw the first fist!
For the love of...! Cut it out, Napoleon!
Both teams are trying to separate them!\nEven the benches are about to clear!
Calm down, Soda!
Enough already! You want another suspension?!
Their teammates have managed to restrain them,\nso at least things won't escalate further.
But this clearly is clearly unacceptable behavior!\nBoth Soda and Napoleon have been given yellow\ncards!
Grah! Lemme go!
Napoleon.
Ouch! Looks like Captain Pierre just tried\nto literally slap some sense into Napoleon.
Pierre!
Do you understand, Napoleon? We're not here\nfor your frolicking or to get into fights.
We're here for France. For ourselves.\nTo restore our honor. Take it seriously.
Soccer is about combining all of our individual\nstrengths. It's a team sport. Pull something\nselfish like this again and you're done!
Got that, Napoleon?!
Pierre...
(Elle Sid Pierre.)
(Not only are his plays magnificent,\nhe has the bearing of a captain.)
(What an amazing guy.)
No need to get so worked up, Soda.
Don't let him provoke you.
Yeah, I get it.
My bad. Dunno what came over me.
What's done is done.
Just make sure to focus on the match!\nGet it together, guys!
Still got any complaints you wanna\nfile with the front office?
Looks like your Razor's a\nlittle rusty!
You're not gettin' past me!
Stop me if you can!
I just can't lose to him.
What? Is that all?
The Shield of France is going\nto be dented by my cleats!
Come back with a plan next\ntime!
That's how it's done, baby!\nGuess I'm still the king of scoring!
Don't let us down, Napoleon.
Who do you think you're talking to?\nI'm not like those other useless chumps!
And a goal for the field commander, Pierre!
That's why he's a definitive all-rounder!\nHe's not just a playmaker!
Don't get sloppy now, guys. Pull it together\nand there'll be more where that came from!
Tak!
And Misaki does it!
A splendid goal from the Artist of the Field,\nmatching Pierre stride for stride!
You see that, Pierre?\nI'll beat both you and your team!
Let's do this, Napoleon!
Tak! Aiming right for the top of the tower,\nas always!
I... lost?!
I won't lose to anyone\nanymore!
No way! How?!
Outta my way!
He broke through?!
Send everyone you got! You'll\nnever get through!
Sloppy pass-work like that\nwill never work!
Im-Impossible!
No way! He stopped me and\nMisaki!
Here we go, guys! Charge!
Woohoo! Nice one, Pierre!
You see that, world? That's France's new game!
And that's the first half!
Japan's riding the momentum of their perfect\nwin record and maintaining the lead!
And that's the first half!
Both teams are refusing to budge\non their perfect win records!
Neither will yield a goal to the other!\nThey're tied!
And that's the first half!
Maybe Japan's exhausted after all their tough\nmatches, but they're missing that certain\nsomething today! France is rocking them!
Okay guys, that first half was brilliant.
But France has been unstoppable this tournament.\nDon't let your guard down, ever!
Yes, Sir!
Sorry guys. If I'd been keeping Pierre\nin check this match would be way easier.
C'mon, who cares? We're winning!
Yeah, Pierre's obviously tripping up a bit\naround you. That's more than enough.
I guess... Thanks.
But to think he'd improve so much since\nwe clashed in France. It's unsettling.
C'mon, you've improved plenty too, haven't you?
And whatever happens, we'll back you up.\nSo you just show him what you can do!
Thanks, Tsubasa.
Yeah, the game ain't over yet.\nYou still got time to settle the score.
And you too, Kojiro.
(Right... All I've been thinking about is\nhow much I don't want to lose,\nor to not get in my teammates' way.)
(As a result, I'm shrinking away from\nthe challenge and being overly cautious.)
(But even if I lose, even if I can't beat Pierre,\nmy teammates will be there for me.)
(So I can devote everything\nto getting the job done!)
It's not just Pierre we need to watch out for,\nthough. Napoleon's just as dangerous.
Yeah. His play is a bit rough,\nbut he's got something else going on, too.
As a defender, he's got good spatial awareness,\nbut he's a jerk.
Both of them are trouble on their\nown, but what we really need to\nwatch out for is their combo play.
They're sure to keep attempting that\nEiffel Tower Rush of theirs in the next half.
We can't forget that Jean guy, either.
True. He's also holding their\ndefensive line together from the rear.
If we can't shake his mark,\ngetting more goals is gonna be tough.
Yes, but if you turn that around, that means\nthe French defense relies on him too much.\nJust something to keep in mind.
Alright! I feel better already!
That said, if you compare the whole teams,\nthere isn't much difference in skill\nbetween us and the French.
Which is why even one slip-up could be enough\nfor them to turn this whole thing around.
They'll be more desperate then, in the\nsecond half. So we need to be ready for it.
Misugi's right. This isn't the sort of match\nwe can relax in, even with our lead.
I want you to think of this as restarting\nthe game from zero and give it 110%!
That's how we'll win this,\nand advance to the finals!
Time to bring it!
That Napoleon jerk... I still gotta pay\nhim back for what he did to me!
You realize that could cost us the match?
Take your anger out on the ball, okay?
If you pick a fight, I'm gonna stop you.
What was that?!
<avatar_name>'s right, Soda.\nYou've already got a yellow card.
Exactly. One more and you're off the field.
Tch, I know! I know!
I'm not THAT dumb.
<avatar_name>'s right. We'll be in real trouble\nif your temper gets you kicked out of the game.
Fine! I'll make sure it doesn't come to that.
I sure hope so because one more yellow card\nand you're gone. And even I'm\nnot nice enough to overlook that.
If you're gonna pick a fight,\nyou gotta get through me first!
Fine, fine, I get it. I don't want the team\nto suffer either, so I'll try to hold it in.
Still, I AM the Ace Killer.\nAnd that guy's getting nowhere on my watch!
That I do like to hear!
Darn right! He's about to get\nthe edge of my Razor!
Apparently the points I scored didn't mean much.
I coulda sworn someone here said\nsomething like "I'll take care of our defense."
Didn't you hear something like that, Jean?
And how many goals did you score? If you'd\nscored more, wouldn't we have the lead?
Heh. Big talk coming from a guy who just\nrevealed his incompetence to the world.
It doesn't matter how many points I get us\nif you losers can't keep their offense out.
Sheesh, it's like arguing with a toddler.
What was that?!
The moment things don't go your way,\nyou start blaming it on everyone else.\nBut it's never your fault, now is it?
There's no way we're winning with\na brat like you on the team.
Hey now, I coulda sworn someone here said\nsomething like "I'll take care of our defense!"
But I guess that didn't happen, because look!\nWe're losing! Ain't that right, Jean?
That reminds me, didn't some braggart tell us\nhe could get us more points than we'd need?\nWhat do you suppose happened to that?
Because it couldn't possibly be the case that\nthat guy didn't score a single point and came\ncrawling back here like a loser, could it?
I mean, that'd be crazy, don't you think?
You shut your mouth!
Gah!
P-Pierre...
Still worked up, Napoleon?
...
You too, Jean.\nYou know better than to provoke him.
...
Anyway, there's no reason for you two to fight.
Because I take full responsibility\nfor what happened in the first half.
Wha...?
But Pierre!
If I'd been a better playmaker,\nwe could've had the lead by now.
Besides, I've been too focused on offense,\nand not paying attention to the burden\nI was placing on our defense.
That's not true and you know it.\nI'm responsible for our defense.
Heh... In the presence of Pierre,\nisn't one expected to be humble?
...
My mistake.
You did fine, Jean.\nBut that's not enough for us to win.
That why I'm changing our strategy for\nthe second half. I'll be joining in on defense.
Hold on! You don't have to do that, Pierre!
I mean, I know they got us in the first half,\nbut next time it'll be different!
Jean. If we give up any more points, we might\nreally lose all chance of winning this.
We need to win this tournament at all costs.\nAm I mistaken?
...
If your pride is more than just\nlocker room bragging, then you can't deny\nthat our opponents are good.
...Understood, Captain. We'll do it your way.
Alright guys, we've still got an ace up our\nsleeve, and no point in holding it back now!\nBe ready to follow my lead!
Really?
You mean...!
F-For real?!
But Pierre!
Whoa there, weren't we gonna save\nthat for the finals?
If we don't win this, there won't be\nany finals for us. There's a time and a place\nfor playing coy, and this isn't it.
I guess... Well, whatever.
I'm sure you've all realized by now that\nJapan poses a real threat to our advancement.
But if you keep the faith and trust your team,\nwe can still win the day.
And in the end,\nwe'll be the ones headed to finals!
Vive la France!
Don't worry, guys, ending the half tied\nis about as good as we could've hoped for.
We've stayed strong across the field so far.\nAll that's left is to play this thing out.
Of course, France isn't a team that's\ngoing to just sit tight.
They've got a lot riding on this tournament,\nso there's no way they'll let up.
Yes, Sir!
Sorry guys. If I'd been keeping Pierre in check\nmaybe we could've taken the lead.
C'mon, it's not like we're losing.\nDon't worry about it.
Yeah, Pierre's obviously tripping up a bit\naround you. That's more than enough.
I guess... Thanks.
But to think he'd improve so much since\nwe clashed in France. It's unsettling.
C'mon, you've improved plenty too, haven't you?
And whatever happens, we'll back you up.\nSo you just show him what you can do!
Thanks, Tsubasa.
Yeah, the game ain't over yet.\nYou still got time to settle this.
And you too, Kojiro.
(Right... All I've been thinking about is\nhow much I don't want to lose,\nor to not get in my teammates' way.)
(As a result, I'm shrinking away from\nthe challenge and being overly cautious.)
(But even if I lose, even if I can't beat Pierre,\nmy teammates will be there for me.)
(So I can devote everything\nto getting the job done!)
It's not just Pierre we need to watch out for,\nthough. Napoleon's just as dangerous.

We can't forget that Jean guy, either.
True. He's also holding their\ndefensive line together from the rear.
If we can't shake his mark,\nit's going to be tough to pull ahead.
Yes, but if you turn that around, that means\nthe French defense relies on him too much.\nJust something to keep in mind.
Ooh, I feel like I'm finally seeing\nthe light at the end of the tunnel.
If you compare the whole teams, there isn't\nmuch difference in skill between us and France.
Which is why even one slip-up\ncould be enough to decide the match.
They'll be more desperate then, in the\nsecond half. So we need to be ready for it.
Misugi's right. We've been even matched so far,\nso who knows how it'll all fall out.
I want you to think of this as restarting\nthe game from zero and give it 110%!
That's how we'll win this,\nand advance to the finals!
Tak!
Sorry guys. You've all been\nplaying better than ever.
It's my fault, as the playmaker,\nthat we couldn't pull ahead.
Ha! Yeah right.
If Jean could pull it together\nwe wouldn't be talking about this.
Do you really want to turn this\ninto an argument again, Napoleon?
It's fine... And I can't refute that.
Hmph. Guess I'll just need to score even more\npoints to make up for your useless butt.
I hate to admit it,\nbut they really did get me good back there.
But I have my own pride.\nI won't let them score again!
I hate to break it to you, Pierre,\nbut it's pretty clear who's fault this really is.
If Napoleon had gotten even one point,\nwe might be a lot better off.
Save it, Jean.
No! I've had enough of this! Jeez,\nand after all that bragging before the match!\nCan you back up any of what you said?!
Shut your mouth! I still got time\nto clean house in the second half!
I just hope you actually manage\nto do it this time.
Just watch me! I've been the\nnumber one striker this whole tournament!\nAnd I'm not backing down now!
Go for it. And to help you out,\nI'll be sending you great passes all the way.
Alright, just you wait!
I'm sure you all realized it in the first half,\nbut Japan's better than we expected.
I assumed the match would be as good as over\nafter I'd beaten Misaki one-on-one.
But with each of them covering for each other,\nall of them are playing several times better\nthan they would on their own.
Yeah. Watching from the back, I feel like each\nof us is better than any of them, but you've got\nto respect how they shore each other up.
And no matter how many times I blow past them,\nthey keep on swarming me, like buzzing\nlittle bees. It's seriously annoying.
Exactly. Japan's strength comes from their unity.\nThat's why we need to fight back... As a team.
We've still got an ace up our sleeve, and no\npoint in hiding it now! Be ready for my signal.
Really?
You mean it?
F-For real?!
But Pierre!
Whoa there, weren't we gonna\nsave that for the finals?
If we don't win this, there won't be\nany finals for us. There's a time and a place\nfor playing coy, and this isn't it.
Well, you heard the man, Napoleon.\nOr did that fly over your head, too?
You tryin' to start something?
Cut it out. They'll take advantage of\nany weakness we present, so there's\nno reason to make it easy for them.
Tch. Fine!
This tournament was stolen from us.\nFrance was hosting. Remember?! You better.\nKeep that at the forefront of your minds.
All of our hard work was so we could pay them\nback for that! That's what we came here for!
We're reclaiming the pride of France! And to do\nthat, we need to win! No matter the cost!
Let's show the world what\nFrench soccer is all about!
Vive la France!
I know we're behind, guys,\nbut don't let it get to you.
There's not much difference in skill\nbetween the teams, so with a little more focus,\nwe can hold our own.
France has been unstoppable all tournament,\nbut you guys have been, too!
I know better than anyone just how much work\nyou've put in and how much you've improved.
And that's how I know nothing is impossible\nfor you! There's no wall\nyou can't smash right through!
Just give it your all, and win this!
We can do it!
Sorry guys. This never would've happened\nif I'd been keeping Pierre in check.
Nah, don't worry about it.\nPierre's even better than we thought.
Yeah, what he's showing us today is\non another level from what we saw\nfrom him in the quarterfinals.
Maybe it takes a better opponent\nto bring out the beast in him.
Yeah, I underestimated how much better\nhe'd become since we played together in France.\nTo be honest, it's kind of frustrating.
C'mon, Misaki! You've put in plenty of effort,\ntoo! We've all improved.
We're packing more than enough to beat Pierre!
Tsubasa...
And don't worry! We'll be there when you need us.
Yeah, we've still got another half!\nNeither the game or your faceoff are over yet!
Thanks, you two.
They've got their eyes on you too, Misaki. No one\nbut you could hope to keep Pierre busy like that.
So cheer up! You can't go out there\nacting like you already lost.
Be strong! Show your worth!
Thank you so much, guys...
(Right... All I've been thinking about is\nhow much I don't want to lose,\nor to not get in my teammates' way.)
(As a result, I'm shrinking away from\nthe challenge and being overly cautious.)
(But even if I lose, even if I can't beat Pierre,\nmy teammates will be there for me.)
(So I can devote everything\nto getting the job done!)
Alright, I'll do it! I'll win this for us!
You can do it, Misaki! Let's win this together!
For sure!
(I'm so lucky to play\nbeside such wonderful teammates.)
It's not just Pierre we need to watch out for\nthough. Napoleon's just as dangerous.
Yeah. His play is a bit rough,\nbut he's got something else going on, too.
As a defender, he's got good spatial awareness,\nbut he's a jerk.
Both of them are a problem on their own,\nbut what we really need to watch out for\nis their combo play.
Especially an Eiffel Tower Rush\nright after Jean intercepts a ball.\nThey can turn around surprisingly fast.
Yeah, I guess that Jean guy's a pain, too.
Yeah, it's like he's figured out\nour whole offense all on his own.
And he's just so fast. Once he's marked you,\nit's practically all over.
So do we just have to try to stay away from him?
No, absolutely not.
Matsuyama?
Sure, Jean's amazing, but both America and Uruguay\ntried to avoid him and look what happened.
That's just what he wants.
Besides, from what I can tell France's defense\nis nothing special. Only Jean is.
So if we can take Jean out of the picture,\nthey'll be helpless. And that's our chance.
Also, I've noticed something about how he plays.\nHe hardly ever takes control of the ball,\npreferring to pass it off ASAP.
Maybe that's something we can use.
Just leave it to us! It doesn't matter how strong\nthe defense is, Misaki and I can handle it!
We need to defend against Napoleon,\nkeep Pierre pinned down in the midfield,\nand break through Jean's defense line.
They're tough, but with this three-pronged attack\nplaying to our strengths, we can fight back.
And, uh, what are our strengths again?
Just how many amazing players do you think\nwe've gone up against so far?
And what gets them every time is us covering\neach other's weaknesses. We fight as one.
Got it.
Misugi's right.
As long as we continue to support each other\nwithout getting caught up in what our roles are,\nwe're more than just eleven players!
Teamwork is our ultimate weapon!
Isn't that right, Misugi?
Heh. You took the words right out of my mouth.
The first half is in the past, but from what\nI can see, France is no better than us, as a team.
Let's try to focus more on combo plays, without\nforgetting to support each other when necessary.
So basically, it's all about guts and teamplay!\nJust, y'know, more than usual!
Makes sense.
How Ishizaki-esque.
All that's left is to put it into action!
Zróbmy to!
Here we go! Time to turn this game around!
And then we're going to the finals!
Let's do it!
And here I was, wondering what kinda amazing team\nmade it all the way to the semifinals.
Those're the tough guys? This is the team\nyou were warning us about, Pierre?
I mean, it's not like they're bad.\nWe're just better than we've ever been.
I suppose...
(Sure, I was confident.\nBut I beat Misaki so easily.)
(Is that really all you have to show me, Misaki?)
Well, at least they're the perfect opponents\nfor me to rack up points on.\nGotta keep that top scorer stat.
And who do you think's going to have to clean up\nyour mess when you screw up? Be serious.
Sure, whatever you say, punk.\nJust stay outta my way.
Do what you like... As long as we win.
Maybe I should just kick back\nand relax this match.
Maybe you'd have earned it\nif you'd actually done anything so far.
What was that?!
Just stating the facts. Did I hurt your feelings?
Don't mess with me!\nWe've got another full half left!\nMore than enough time for a hat trick or two!
Heh. Well, I prefer that to you slacking off.
I've been wondering this for awhile now, Jean...
Is there something wrong with you\nwhere you can't just pipe down?
That's rich, coming from you.
You two cut it out. We're winning,\nbut you can't start goofing off, now.
Seriously? You worry about you, Pierre.\nI haven't lost my focus.
A little argument with this bum\nisn't enough to distract me either.\nYou know. I'm better than that.
What'd you call me?!
I told you two to knock it off!
R-Right...
Sorry.
We may have the lead, but our opponents have been\ncoming back to win against other great teams time\nand again.
Listen up, all of you! If we have the chance\nto run "that" in the second half,\nwe're taking it! Stay on your toes!
What?!
Seriously?
You mean it?
Pierre...!
You sure we want to use our secret weapon, now?\nWouldn't it be best to keep it\nhidden until the championship game?
We need to secure our spot in the finals.
And we've never used it in a real match.\nWe should give it a go and fine tune it\nfor when we might really need it.
Okay. Captain's orders.
Everyone! We're not giving Japan\nthe chance to score! This win belongs to us!
Yeah, we'll keep them on the defensive.
Save some of the fun for me.\nI'll put on a show for everyone in goal.
We'll head to the finals\nand reclaim our honor... for France!
Oui!
(Misaki... I'm winning today\nand heading to the top!)
The All Japan team has taken the lead\nand the game is in their favor...
...but France surely has something in the works.
We're about to start the second half. Which side\nwill prevail and progress to the finals?
Now that's what I call a semifinal!\nWe are tied at the half with neither team\nallowing the other to get the lead!
Which of these undefeated teams will\nsuffer their first loss here?\nWe'll have to see what the second half brings!
The match is about to resume from halftime!
Japan is trailing at the half due to France's\nmagnificent soccer! But I'm sure Japan has\nsomething planned for the second half.
They've continued to surprise the world with\ntheir soccer. Will they be able to get their\nhands on that golden ticket to the finals?
The match is about to resume from halftime!
Here I come, Pierre!
Do you dare, Misaki?
We're right behind you,\nMisaki!
(Pierre... You've improved more than I thought.)
(But I've been working twice\nas hard as a Japanese representative!)
Here I come, Pierre!\nI'm not going to lose this time!
Bring it on, Misaki! You're not getting past me!
What just happened?!
We did it, everyone!
Here I come, Jean!
Try as many times as you like, it won't matter!
Jean's got the ball... Now!
Wh-What?!
They got through Jean?!
Go, Misaki!
You got it, Tsubasa!
You're more annoying than\nJean!
I'll stop you in your tracks!
Pierre! This'll be my last\ngambit!
Bring it on, Misaki! Let's\nsettle this!
I... I can do this!
I couldn't pull it off. Sorry,\nteam...
I don't know the meaning of the word "quit"!
We've got to win this match! Because...
I want to keep playing soccer\nwith you and everyone else!
Misaki...
Well, let's win then!
You can say that again!
Goal! France's ace striker,\nLouis Napoleon scores a hat trick!
J'ai réussi! Did you see that? That's what\nmakes me the best forward on the planet!
Incroyable, Napoleon!
He does say he's France's ace striker.\nI'd expect nothing less of 'im.
Heh. I've done my part. If we lose,\nit'll be on you, Jean, and the defensive team.
Yeah, I understand.
Everyone! Now! Execute\n"Conqueror"!
Look at that! The entire team has gone on the offensive!
This is the strategy built of our blood, sweat,\nand tears! This is France's true strength!
Our Towering Duo Defense!
I won't let you...
And that's the match!
Japan did it!
They beat France in a fierce match\nand earned their ticket through to the\nJunior Youth World Challenge finals!
That's the end of the second half, folks!
And what a semifinals match this is!\nBoth teams, undefeated, have not let\ntheir opponents get out ahead!
This match for the ages is heading into overtime!
And that's the match!
A disappointing loss for Japan!
Their momentum and growth in this tournament\nhas been halted by the passionate play\nof the French team!
Their run ends here at the semifinals!
They deserve a round of applause!
I'll keep it simple. Keep up the pace and throw\neverything including the kitchen sink at France!
Yessir!
Just remember, if we're feeling the pain,\nthen they're feeling it, too!
Muster up everything you've got\nin overtime and get some points!
Alright!
Could I say something?
Of course.
I know I joined the team late, but I've been\nhaving the time of my life playing with you guys.
That's why I want to continue playing soccer with\nall of you, even if just for a little longer.
You mean you're headed back to France\nafter the tournament is over?
That's right...which is I don't want\nthis match to be our last.
I'll give 110% for whatever remaining time we\nhave. And maybe we'll see the next round together.
Misaki... You know we feel the same.
Tsubasa...
That's why we'll win this match. Not just for\nJapan, but for Misaki, too! Got it, everyone?
Tak! Zróbmy to!
We've come so far.\nLet's catch our breath and see this through.
We're counting on you in overtime, too, Misaki.
Thanks, everyone. I won't let you down!
Let's go, guys! We've got a game to win!
Tak!
(It doesn't matter where I am. I am who I am.)
(I'll be sure to advance with this team,\nand be a part of representing Japan honorably!)
Zut! I missed.
If we have to play in the finals, this overtime\nwill make it hard to play at our best.
We've given it our all against Japan,\nor at least, we think we have.
But I think somewhere in the back of our minds,\nwe were trying to save our stamina for the finals.
As much as I hate to agree, I can't deny that.
But Japan is much better than we expected.\nWe can't allow ourselves to hold back.
I hate to admit it, but you're right.
Stop thinking about the finals.\nIf we don't give it our all and win this match,\nwe won't even get to play in that game!
Oui! I'm not letting anyone stop me\nwhen it comes to being top scorer!
We bear the Shield of France, and the\nwhole world will know about it soon enough!
It's time to show Japan what\nFrench pride is about!
And we will be the victorious!
Oui!
Japan vs. France is about to head into overtime!
Who will come out the winner\nof this heated battle?
Or will we have to settle it in a shootout?
It's time for the kickoff! Don't dare blink!
I can't lose! Not now!
Vive la France! We will win!
It's time for a little payback,\nMisaki!
I'm ready for you, Pierre!
That's the end of the first half of overtime!
Japan has broken the dead heat with perfect form,\nand pulled into the lead!
That's the end of the first half of overtime!
Both sides are putting up a good fight!\nWe're still tied at the half!
That's the end of the first half of overtime!
Japan could not stop France's aggression and has\ngiven up the lead in a troubling turn of events.
Will we see them recover in the second half?\nOnly time will tell!
I know things are rough out there,\nbut you guys are doing a great job.
All that's left is this second half of overtime.
Just trust the way you've been playing\nand stick with it to the end. Got it?
Yessir!
(Damn that Jean! His man-to-man defense\nis even tighter than Tsubasa's.)
(And boy can he sprint. A through pass won't\namount to anything if I can't shake him.)
(There isn't much time left.\nI've got to do something about him...)
Nitta, you look troubled.
Urabe...
We've played together for a long time.\nI know what's on your mind.
I've actually got a plan.
Do you now?
You remember the Shizuoka Regional Finals, right?
Obviously.
Well, it's the same deal. I have faith in you,\nbut I need you to trust me, too.
You don't mean...
That's exactly what I mean.
You've got the fastest feet on this team.\nYou're the only one that can beat Jean\nin a battle of speed.
And only I can set you up a proper pass\nbecause I'm the only one who understands\nyour true potential.
Urabe...
But...can I really do it?
Oh, quit worrying. If it doesn't work,\nit'll be my fault; but if you DO score a goal,\nthat'll be all you.
So it's time to pull out all the stops, got it?
Y-Yes! Let's do it!
La vache! These guys are tough.
I don't think even one of 'em doesn't\nbelieve they got this in the bag.
They are the epitome of a team.\nAnd they're darn good, too.
But we haven't lost yet.\nOur team hasn't lost yet. Right, Napoleon?
Hmph. That's the last thing\nI'd expect you to have to ask.
No one's just gonna roll over and die.
Use that determination, you two.
Listen here. We're just about out of gas.
Japan's been a worthy adversary, but it's time\nfor one last push to send them packin'.
Oui!
After a short halftime, both teams return\nto the stage of this fierce battle.
Neither team is thinking about the finals\nat this point. I'm sure this match\nis the only thing on their minds.
We are about to see the final act\nof the Japan vs. France semifinal!
Who will be headed home when the final whistle\nblows, and who will get their hands\non the golden ticket to the tournament finals?
And the second overtime half begins!
(Now!)
(Urabe!)
(Go, Nitta!)
Urabe has the ball and has cleared it\ntoward the French side of the field.
But wait a minute! Nitta has locked into a sprint\ntoward the opposite side of the field!
And he runs right past Jean!
(Sacrebleu! I see what he's doing!)
It looked like Urabe was clearing the ball,\nbut as Nitta runs down the field,\nit seems to be a super long pass!
And Jean has seen right through the deception, as\nhe has turned around and is hot on Nitta's heels!
(I hate to admit it, but Jean is faster than me.)
(But I've got a good head start.\nI can beat Jean to the ball!)
Nitta's covering a lot of ground! But Jean is\ngaining on him with unbelievable agility!
There's no way I'll let you get the ball!
(Gah, Jean! Why are you so fast?)
Oops! That pass may have been a\nlittle too long. I don't think either\nplayer will get to it in time!
Now we see Amoros leaving the\ngoalpost to pursue it!
He's not going to make it!
(Oh no! He needs to widen his stride\nso Jean can't catch up!)
(C'mon Nitta! I know you can do it!)
(Damn it's still so far away!\nI'm going full force, but I still don't know\nwhether I'll get there in time!)
(And Jean and their keeper are coming fast\nfrom either side. If I don't have time\nto set my feet for the shot...)
(I'll just have to run full out\nand shoot the ball straight ahead!)
And it looks like Nitta is picking up speed!\nBut can he really take an accurate shot\nmoving at that pace?
(I've never done this before,\nbut there's no room for error, either.)
(This is something I have to do. For the team!)
(Urabe put his trust in me.\nI will score with this ball!)
(That's just part of being a forward for Japan!)
The ball lands in front of the three players!\nWho'll get to it first?!\nWill it be Nitta, Jean, or Amoros?
Now!
The three of them dive toward the ball\nat the same time!
G-GOOOAAAL!
In a do-or-die moment during the last half of the\ngame, Nitta gets off a super-long Falcon Shot!\nAnd it finds the back of France's goal!
Tak! I did it!
You did! Nice shot, Nitta!
We made it work, Urabe!
I knew you would pull through, Nitta!
Thank you for believing in me!
That was amazing! I haven't seen that shot\nsince the Shizuoka Regionals!
You're not the only one who's gotten better,\ny'know. Next time we play, you'll be\nin for a real challenge, Tsubasa.
I can see that.
Alright! Let's go and wrap this game up!
Tak! In it to win it!
I can't believe I let them\nget off a counteroffensive play.
Forget about it, Jean. It's time to switch gears.\nThe game isn't over yet.
Sorry...
We don't know the meaning of the word defeat!\nLet's go, men!
That's the end of overtime!
After a long match that led to overtime,\nit's Japan that comes out victorious!
Japan wins the semifinal to advance to the finals!
But France's performance was a true spectacle\nunto itself, as well! The packed stadium is\nsending them off with cheers and applause!
The All-Japan team is just one win away from\nbecoming world champions. We await their return\nto the pitch to fight for the title!
Both teams performed magnificently today!\nLet's let them hear how much we appreciate it!
That whistle marks the end of overtime!
Both teams have fought hard throughout this\nlong match, but we've run out of time.
The Japan vs. France semifinal ends in a tie,\ndespite an overtime period!
The fate of the game will be decided\nwith a penalty shootout!
Both teams will now prepare for the shootout.\nWho will the goddess of victory smile upon today?
That's the end of overtime!
Japan held their own to the very end, but it was\nFrance's passion and pride that prevailed!
Unfortunately, Japan's run in the tournament\nends here at the semifinals!
Great game out there, guys.
All that's left for us to do\nis to win the shootout!
Tsubasa...
You're right. We really played our best out there.
All that remains is a shootout.\nYou don't need me to tell you this, but go out\nthere and throw everything you have left at 'em!
Yes, Coach!
It finally happened. We couldn't get the win.
We've still got a shootout. If we don't win,\nthough, all our effort's going to waste.
Vous avez raison. We're in it to win it.
Okay, team! We've got a showdown of a shootout to\nwin! Keep calm, and just do as we practiced!
It's time for our last stand! Zróbmy to!
Tak!
Zrobili to! Japan has won the\npenalty shootout and this hard-fought match!
The finals await Team Japan!
Japan has been relentless in this semifinal,\npushing all the way to a penalty shootout,\nbut they could not outstrip France's tenacity!
Japan's dream of advancing to the finals ends\nhere. They've been eliminated in the semifinals.
We did it, Misaki! We won!
We did! We beat France!
We did it, Mom! We're going to the finals!
We're one step away from winning\nand becoming the world champs!
It's been a long journey, but we're almost there.
Agreed. I'm amazed at the team we've\nbecome--standing shoulder to shoulder\nwith some of the world's best.
Worst case scenario, we'll still be second best.
Don't start talkin' that way, bro!\nWe've come all this way. Just one more to go.
That's right. Erase the idea\nof failure from your mind.
We'll prove to the world who's the best!
Jito and Takasugi really made\nthe difference today.
France seemed to have trouble\ndealing with your height.
Yeah. I don't even wanna imagine what today\nwould've been like without you two.
Ha! I'd expect nothing\nless from our Towering Duo.
Towering Duo?
That's not really...
Takasugi! Stand tall and proud!\nThere'd be no Towering Duo without you!
Is that what you guys call yourselves now?
Some people seem to be...
I see. Since you two tower over everyone...\nI guess that's clever.
They've only got one tower, so I figured using\ntwo on our side was the perfect counter-strategy.
(What tower is he... Don't tell me he was looking\nat my research notes about the Eiffel Tower Rush?)
You're the pride of Japan, ya big lug!
You'd have a hard time against the Tachibanas.
You guys have a name now? Jealous!
Ya should be! Keep those pretty words comin'.
(<avatar_name> really knows how\nto bring the best of Jito out.)
Hehe, just what I was thinking, <avatar_name>!
That's right! Our Skylab sails above all\nstructures. We go up to the stratosphere!
Bah! In that case I'll launch\nTakasugi into the air!
Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea...
How about you and me team up\nto make the "Freshman Duo," then?
Include Nitta and myself\nand we could become the "Underclassmen Quartet"!
You know... the idea is already growin' on me.
In any case, we owe a lot to the two of you.
Don' worry. The Towering Duo Defense'll\nstand strong come finals, too!
We'll see what the coach has to say first.
Man, we're here getting all hyped up\nand you just had to be the party pooper.
Hahaha!
(I was only able to give it my all\nafter Jito pushed me to,\nbut I'm glad things worked out this way.)
(Hopefully this proves that\nI was able to accomplish something worthy\nas a defender for Japan.)
(Thank you, Jito.)
Sorry, everyone, this is on me.
Napoleon...
I ran my mouth but couldn't deliver the goods.
Forget it, Napoleon.
Jean...
France was able to get this far,\nin no small part, thanks to you.
We got outplayed. That's all there is to it.
I can't believe you're the one cheering me up.\nUgh, I think there's something in my eye.
You'll be fine.\nStill plenty of fight left in you yet.
Zut! I won't accept it.
We're only in this situation\nbecause you didn't stop those shots.
Hah. We would've won if you came through\nwith your promise and scored more goals.
I DID score, thank you very much.
And I stopped their attacks countless times.
But Japan was just too good.\nThat's pretty much the whole story.
Yeah. It's pointless arguing\nafter we've already lost...
Let's call it a truce.
I mean, we did lose and all.
Us... Losing... *sniffle*
No sobbing. We've got to hold our heads up high,\neven if we lost.
Pierre...
I think I speak for all of us when I say it hurts.
Victory evaded us today, but everyone\ncontributed to the team getting this far.
Yeah, you're right.
The crowd knows we left everything on the field\nin a fair match. We shouldn't be so disheartened.
We have to accept the loss, however.
Let's go congratulate Japan,\nand be proud to have played against them.
Zut... What else is there to do?\nIt's no time to forget one's etiquette.
You? Etiquette?
Oh, just cram it already!
Misaki.
Pierre.
Just let me say... Congratulations.
Thanks.
I lost to you one-on-one and with my team,\nas well.
Misaki, that last gambit you pulled...\nIt was amazing.
All that was going through my head was\nthe fact that I wanted to play\nwith this team just a little bit longer.
Heh, I see...
I admit my defeat, today.\nBut this is only the beginning of our rivalry.
Someday, somehow, I will return to challenge\nyou again. Think you'll be up for it?
Anytime, Pierre. I look forward to that day\nwe can meet on the field once more.
Now that you've made it,\nyou'd better win the finals, too.
That's the plan.
Congratulations, Misaki.\nI hate to admit it, but I lost today.
Pierre...
Thank you.
Honestly, though, I see it a bit differently.
One-on-one face-offs are a part of a team effort.
I may have lost today, but this is\nonly the beginning of our rivalry.
As long as the both of us keep playing,\nwe'll be sure to meet again on the field.
Someday, somehow, I will return to challenge\nyou again. Think you'll be up for it?
Of course! I look forward to that day.
Heh. Same here.
You're in the finals. You better win.
Thanks. We'll do our best. For you and us.
I can't believe I let you pull off a\ncounter-attack. You're really something else.
I just gave it my all. But I suppose\nhaving a teammate believe in me pushed me\nto be better, too.
When you say teammate,\ndo you mean that guy who gave you the assist?
Yeah. He's the captain of my school's team.
So your captain put his faith in you.
Your feet definitely rank among the fastest\nin the world. Don't forget to exploit\nthat in the finals, too.
I won't forget. Thanks.
You had us worried there, Soda. I think my heart\nskipped a beat when you got that yellow card.
You couldn't see it,\nbut I was in a cold sweat myself.
I do play on the edge when it comes to roughness,\nbut that's definitely no excuse\nif I get booted from the game.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
What now? You wanna have another go?
No, nothing like that.
You're the first person to play such\ntight defense after taking a hit from me.\nI wanted to acknowledge that.
Hmph. If you're calling me tough,\nI'll take it as a compliment. I am the Ace Killer.
Should we play again,\nI'll be sure to have my eye out for you...\nAt least, if you're still the ace striker.
Heh... You may be persistent, but that's about\nit. I won't let you guard me so tightly next time.
What do you mean by "that's about it"?!
I mean that defense that gets you carded is\nproof you've got no technique. Am I wrong?
Did come here to pick a fight?\nSounds to me like someone's a sore loser.
S-Soda! Cool it!
If it's a fight you want, I'd be happy to oblige!
Bring it on, punk!
Cut it out!
...
...
I guess it'd be uncouth to\nbreak into a fight here.
If you want to settle this later,\nwe'll do it on the field.
I look forward to seeing you\non the pitch again, Napoleon.
I'll be the ace killer that\nperforms your last rites!
You took the words right out of my mouth.\nTake your rusty razor and\nbe sure to polish it up before then!
Later!
Why I oughta...!
I thought I knew everything about you,\nbut I never expected you to be this talented.
France will be contending for the World Cup\nin the future, and I think\nI just found a new rival today. You.
I know Japan has Misaki and Tsubasa, but I never\nknew they had another player of the same caliber.
I consider myself one of the best all-rounders\nthere is, but you definitely put on a show, too.
Be sure to keep up the momentum\ngoing into the finals.
I can't believe I lost in a battle of scoring.\nThis feels like a nightmare.
I guess this is just a testament\nto how good my coach is.
I'll be sure to remember your face.
Listen here.\nYou better score in the finals, too, or else!
I never imagined I could lose\nin a one-on-one confrontation on the field.
You never seemed like the type during practice,\nbut you're really strong when\nit comes to the real thing.
That's something I totally missed out on.\nSeems I've got more to learn.
You just may be as strong as I am.
When France competes for the World Cup again,\nyou'll be a force to be reckoned with.
Today is my loss. But just you wait.\nI won't lose next time!
Au revoir!
Yeah.
Pierre... What an amazing player.
It doesn't matter that I'm the captain...\nI've got a lot I could learn from him.
Agreed. That's what makes him quite the rival.
But now I can keep playing soccer with everyone.
Heck yeah! Let's soak it in while we can!
It would be awesome to win this tournament.\nThat's a memory one keeps for life.
You bet!
The Day the Junior Youth World Challenge\nis Set to Commence
The day's finally arrived, folks!
This is the start of the new international\ntournament that will determine the world's finest\nyoung players, the Junior Youth World Challenge!
The world was shocked when the French\nInternational was cancelled.
But amidst that shock came the announcement of\nthe World Challenge! And what could be a more\nappropriate title with all these amazing teams?
Just listen to these cheers!
The USA put its sports lineage on the line when\nthey built the state-of-the-art Star Crown\nStadium, but the crowd is enormous!
And it's not just American fans either, a\nworldwide audience has come to witness the\ncrowning of our new heroes!
And here come the players!
First up from South America is the Argentina team!
And their captain, Juan Diaz! Rumor has it that\neven in Argentina he's a once-in-a-generation\ntalent!
What sort of miracle plays can we hope to see\nfrom him? I, for one, can't wait to find out!
And our next country is a long-time fan favorite:\nthe kings of soccer, Brazil!
While they weren't invited to the French\nInternational, they're here today!
Every one of their players bears remarkable\ntalented, but stand out among them is Carlos\nBara!
He wears Brazil's legendary number 10 jersey,\ndisplaying the high regard for his skill!
And next up is France!
While they lost the chance to play in their\nhomeland when the French International was\ncanceled, they've turned out today.
To deal with that frustration, the players\nunderwent special training just for this!
Leading the team is the powerhouse\nalso selected for last year's youth\nrepresentatives, Elle Sid Pierre!
He specializes in artistic soccer.\nWhat will he put on display today?
Next up is Germany!
Their captain is Germany's Young Emperor,\nKarl Heinz Schneider!
But that's not all! Their line-up also includes\nSchester, Kaltz, Margus, and Heine! What a\nfearsome team!
After the crushing defeat they handed Japan in\ntheir scrimmage, they've become favorites to win!
Here comes Italy, who will play\nJapan in their opening match!
Their goalie this time is Zino Hernandez, a\nmarvelous player who hasn't given up a goal in\nover a year, including the scrimmages!
Known as the "Perfect Keeper," does Japan even\nstand a chance of scoring against him today?!
But let's not forget the rising star of Italian\nsoccer offense, Leonardo Rusciano!
And finally, it's our boys from Japan!
Look at that crowd...
What a huge stadium...
And the cheers...
It's finally happening.
In August, we witnessed the fierce competition at\nNationals, followed by the Junior Hero League to\ndetermine who would represent Japan.
Then they were joined by Wakabayashi, who'd won\nthe elementary school Nationals with Nankatsu SC,\nbut has been playing in Germany recently.
Along with his fellow Nankatsu SC veteran Misaki,\nwho had moved to France for his father's work.
This has given our All-Japan team\nan incredible array of talent!
And we could never forget Japan's ace,\nTsubasa Ozora!
Just how far the soccer prodigy's talents will\ntake him against this host of experienced players\nfrom around the world remains to be seen!
(It's finally time. Time to test our skills and\ntake the first step toward our dream of a World\nCup victory for Japan!)
And here are the Netherlands!
Bearing number 14 is their\nace, Brian Kluivoort!
Known as one of the leading forwards in Europe,\nhe'll be taking his ultra-aggressive playstyle and\naiming for the top!
And here comes Senegal!
Africa's heroes, Senegal! In terms of raw\nphysical ability, they're widely viewed as\nthe best in the tournament!
Making expert use of their natural height and\nspeed, will they become a storm that sweeps over\nthis tournament?
And now we're hearing the loudest cheers\nof all for the home team, America!
Their players have tempered themselves with\nstate-of-the-art, scientific training methods!
But will this new, scientific soccer\ndeliver them the championship?
And that wraps up all the competing countries!
As soon as the opening ceremonies finish,\nwe'll begin the first match for day one:
Japan versus Italy!
Okay, listen up guys!
This is for real now.\nThe Junior Youth World Challenge has started.
I want you to do your best out there and\nput to use every ounce of your training.
Yes, Coach!





All right.
Now, it's time to talk about\nyour match with Italy.
You all saw the scrimmage. Italy boasts a world\nclass defense. They call it "catenaccio," meaning\n"door-bolt." It's also called "the chain."
Hernandez is particularly skilled. He's earned\nhis "Perfect Keeper" moniker by not letting\na single shot into the goal for over a year.
...
So our only hope of scoring on him is to pin down\nthe midfield and keep hammering shots at the net\nuntil he breaks.
Yessir!







Which means we're counting on you,\nTsubasa and Hyuga.
Racja!


This doesn't mean we don't have to consider their\noffense. They'll use their strong defense to get\nthe ball and counter.
And the key to that strategy is their forward,\nRusciano.
His strength and skill combine to make\nhim a tough player to pin down.
But after analyzing the scrimmage,\nwe noticed something huge.
He never passes, and his teammates hardly ever\npass to him either. In other words, he's a lone\nwolf.
So as a countermeasure, I want everyone\nto stick to him whenever he has the ball.
But when he doesn't, you don't need to mark him\nclosely. Just watch out for the rebounds!
Okay!






Now, you can't ignore the other players\neither, of course. Make sure not to get\nfrazzled by their quick passes.
You guys should be used to world-class moves by\nnow, so just stay calm and you'll be fine.
Alright Tsubasa, it's time for\nthe captain to rally the troops!
Roger that.
Okay guys, if we want to make it through the\npreliminary block, we need to beat Italy!
Tak!







We're representing all of Japanese\nsoccer here! Put your hearts into it!
Tak! Let's prove our strength to the world!
It's finally time for the real tournament, boys.
We've been training and training for this,\never since the games in France were cancelled.
If we unite our strengths, there's no way we can\nlose. We'll show them that Italy's the best in the\nworld!
For sure!



Tch. "Unite our strengths"? Bo-ring!
Wh-What was that, Rusciano?!
The kiddies can go play buddy-buddy\nwith each other. I'll do things my way.
Just try not to slow me down, you hear? This\ntournament will be my stepping stone to the big\ntime.
Who does that guy think he is?\nWe're representing all of Italy here!
...
It's finally time, folks!\nThe Junior Youth World Challenge starts here!
And the opening match is Japan against Italy!
Italy, with their blue uniforms affectionately\ncalled Azzurri, and Japan, in mostly white\nuniforms, are taking the field!
With the opening procession over, the other\nteams are watching from the stands!
Can Japan's Golden Generation led by Tsubasa put\nup a respectable fight against the powerful Italy,\nwho is one of the favorites to win?
We'll find out soon because it's\nalmost time for the kickoff!
Let's have a good match.
Right, same to you.
I'll stop every last one of your\nshots this match. I'll stake my\ntitle as the perfect keeper on it.
Well, that won't do. You'll definitely hear the\nball hitting that net behind you today.
Will you two shut up already so we can start?
(That goalie is so confident...\nJust talking to him made me feel tense.)
(And I'm sure Italy's going to be playing even\nharder than we saw in the scrimmage.)
(Darn it! I'm Europe's number one goalie!)
(Zino Hernandez... Things may've ended in a draw\na year ago, but this time I'm taking you down!)
(The coach left this important first\nmatch to me, not to Wakabayashi.)
(And I'm not letting him down!\nBring it on, Italy!)
(No way! I can't believe Wakabayashi and\nWakashimazu were both passed over for me!)
(No, I can't think like that. I'm a good player.\nI can't let this pressure get to me.)
(All I can do is play my own way, and protect the\nlead Tsubasa and Hyuga will take for us!)
(Finally, the moment of truth...)
(The Golden Generation... Our team has talent\nin spades, not the least of which Tsubasa Ozora.)
(And the first battle of these warriors to try and\nbring home the World Cup for Japan.)
(What an unimaginably huge dream.\nBut today, they take that first step!)
Here we come, Italy!
We're winning, even if it\nmeans taking on the world!
Alright guys, let's set the\npace.
Like I need you to tell me\nthat!
Just let me do what I need to.
Alright! I got him!
This guy... can keep up with\nme?!
You're just a stepping stone!
See what hardcore training\ndoes!
Who does this guy think he is?
Outta my way, trash!
I lost to this kid?!
Pretty cheeky, brat!
No one's interested in you,\nwannabe!
Hernandez's hands find the ball and\nhe throws it back down field.
Hyah!
Huh?
Wh-What's this?! He threw\nthe ball straight to Tsubasa!
(No way... Was that on purpose?)
(C'mon, you got your chance now.\nShow me that Drive Shot!)
(I knew it. He's taunting me!)
Fine, if you want it so bad!
If you think you can stop my\nDrive Shot, then be my guest!
Tsubasa takes a shot! It's the Drive Shot!
H-How...?!
My word! Hernandez has caught Tsubasa's\npowerful Drive Shot with just one hand!
This must be what it means to be\nEurope's number one keeper!
(Not a bad shot, really. Not so long\nago I doubt I would've be able to\ncatch it even with both hands.)
(But I've been building up this right arm ever\nsince the French International was canceled.)
(I owe Karl Heinz Schneider payback for\nthat goal he took off me a year ago.)
(Just as I thought, he's the genuine article.)
(But I'm not giving up yet, Hernandez!)
Remember this feeling, you wannabe!
An amazing shot from Rusciano!
What power! A true demonstration of\nthe might of a world-class forward!
Th-That's crazy...
I thought Schneider was good, but this\nguy would give him a run for his money.
So this is world-class soccer?
(That was nuts. We can't let ourselves\nforget the world's a big place.)
(But I'm not about to lose to you!)
(I rebuilt myself from the ground up.\nAnd this match I'll prove it!)
Get off my tail!
You guys are starting \nto get on my nerves!
And once again Rusciano is being\nheavily marked by Japan's defense!
I've just about had it with you guys!
Oops, Rusciano just sent a\ndefender flying with his arm!
That's a yellow card!
A yellow card for that? Are you kidding me?!
What's this? Rusciano looks furious,\nand he's approaching the referee!
Captain Hernandez hurries to intercede!
Cut it, Rusciano!\nDo you wanna get kicked off the field?
Fine! I got my eyes on you!
And Rusciano scores!
Amazing! Rusciano is carrying the Italian attack\nall by himself! He's certainly living up to the\nhype!
You get it? This is MY soccer!
(And now, Japan is going to\nhave to press the offensive.)
(But the harder they push offense,\nthe easier it is for us to counter.)
(That's our winning formula.)
And there's the whistle to end the first half!
What a shocking development! Japan has managed\nto take the lead against Italy, who boast the\nstrongest defense in the tournament!
Their fierce fight is bringing cheers and\napplause even from the player stands!
And there's the whistle to end the first half!
Despite being the favorites to win\nthe tournament, Italy hasn't managed\nto make Japan budge an inch!
Their fierce fight is bringing cheers and\napplause even from the player stands!
Great work out there, All-Japan Junior Youth!
You're putting up a great fight against Italy!
What an upset it'll be if you win!\nNo one would see it coming!
Keep it up in the second half!
The cheers are nice and all, but they could act a\nlittle less surprised that we know how to play.
Yeah, no kiddin'.
I guess that's just how Japan\nlooks to the rest of the world.
Guess so.
And we'll be the ones to change that!
Well, we WERE a bit low-level BEFORE.
Then let's not let them down in the second half!
That's the spirit.
In soccer, skill is everything. The only\nway to make them acknowledge us is\nto show 'em what we really got.
That was my attitude back in Hamburg, too!
Heh. And here we are.
Yeah... and we've grown so much!
You know it! So we just keep doing what\nwe're doing and the applause will pour in!
You're both cheery.
And what's wrong with that? It's reassuring\nwhen the crowd's on our side!
Like a homefield advantage, right?
But the other team's definitely\nnot thinking that way.
You're probably right.
And there's the whistle to end the first half!
Japan's let Italy get quite a lead. This was to\nbe expected from one of the favorites to win.
But the game's not over yet! Japan can still make\na triumphant comeback in the second half!
...
Tsubasa...
(That man! Is that...?)
Nice hustle, everyone. You've come a long way.
If we could fight that hard in the first\nhalf, then we're set for the second!
Tak!
We just get better and better!
But don't lose focus.
Misaki's right. We're up against a favorite to\nwin. They're bound to have some tricks up their\nsleeves.
Alright, then get your game\nfaces on and get ready to go!
Right on!




(My legs are definitely getting stronger.\nI even scored against that goalie.)
(This may be the time for me to\ntake my game to the next level!)
(Guess that Hernandez guy's got the\nskills to back up his hype train.)
(If I'm gonna get a goal on him,\nI've gotta use that technique!)
(Plus, if I wanna compete on the world\nstage... I gotta keep up with Rusciano, too!)
Tsubasa, I want to talk about our\nstrategy for the second half.
What about it?
If, and this is just if, Italy gets a lead in the\nsecond half, they'll probably try to lock down\ntheir side of the field.
And if that happens, it'll be hard to\nbreak their line with just a few people.
So should that happen, perhaps our best\nbet is for the whole team to lead a charge.
I mean, this is just hypothetical, but... I just\nfelt like maybe we should be thinking ahead.
True. While I hope it doesn't come to that,\nwe do have that option if we need it, huh?
Okay, I got it. You give the order\nwhen the time comes, Takeshi.
And I'll lead the charge into Italy's defenses!
(But that really is an all-or-nothing strategy.\nWithout a good eye on the flow of the match, we\ncould just screw it up and eat a counterattack.)
(If only a playmaker with a lot of\nexperience like Takeshi were on\nthe field, I'd leave it to him...)
Gah, we lost the lead...
This is a tough spot to be in against\na defense savvy opponent.
Yeah, we gotta catch up ASAP.
It's time to really bring the game to\nthem, but don't lose your cool.
Misaki's right. If we lose our heads, we'll be\nright where they want us. They'll be hunting\nfor a counterattack opportunity, after all.
Couldn't we also just go all out\nand charge into their formation?
What?
I mean, if we'll be in a tough spot after they\ntighten up their defenses anyway...
Yeah, but that's pretty risky.
Still, if it comes down to it, what else can we\ndo? Better than sitting back and losing.
You're right. We hafta use the time we\nhave doing everything we can to win!
Nothing's gonna stop us!




(I managed to get a goal with my Tiger Shot,\nbut I don't know if I could get another one\npast that keeper.)
(Even if it basically wrecks me, I'm gonna hafta\nuse that new shot! It's now or never!)
(Guess that Hernandez guy's got the\nskills to back up his hype train.)
(If I'm gonna take a point from him,\nI've gotta use that technique.)
(It'll probably wear me out a bit, but I can't\nbe playing at 80% when we're losing!)
(Plus, if I wanna compete on the world\nstage... I gotta keep up with Rusciano, too!)
Tsubasa, I want to talk about our\nstrategy for the second half.
What about it?
To maintain the difference in score, Italy will\nprobably just lock down their side of the field.
And if that happens, it'll be hard to\nbreak their line with just a few people.
So should that happen, perhaps our best\nbet is for the whole team to lead a charge.
True, if they cluster up, then even with my\ndribble it'll be tough to break through on my own.
I hope we can take the lead before it comes to\nthat, but if we need to... It's risky, but we may\nhave no other choice.
Okay, I got it. You give the order\nwhen the time comes, Takeshi.
And I'll lead the charge into Italy's defenses!
Tsubasa...
Racja!
(But that really is an all-or-nothing strategy.\nWithout a careful eye on the flow of the match,\nwe'll eat a counter and the point gap will widen.)
(If only a playmaker with a lot of\nexperience like Takeshi were on\nthe field, I'd leave it to him...)
Hey, Rusciano! I've had enough of this playing\nlike you aren't on a team nonsense!
Get off my back!
"Try not to slow me down," huh? Yeah, right!\nIt's like we're playing a man down here!
What are you whinging about?
I've been scoring all on my own!\nIt's your fault you suck.
What was that?!
You think I don't wanna win this? If the team\ndoesn't win, there goes my big contract! Quit\nwasting my time!
So stay outta my way!
Rusciano...!
How is it my fault that they scored on us anyway?
I'm listening, Mr. "Perfect Keeper"!\nTell me how it's not your fault they scored.
...I won't deny that that's my fault.\nAnd there's no excuse for it.
Ooh, well aren't you honest? Guess you got that\nluxury already being signed onto a good team!\nMaybe I should get right on that, huh?!
Don't speak to Zino like that!
Drop it, Tardelli.
But, Zino...
Rusciano.
What? If it's another lecture from the perfect\nZino Hernandez, I don't wanna hear it.
I think it's fine if you want\nto win for your own sake.
Eh?!
As long as the team wins, we'll\ngladly be your stepping stone.
...
But Japan's much better than we anticipated.
You must have realized that too, after being\nso heavily marked for the entire first half.
...
So how do you think we should turn this around?\nWhat's the best way to win from our position?
Someone like you, who crawled his way up from a\nsmall rural team to become a national rep, should\nalready know the answer.
...
I want to win. So I'm going\nto keep passing to you.
I want you to play however you think is best.
I'm trusting you, Rusciano.
Zino, you...
Hey, Rusciano! I've had enough of this playing\nlike you aren't on a team nonsense!
Get off my back! It's not like we're\nlosing, so what's the problem?
That's not the point! With you\nalways going off on your own, it's\nlike we're playing a man down here!
Do you even realize what we've been through?
So what?
I've been scoring all on my own!\nIt's your fault you suck.
What was that?!
I said I'd win for you, so if you ain't got the\nbite to back up that bark, stop yapping!
Rusciano...!
Could you stop it you two? We're teammates,\nwe shouldn't be fighting each other!
Ooh, just what I'd expect from the perfect\nZino Hernandez, who's already signed his\ncushy contract. Maybe I should focus on that!
The heck's your problem?
Let me handle this, Tardelli.
But, Zino...
Rusciano. You said you'd "win for us."
Yeah, so?
Sure, we're relying on you to score points.
But who do you think has to keep Japan\nfrom catching up on the scoreboard?
...
You can't win in soccer on your own. You start\nwinning when the entire teams attacks and defends.
...So what's your point?
Nothing, really. I just wanted to\nmake sure you knew that.
But it's not just Rusciano!\nWhat about the rest of you?
Why won't you pass to Rusciano? Why\nwon't you help him score more points?!
If it's just because he rubs you the wrong way,\nthen you're as bad a team player as he is!
...
Now personally, I want to win.\nSo I'll gladly pass to Rusciano.
I want you all to think about what we should be\ndoing to win, and only that, in the second half.
Y-Yeah!



Rusciano, you crawled all the way up from\na small rural team to become a national rep.
You should know the best way to play,\nand what we need to do to win.
So I trust you.
Zino, you...
Halftime is over, and we're\nwaiting for the whistle!
For Japan to hold a lead against Italy... are we\nlooking at a dark horse victory in the works?
Halftime is over, and we're\nwaiting for the whistle!
Who will come out ahead in the\nsecond half? Japan or Italy?!
Halftime is over, and we're\nwaiting for the whistle!
Just how far will Japan be able to push Italy's\nseemingly impenetrable defense in the second half?
Let's hope Tsubasa and his\nteam can maintain that tenacity!
What we need to do to win, huh...?
Hey, Rusciano!
...What?
The ball's going to be coming your way,\nso you'd better win for us, alright?
We'll use whatever we\nhave if it'll help Italy win!
...
So you trust me... Zino?
You really are an idiot.
What's this? Something's different about Italy after halftime!
Looks like the team's backing up Rusciano now!
Their playstyle has changed?
Watch out, guys!
And Rusciano scores!
What a surprise! Not only did they completely\nchange their playstyle in the opening minutes,\nthey secured an early goal!
That's what you wanted, right?
Okay, hold onto this lead!
Italy is tightening their defenses!
This is their famous strategy! Catenaccio!
Looks like Hyuga is driving deep!
(I hope you're watching me, Coach Kira.)
(This is my new shot, perfected\nusing that black ball you sent me.)
(Bring it on! My Golden Right\nHand can stop any shot!)
(I don't care if you're the best goalie in\nEurope, this shot is gonna bury you!)
Eat this! Neo Tiger Shot!
I-It went in!
Thwarting Hernandez' Golden Right Hand,\nHyuga's shot has hit the back of the net!
I did it... I really did it!
Alright, way to go, Hyuga!
You're amazing, Hyuga!
Hyuga!
Tsubasa...
I found it.
Huh?
Up until now, and especially these last three\nyears, you've been my target, Tsubasa.\nI played soccer just to beat YOU.
But I just found my new goal for the future.\nSomething bigger, something better.\nSomething like what you have.
Hyuga...
I...
I want striker number nine to mean the world's\nbest! I wanna be the best striker in the world!
(What a powerful shot!)
(If not for my golden arm, that would\nhave definitely shattered a bone!)
Now, Tsubasa!
Chaaarge!
They did it! The All-Japan team did it!
At Tsubasa's command, the entire team\ncharged into enemy lines and vaporized\nItaly's catenaccio defense!
Truly... Truly what a hard-earned goal!
We did it, Tsubasa!
This is all because you know tactics,\nand you had a plan, Takeshi!
No way... This can't be happening...
So you gave up on your individual skills and just\nrushed us like a mob?! You have the nerve to call\nTHAT soccer?!
And there's the final whistle!
The All-Japan Junior Youths have won\ntheir first international match! Outstanding!
Not to mention the huge upset it represents, as\nthey've turned the tables on the traditionally\nstrong Italy!
And there's the final whistle!
The All-Japan Junior Youths have ended\ntheir first international match in a draw!
While that's quite an achievement, given\nthat they were up against the traditionally\nstrong soccer country of Italy...
It might be difficult for them to break\nthrough the preliminaries like this.
And there's the final whistle!
The All-Japan Junior Youths have ended\ntheir first international match with a loss...
It seems the defense of the traditionally\nstrong Italy was just a bridge too far.
It'll be difficult for them to come out on top in\nthe preliminaries after such a rough start.
We...We did it!
High five, Tsubasa!
We won! We really won!
And against Italy! We beat Italy!
The championship ain't out of reach either then!
Tak! Compared to when we first got here...
We're completely different now!
You got that right. Compared to the Japan we saw\nin the scrimmage match, I would swear you were a\ndifferent team.
Hernandez...
It's our loss. Color me impressed\nwith Japanese soccer.
And Hyuga! Your shot really took me by surprise!\nI don't remember the last time I saw such power.
Same to you. I don't think I've ever\nfaced a goalie with your talents.
We'll need to change how we look at Japan.
Glad to hear it.
Still, it took a lot of guts to go\nfor an all-out surge like that.
If you'd screwed it up, that would've been the\nperfect opportunity for us to counterattack.
We knew that, but if we hadn't gone all in we\nnever would've broken your catenaccio chain.
You're always going to have to take risks to win.
Interesting... Despite this\nfriendly, level-headed charade,\nyou're quite the gambler.
Well, time to get going. Ciao!
Yeah, catch you later!
(The Italy Junior Youths were amazing,\nespecially Zino Hernandez and Leonardo Rusciano.)
(They're both opponents we never would've\nmet if we weren't here on the world stage.)
Hey Tsubasa! Let's go say thanks to all\nthe folks cheering us from the stands!
Okay!
But <avatar_name>, your shot back there showed\nsignificant improvement from when we were\npracticing.
I'll admit defeat for today. But next\ntime I'll show you a total shutout!
You surprised me the most, <avatar_name>.
I never imagined anyone would be\nable to score so many goals on me.
But I won't lose next time! I'll be ready.
Well, time to get going. Ciao!
Yeah, catch you later!
(The Italy Junior Youths were amazing,\nespecially Zino Hernandez and Leonardo Rusciano.)
(They're both strong opponents we never would've\nmet if we weren't here on the world stage.)
Hey Tsubasa! Let's go say thanks to all\nthe folks cheering us from the stands!
Okay!
...
Don't you dare lose. Cuz I can only\naccept having lost to the best.
Don't you forget that.
I'm sure that's just his way of\nsaying he thinks you're good.
I wouldn't take it personally. He's just\nnot used to saying nice things to people.
...
I'll remember you.
I'm sure that's just his way of\nsaying he thinks you're good.
I wouldn't take it personally. He's just\nnot used to saying nice things to people.
Well, time to get going. Ciao!
Yeah, catch you later!
(The Italy Junior Youths were amazing,\nespecially Zino Hernandez and Leonardo Rusciano.)
(They're both strong opponents we never would've\nmet if we weren't here on the world stage.)
Hey Tsubasa! Let's go say thanks to all\nthe folks cheering us from the stands!
Okay!
Sorry guys, this loss was my\nfault. I let them score on us.
I still can't believe it! How could we lose?
Yeah, we've still got a long way to go.
What's this? Did you send\ninvitations for the pity party?
What was that?!
We can still make it past the preliminaries\nwith two more wins, can't we?
If you have time to feel sorry for\nyourselves, try spending some of\nit preparing for the next match, instead.
...What's with him?
(Rusciano...)
(You did it, Tsubasa...)
Roberto.
Hmm?
So you're the famous Roberto Hongo.
...
Tsubasa won a magnificent victory with Japan.
...
So how was it? How did you\nfeel about Tsubasa's play?
Even after you left Japan, he treasured the notes\nyou left him, and developed his own style.
And he polished those skills. The Drive Shot he\nshowed us today was a good one, don't you think?
But more than that... He inherited every little\nthing about his playstyle from you, Roberto.
...
How about it? You could go see\nhim on the bench right now.
I think you've got the wrong guy.
Huh?
I don't know any Roberto.
You must be mistaken.
Oh!
I'm not Roberto.
(Roberto...)
(We may have won today's match, but my Drive Shot\nwas completely useless against Hernandez.)
(We may have won today's match, but Hernandez\nproved my Drive Shot can be stopped.)
(Azwan from the American team also stopped\nit like it was nothing. Is it just not good enough\nfor this level of play?)
(But Hyuga was stopped by him, too, and he managed\nto bounce back and put in his Neo Tiger Shot.)
(Come to think of it, wasn't Hyuga stopped by him\ntoo? And ever since then, he's been doing special\ntraining to develop new shot.)
(I need to keep up!)
(If I want to be the game-making, goal-scoring\nmidfielder I know I can be, I need a better Drive\nShot!)
Junior Youth World Challenge Preliminaries,\nBlock A, Second Match,\nNetherlands vs. Senegal
Hey, those Dutch guys are pretty good.
That's to be expected.
Italy's a defensive team and the Netherlands are\npredominantly offensive in their approach.
The guy you've gotta watch out for\nis Brian Kluivoort, in the 14 jersey.
His big bro Stijn was a powerhouse for the\nNetherlands a few years back in the World Youth\ncircuit. Brian's a real star forward in Europe.
Good lookin' out, Misugi.
The legendary players the Netherlands were\nfielding inspired me to get into the game myself,\nso I couldn't help but notice.
I still like to keep track of what\nthey're up to on the pitch.
Alright, huddle up.
Heh, sorry it was a bit selfish of me.
I just had to have the Kluivoort number.\nI was just such a big fan.
We face the Netherlands today. They boast one of\nthe fiercest offenses in this tournament. They're\nnot going to be anything like Italy was.
(That's kinda cool, Misugi. You had your hero\njust like how I had Roberto from Brazil. That's\nwhy I took the number 10.)
Hey! It's almost game time, guys.
And there's the kickoff for the second\npreliminary match with the Netherlands\nfacing off against Senegal.
Senegal's midfielder and captain, Ismail Senghor,\ntakes possession. I can tell we've got an intense\nmatch ahead of us, folks!
Whoa, and there goes Senghor blasting\na shot through the Dutch lines!
And Senegal forward Moussa Malick Diallo punches\nthrough the Dutch lines with lightning speed!
And Senegal has done it! They take the first\npoint with astonishing speed and precision!
Diallo's lofty header sends\nCaptain Senghor's long ball hurtling\ninto the Dutch net with a satisfying swish!
The duo has leveraged their superior\nphysicality for a classic Senegalese attack!
Check out that forward, that guy can really move\nacross the field! Bet he'd even give Nitta a run\nfor his money.
Whoa, Senegal already got a goal!
Just wait... This'll get the Dutch team fired up.
Huh?
Take a real good look at them out there.
They don't even look the least bit fazed,\nand they just gave up a goal!
That's right. They know they can come back\nand get as many goals as they need to win.
And there's the whistle! The match is over!
Facing off against Senegal, the Dutch team comes\naway with its highest-scoring win ever!
Despite giving up an early goal, the Netherlands,\nled by ace forward Kluivoort, delivered an\nunending assault on the Senegalese team!
And despite their physical prowess and mastery of\nthe long ball to quickly gobble up space...
...the Senegalese were pinned down in the\nmidfield by Klismann, keeping the ball away from\ntheir ace Senghor and effectively out of the game.
Hard running in the first half had the Senegalese\nworn out at halftime, letting the Netherlands\nrepeatedly take advantage of their exhausted foes!
W-Wow!
So that's the Dutch offense. I can't believe\nhow smooth their teamwork is.
And that was only the first match!\nThey're probably still shaking off a bit of rust.
Guess that means I'm gonna see some\neven tighter teamwork from their forwards then.
Yeah, we'll be on the pitch across from them soon.
Don't worry, Takeshi!
It is all a bit troubling...
Wonder who we'll have in the goal...
Huh?
Listen to <avatar_name>, Takeshi!
We're better now, we're stronger now.\nKeep the faith!
Uh, yeah! Okay!
Whut ya' frettin' about? All of us came\nto take on the world, an' that's the world!\nWouldn' be fun if it were easy.
That's right. Time to gather data,\nplan, and strike with resolve!
Maybe Morisaki'll be put in.\nI wonder how many goals he'll give up...
What now...?!
Oh, sorry, man! I didn't know you were there.
You know, I've been workin' my butt\noff gettin' ready for my turn. I'm ready.
...
Alright, everybody. Italy was tough, but the\nNetherlands is looking plenty formidable, too.
So let's keep stoking the fire from today,\nand blaze across the pitch tomorrow!
Tak!





Preliminaries, Block B, France vs. England
Yo Misaki, have you gotten a look\nat the France Junior Youth team?
Have I gotten a look? Actually, I have\na little experience taking them on.
Wha?!
You took 'em on? But I didn't think\nyou were on a team back then.
Exactly. I didn't know if I was any good, so I\nshowed up at their national rep dorms and\nchallenged them to a match to find out.
...That's a bit much, isn't it?
Hey, if I hadn't done that I wouldn't have\nfound the confidence to be All-Japan.
So who's the big dog to watch?\nIt's gotta be Pierre, right?
Elle Sid Pierre, no doubt.\nHis techniques are the real deal.
Both times I faced him one-on-one\nI just couldn't break through.
He even managed to stop you, Misaki?!
It's not just him to watch out for, though...\nLooks like it's about to get started.
Here we are, folks! Almost twenty\nminutes into the first half, France is\ndominating the tempo out on the pitch!
Their captain, Elle Sid Pierre, succeeds once\nagain in penetrating the English backfield!
What flash, what technique, what poetry! Pierre\nslips and slides past the legs of each of the\nEnglish defenders! No one can match him!
Pierre nails a marvelous through pass straight to\nLouis Napoleon, who is already in position and on\nthe move! What marvelous team coordination!
Goooal! France puts in another one!
Napoleon's expert swerve shot blasts the ball\nright past the keeper and into the English goal!
That's Louis Napoleon. He's a hot-head and a\ntroublemaker, but... Well, you just saw what he's\ncapable of.
And now for England's counter-offensive! Their\nplayers sweep left and right as they sail down the\nfield, rattling the French defense!
Here's the cross from the left\nside over to English forward Dean,\nwaiting in prime scoring position...
But wait! A French player reaches out with a\nbrilliant tackle, seizing the ball and dashing\nDean's hopes!
What a great play by the French defender, Jean!
That Jean guy's really somethin', ain't he?
Misaki, who's that?
Sorry, I don't really know him that well.
He's apparently new. Got in during the selection\nthey ran after the French International was\ncancelled.
And that's the match!
France holds England at bay and claims\na victory in their opening match!
Pierre holds the midfield, as Napoleon strikes\nat the English goal, while Jean in the\nbackfield cuts off any would-be trespassers!
I think you'll agree with me that this was\ntruly a masterful performance to take in!
Man, France is pretty tough...\nNot that I'm surprised.
Pierre's really good!
That Napoleon packs quite a punch.
He's not flashy but Jean's\nreally got something.
He really was something, wasn't he?\nYou can see how he'd be able to shut Misaki down.
I've heard that Pierre's even impressed the older\nboys, and that he's pretty much guaranteed to make\nthe French national team as an adult.
He's that good, huh...
Mmm, you've gotta watch out for that kid.\nThe curl he puts on that ball... That's one\nthat'd take two hands to bring down.
So I've got to really go in if I want to\ncatch it, or I'm going to have to sock that\nthing hard to keep it out of the goal.
And don't forget to plant those legs!\nDon't want to get knocked over...
His defense was extremely effective. With the\nbackfield secure, France's midfielders and\nforwards had plenty of space to work with.
Jean just might be the linchpin that makes\nthe French battle plan possible.
Man, it's crazy out in the world!\nThere are skilled guys in every country!
(Pierre...)
Misaki...
(Misaki, France will make the finals.\nYou can be sure of that.)
(Fight, win, and make it to the finals...\nBecause we've got a score to settle, don't we?)
All-Japan Junior Youth Team Training
Keep a close eye on their\ncaptain, Brian Kluivoort.
Yes, Coach!





Let's go, <avatar_name>!
Okay, let 'er rip!
Hyah!
Sweet punch, Wakashimazu!
Wakashimazu, you're slacking!\nYou could've gotten both hands on that ball.\nGrit your teeth and get in there!
What'd you say?!
And you, Soda! What're you doing giving up\nso much space? Think a little! Don't let them\nget an opening!
Wha-?!
And the rest of you, pick up the pace!\nJust because we beat Italy doesn't mean\nyou can ease up!
You all think we can win a tournament just\nbumblin' around?
Say what?
Oh, Wakabayashi...
Yo, Wakabayashi!
You're gonna shoot yer' mouth off while\nI'm out here giving it all I got?
H-Hey, ease up, Soda!
Soda messed up.
Wakabayashi was in the wrong.
Save it for the other team!
You, too...?
Soda, how're you gonna miss something\neven a first-year can see?
Hmph...
You know, you've actually done\nreally well reading my positioning\nsignals. Been studying the tactics?
We'd have a much easier time out there\nif we had more guys like you.
<avatar_name>'s right, guys!\nWe can't play if we're too busy\nfighting each other.
Yeah, sure...
Racja! Okay guys, let's get back to practice!
<avatar_name>...
Wh-What'd you say?!
Be more specific and less angry.
We're not like you, Wakabayashi.
It kinda sucks to just get yelled at.
Well, you got some nerve.
What do ya mean, "not like you"?
It "sucks"?!
Wakabayashi, I'm with\n<avatar_name> on this one.
Matsuyama...
You're the goalkeeper on a top-tier German team,\nwe know the guys you play with are hardcore.
Maybe you can talk to them like that, but I'm\nsorry, we just don't have the knowledge and\nexperience.
...
I guess we're just not on your level.\nMust look that way from your perspective.
So it kinda sucks if you're gonna beat us\nover the head with it even though\nwe just played our hardest.
...
Wakabayashi, I... It's like Matsuyama says.
We just don't know how to do\nwhat you want us to do.
...
O-Okay guys, let's get back to practice!
Practicing all alone, at this hour?\nThat's commitment.
And you are?
Please don't interrupt my training.
For the love of the game!
Ah, forgive me. I'm the coach of the\nBrazil Youth Soccer team, here for an away game.
Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to get\nin the way of your practice. I hope\nyou'll excuse my interruption.
I don't doubt it, I can see your passion\njust by how you kick that ball.
You're on the All-Japan Junior Youth team,\nare you not?
As fate would have it, I used to train a Japanese\nyoungster some time ago. We'd train together\non nights like this.
Speaking of which... I don't mean to be too\ncritical, but isn't it kind of a waste that you're\nout training all by yourself?
What do you mean?
Ah, I guess you're right...
You're a national representative. That means\nyou're surrounded by highly-talented players, no?
If that's true, then isn't it really\nimportant that you all practice together?
Yep. Being picked as a national rep means you're\nplaying alongside a lot of highly-talented people.
I bet that makes it a lot more fun if you all\npractice together. I imagine they'd agree.
Ah, that's the team. Better get myself\nback to the dorm here shortly.
I'll leave you to your training.\nPractice hard and good luck!
People rank him alongside Schneider in\nEurope, so you know he's got real skill.
Yes, Coach!





Hey, <avatar_name>, got a minute?
I've been noticing you seem a bit\ndistracted at practice lately.
You're not getting a big head because\nyou're All-Japan AND a regular starter?
Nah, that's all in YOUR head.
Ah, I'm sorry. I'll try to be more focused.
You think a prodigy needs practice?
Hey, no need to get snippy, spiffy.
Sure, you've got talent, but take a minute and\nthink about where the polish came from. Got it?
Glad to hear it.
Listen up, you can be the most naturally talented\nplayer on the planet, but you slack off and you'll\nget left in the dust. So buckle down.
Kid, you didn't used to be such a punk.\nWhat happened to you?
Of course, it's not just Kluivoort either.\nThey're all sharp as tacks, and they're\nnot going to let their guard down for you.
Hey, <avatar_name>. We need to talk.
I've seen how you're acting lately at practice.\nIt's impossible to miss.\nYou're hardly even trying out there, man!
You don't think you're too good for practice just\nbecause you're All-Japan AND a regular starter?
You're great without practice though, right?
Ah, I'm sorry. I'll work harder.
Knock off the captain stuff. I'm All-Japan now.
...Hrmph!
I can't believe you'd say something like that.
My not being able to practice despite wanting to\nand your awful attitude are two different things.
I thought you knew the difference...
I'm glad you get what I'm saying.
You've got the talent for the game, and unlike\nme, you've got the health and heart to be\nable to practice. So don't waste it.
If that's your deal, then fine. Do whatever.
But you need to hear this, at least. That awful\nattitude you've got about practice is the same as\nthrowing all your talent in the dumpster.
Plus, I know you're watching their attackers,\nbut they've got some skilled defenders\nin the backfield too.
Yo, <avatar_name>.
What exactly do you think you've been\naccomplishing out there in practice?! This ain't\nsome schoolyard pick-up game.
You're not letting it get to your head that\nyou're a regular starter for Japan, are you?
You tryin' to say something?
Ah, I'm sorry. I'll think it through.
You're a funny guy, trying to step to a prodigy.
You know what! I got a lot to say to you!
Whoa, Takeshi...
You didn't used to be like this back at school!\nWhat happened to you, huh? Tell me!
Back off, Takeshi.\nHe's not gonna listen to reason.
Hyuga...
He's gotta figure his stuff out on his own,\nthat's all there is to it. Let's get out of here.
Right...
...So you're snapping out of it, then?
Good. It'd be a shame for\nyour talent to go to waste.
You little, arrogant punk!
Whoa, Hyuga!
Get off me, Wakashimazu!
I get it! I know what you're feeling!\nBut socking him isn't gonna do any good!
Ngaaa!
Alright, fine. You can let me go now.
Okay.
... I don't even know who you are anymore.\nGo do whatever you're gonna do.
Even if you get possession, it's not\ngoing to be easy driving to their goal.
Preliminaries Block C, Argentina vs. Saudi Arabia
Come on! We're gonna miss the\nmatch if you guys don't hurry it up!
Tsubasa... Come on man, hold up a sec...
We stayed out training so long, it'd\nbe good to catch a match, but really...
Ah, guess we just missed the match...
Łoł!
Well dang, would ya look at that score!
Yeah, how in the heck did they\nget up by that much?!
Argentina absolutely demolished them!
Star Crown Stadium is honored to host\none of the world's great soccer geniuses!
He's a shining star of his generation in\nArgentina, talented not only at bringing in goals,\nbut bringing together winning games from midfield!
Ladies and gentlemen, he's\nthe one, the only, Juan Diaz!
Heh heh...
The young Diaz was kind enough\nto join us for an interview.
I saw Japan's number 10 blow past the Italian\nplayers with his South American-style dribbling,\nand I figured I could do the same.
There are a lot of nations represented here\nwith all different styles and talents.\nBut I'm not planning on losing to any of them.
At the end of the day, it's gonna be me\nand the rest of Argentina coming out on top.
He's an attacking midfielder, who scores a lot\nand leads his team... Sounds like our own Tsubasa.
Juan Diaz...
Alright, nice shot! Keep up that pace!
I've been looking all over for you, Roberto.
And who are you then?
I spoke to the American Soccer Association. Turns\nout the Sao Paulo youth coach is here for an away\ngame. Turns out you're here for an away game.
...
You're not going to lie and say\nyou're not THE Roberto Hongo, are you?
...I guess you've caught me.
But please, don't tell Tsubasa\nI'm here in America.
Why?
I... I don't deserve to be around Tsubasa.
Three years ago, I broke a promise to him,\nand I went home to Brazil... alone.
I left because I didn't have the self-confidence\nthat I could teach him.
But even without me, Tsubasa's become\nso much more. He is truly one of the great\ntalents of soccer.
Early this year, Sao Paulo got a video\nfrom the Japan Soccer Association.
In that video, I saw a better, stronger\nTsubasa than I'd seen before.
The letter that came with the video said,\n"the kid in this video dreams of going to Brazil\nand becoming a professional soccer player."
I couldn't help but cry when I saw it.
...
And now here he is, even more of a man and even\ngreater of a player than I saw in that video...
But, Roberto.
You should know how Tsubasa thought\nof you not taking him to Brazil.
He believed he wasn't ready for that step yet.\nIt made him want to be a better player.
That's why he gave himself a special mission.
To not lose to a single opponent in his three\nyears in middle school, to win all his public\nmatches so he could make it in Brazil.
He told me that if he couldn't do that,\nthat he knew he still didn't have the talent\nto go pro in Brazil.
And Tsubasa took the notes you\nleft to heart. They became a guiding\nlight for how he could improve.
And now, this summer, Tsubasa\nfinally succeeded in his mission.
Tsubasa never lost a single public match in his\nthree years at middle school. Even at the\nNational MS Soccer Tournament.
...!
Tsubasa won three national tournaments in a row,\nand after he graduates from middle school,\nI have no doubt he will head for Brazil.
The notes you wrote for him?\nHe mastered everything in them.
...
Be Tsubasa's coach when he returns\nto Brazil. I'm asking you, please.
Please, help him to fulfill his dream once again.
...!
They're a top-tier team with a good shot at\nwinning the tourney, but don't let it worry you.\nCome out fighting just like a good underdog would.
Italy was a favorite to win, too, but you\ntook 'em down. Give it your very best,\nand I believe you can win this.
Let's bring home another victory\nand secure our slot in the finals!
About that... Misugi, we're going to need you\ntoday in the second half, so make sure you're\nready to go.
Your skills aren't in question here, but we need\nyou all in on the pitch, especially today!
I need you to analyze their style during\nthe first half and use what you know\nto beat them when you come on.
Great job, boys! It's not easy\nto stop Netherlands' offense.
But don't get overconfident.
Against a team that aggressive, once they\ngain momentum it'll be hard to stop them.
Try to keep it up without falling into\ntheir rhythm or losing your own.
Yes, Coach!




The Netherlands...\nDefinitely got a bit of the jitters.
You're playing the country you've always\nlooked up to. I think anyone would feel\nthe same if they were in your shoes.
I bet if I was up against Brazil I'd feel\njust like you do right now, Misugi.
Heh, even you, Tsubasa?
If I can get even a few minutes on\nthe pitch, I want to see how well\nI measure up to Dutch soccer.
So the second half won't be easy,\nso rest your hooves while you can.
Huh?!
Great job, boys! It's not easy\nto stop that Dutch offense.
Against a team that aggressive, once they\ngain momentum it'll be hard to stop them.
O-Okay!
You'll be great, Misugi!
Yeah, I can't believe my dream\nis coming true so soon!
And you know I'm gonna be\nright there working hard to make\nsure you don't show me up!
This is great!
Hey now, don't get too pumped up just yet, okay?
Time for a number 14 showdown!
Ah, I don't even know what to say.
It's been my dream to go up against the\nNetherlands. When it's my time, I'm going to be\nready to go all out, you can count on that!
He's right, Misugi. Don't get too worked up too\nearly or you might tire yourself out before you\neven get to the pitch!
Gotcha. It's not show time, yet.
Right. I'm cool, I'm composed, and I'm sure going\nto be ready for battle when the time comes.
It's finally here... a showdown with Kluivoort.
It's okay, Misugi. You've got the\nskills to face him. Trust me, I know!
Tsubasa, thank you. Coming from you,\nthat really gives me the courage to fight.
The Japanese team has been steadily improving in\ntheir matches since they landed here in the US.
Despite being the underdogs, Japan got\npast keeper Hernandez to topple Italy.
Getting a ball past Hernandez and into the net\ndoesn't just happen. There's no doubt in my mind\nthat Japan has genuine skill.
Forget the Japan you saw in the scrimmages.\nYou're going to have to be on your toes.
Coach, don't worry about it. Japan's net is going\nto be on fire with all the shots I put in.
Kluivoort...
Italy going down was a surprise to all of us, but\nwe're still out of their league. Let's play like\nwe always play, and win like we always win!
I like the confidence, but I need you\nto not take your opponents so lightly.
Coach is right. Doesn't matter about the rest of\nit, they were able to score on Hernandez, and\nthat's somethin'.
You can never be too careful, Kluivoort.
Who cares how much they can\nscore? Long as we can score...
Then we just gotta score more, right?
Yep. That's the size of it.
Klismann's just scared, that's all.
Not scared. Serious. I've seen how\nthey play, and we need a wake-up call.
Just checkin', but when did you\nbecome such a wuss, Klismann?
Rensen, why've you gotta be a jerk?
Look, too much caution's\nthe same as being a coward.
What am I going to do with you guys...
Okay, we got the message. No detailed\norders from me, you guys go give 'em hell.
Yes, Coach!




Okay guys, listen up. We're here for total\nvictory. All wins, no losses. This is just one\nstop on the way.
Right, right. Let's go knock some\nballs around, real casual-like.
Yeah, we're in it to win it.\nThis tournament is ours.
Yep. We're going to show them\nwe're the best players on the planet.
Now that we're all on the\nsame page... Orders, Captain?
Okay!
We're not settling for a petty handful of goals\ntoday. Dutch soccer is about striking at all\ntimes.
This match is ours, no\nquestion about it. Let's do it!
Tak!



Here we are, folks! Back at the\nJunior Youth World Challenge Preliminaries\nand the second match for the All Japan team.
Italy's Azzurri blue turns to fierce Dutch orange\nfor Japan as they face off against the\nNetherlands, another fearsome opponent.
The aggressive Dutch team is guaranteed to be\npoised to score at any moment, with top-tier\ntalents stacked up in the frontline.
Eyes are on Captain Kluivoort, fresh from an\nastounding victory over Senegal. He's one of the\nmost devastating strikers in the tournament.
Still, the Japanese team\nis not to be taken lightly!
Japan's steady, resolute effort in the three\nscrimmages and their first preliminary match has\nmade them a formidable force on the field!
They may have shown the greatest growth of any\nteam in this tournament since arriving here in the\nUnited States.
No doubt they'll put up a good fight even\nagainst the powerhouse that is the\nNetherlands. Let's see what they can do!
Hey Tsubasa, got a second?
What is it?
It's Brian Kluivoort. I wish I could say\nI don't mind him taking his shots from\noutside the penalty box... but I can't.
That's crazy. What are you talking about?\nAnd why are you telling me this?
I am usually fully confident I can\nblock a shot from outside the box.
But I hate to say it... Even from outside the\nbox, Schneider's Fire Shot has a fifty-fifty\nchance of scoring.
And as far as I can see, Kluivoort's able to\nshoot with nearly the force of a Fire Shot.
Say what?!
So I just wanted to warn you.\nI'd hate to see us lose, after all.
Okay, then... Should be an interesting match!
Seriously?!
You say he's able to steal points off of you\neven from outside the penalty box?
I'd say that's gonna be an exciting game,\nif I'm going up against such an amazing player!
Wakabayashi, we're going all in!\nWe're going all in, and we're gonna win!
Tsubasa... you're really somethin' else.
Same old Tsubasa back from three years ago.
Hmph, alright! Leave the goal to me!
(So that's Brian Kluivoort...)
(I'm excited to see what\nhe's gonna try to pull off!)
(That must be their captain.)
(Looks like I'm not even registering for them.)
(Now that I think about it, it's\nbeen like that since we got here.)
(Guess I've gotta take this tournament by the\nhorns and change that! They're going to see that\nwe're winners!)
I thought Japan would just be a bunch of\nlittle kids who look like elementary schoolers,\nbut some of them have big builds.
I see one or two that could\npotentially be a match for me.
Wouldn't be any fun for us without\na little challenge, am I right?
Can't argue with that.
Hmph, I don't care who we're up against,\nI'll tear their defense down brick by brick.
After that, we just keep the goals coming!\nWe're aiming for another pure victory here!
Tak!



Alright guys, remember,\nthis is what we came here for.
And there's nothing to fear!
Bring it on, Japan.
Prepare to get stomped!
You don't belong out here,\nshrimp!
Y-You piece of...!
You're pretty cheeky for a\nshrimp!
You wouldn't have won if you\nweren't so slippery!
Ha! So even Japan's got dudes\nlike that, huh?
Not half bad!
Whoa, he really is good!
Guess I'm just better!
You need more than muscles to\nstop me!
Ngh... Just as strong as I'd\nheard.
Oh right, you're Wakabayashi \nfrom Hamburg, right?
Isn't that the same shot \nas Schneider's?!
You'll never stand up to my\nStinger!
S-See? Even I can do it if I\ntry!
Hmph, you've got guts, at\nleast.
And here it is! Kluivoort's trump card, the\nStinger! Japan's keeper didn't stand a chance!
Nice one, Kluivoort!
That's our captain!
Hmph. There's nothing my Stinger can't pierce.
Gah! I never thought someone other\nthan Schneider could pull that off...
But it's not getting past me again!
That was on the same level as the Fire Shot.
But I'll get it next time!
I-I could barely even react to that...
But I'll stop it next time... Even if it kills me!
It doesn't matter how amazing his shot is, it's\njust one point! And if they score, then we just\nneed to score one!
Now it's time for our All-Japan counterattack!
Hooray! We did it! That goal just\nnow was worth ten points, easy!
Don't be stupid. A goal's a goal.
C'mon, at least try to get a little into it.
Cuz if you don't, Kluivoort's going\nto be taking home all the glory!
I guess you're right. It's time we taught Japan\nthat Kluivoort's not the only Dutch forward!
Well, that's simple enough!\nJust score the next goal!
Ya see that, Netherlands!\nThat's my Neo Tiger Shot!
Hmph, guess Japan's got some talent, too.
Well, whatever, we just need to score even more.
I can't believe Japan has such\nskill!
Hmph, better than I expected!
It's not working? Am I not\ngood enough?
Let's show them how the\ngame is meant to be played!
We're seeing some activity on the Netherlands' front line!
Are they about to show us what the Dutch have hidden up their sleeves?
No way! How could I lose...?!
Hmph. Know your place.
Not bad!
What, is that all?
I... lost?!
What'd you expect?
You're kidding me! I lost?!
Is that all you've got?
I wasn't good enough...
Like I'd ever lose to you!
Who's this number 10 guy?!
Ngh, what incredible strength!
I'm not gonna lose a contest\nof strength!
My strength wasn't enough...?
And that's the first half!
Japan's putting up a great fight\nagainst such a fierce opponent!
Netherlands specializes in offense,\nbut Japan hasn't surrendered the lead!
And that's the half!
Japan was somehow able to\nhold off the Dutch barrage of\nattacks! Both teams are tied!
And that's the half!
Not only has Japan been unable to hold of the\nrelentless Dutch assault, they're now trailing!
Try to keep it up without falling into\ntheir rhythm or losing your own.
Actually, I want you to think of the tie as if\nwe're losing, and try to get your second wind.
So the second half won't be easy,\nso rest your hooves while you can.
Good work out there, boys. We're\nbehind, but we can still turn this around.
Just calm down and endure their offense. Be\npatient, and you'll get your chance to score.
Yessir!




That Kluivoort is one crazy player, huh?
Yeah, both his power and his technique are\namazing. And even when he takes a hit, his\nconfidence never falters.
Yeah, after seeing him up close...
True, even though we have the lead,\nhe's just as cocky as ever.
Yeah, that's the face of a man who knows\nhe can turn any situation around.
So Tsubasa, how do you feel\nafter seeing the Dutch up close?
Well, they're really good...
And man, can't forget that traditional Dutch\nstrategy of pushing for goals above all else.
Plus, just look at Kluivoort. That\nguy is as cool as a cucumber.
Yeah, I agree.
You heard the coach. Stay focused out there.
Just look at Kluivoort. Even though\nhe lost the lead, he's still so\nconfident he looks almost smug.
True, even though we have the\nlead, he's just as cocky as ever.
Yeah, that's the face of a man who\nknows he can turn this game around.
And it's not just Kluivoort either. They're all\nworld-class players, and they're not going\nto roll over no matter what the point gap is.
If we try to focus on protecting our lead next\nhalf, I'm sure they'll just punch an opening\nsomewhere.
So we need to keep up the offense,\ntoo, and keep kicking in goals!
Tak!




(Tsubasa really is at the heart of this team.)
(And for the other side, no doubt it's Kluivoort.)
(As long as Kluivoort's confident,\nthe Dutch will never let up.)
(So Tsubasa's right. This\nsecond half won't be easy.)
(If only I could play the full match. I don't\nwant to miss out on an amazing game like this.)
(Jeez, I hate this body...)
I know that look, Misugi.\nFrustrated you can't play?
Hyuga?
I've been there. I had to\nsit out just this summer.
But I guess that was my own fault.
But... you're the reason...
What do you mean?
Eh... never mind, don't worry about it.
Still, I think it's great that you'll\nget your chance, eventually.
Yeah, it is.
We're definitely gonna need those beautiful plays\nyou showed me back at the Tokyo regional finals.
Heh, I can't believe you of\nall people are telling me this.
But yeah, I may have been benched this first\nhalf, but I always knew I'd be playing with you\nguys at some point this game.
And I'm more than ready for it.
Can't wait to see it.
Okay, it's almost time.
We may have the lead for now, but I want you all\nscoring points like the game depends on it!\nBecause it does!
We're DEFINITELY winning this!
Tak!




If you can do that, I know you can win.
The second half won't be easy.
So get some rest while you can.
So that's why you wanted to wear number 14.
It's good to have someone to admire.\nOnly way to grow is to look up!
Yessir!




Coach is right. Against an aggressive opponent\nlike the Dutch, we might as well be losing.
Let's aim for more points,\nas if the game depended on it!
Tak!




(Tsubasa really is the heart of\nthe team, even emotionally.)
(And for the other side, no doubt it's Kluivoort.)
(If we can break his confidence, the rest\nof the team would go down with him.)
(And there's our chance to win.)
(So as long as I can make that happen...)
You're up, Misugi.
I've been waiting here on the bench. Now\nwe get to make this win happen together!
This is just what I think, but isn't our\nbest chance to win this game going\nto be by crushing Kluivoort?
Heh, so you were thinking the same thing.
Well, I'll show you that\nI can give us that chance.
Alright!
Now let's go. The second half is about to begin.
Okay guys, let's do this!
We made it this far, didn't we?\nWe're winning this!
Tak!




Gah, I can't believe we're doing\nthis badly against JAPAN.
They're way more tenacious\nthan we gave 'em credit for.
Guess it wasn't a fluke that they beat Italy.
Hmph. Why bother worrying about the first half?
Kluivoort...
The points mean nothing until the final whistle\nblows. We just have to win from here.
I don't care how big of a gap there is, I just\nhave to score enough to close it and then some.
If we want to be the best in the world, we can't\nslip up over a little thing like this, now can we?
...Yeah, sorry Kluivoort. Always glad\nto have your confidence on our side.
This tournament is where I'll\nprove that I'm the world's best.
So just leave it to me. I'll pierce Japan's\ngoal as many times as I have to.
Hey, you think we'd let you have all the fun?\nRight, Rensen? We can line up some goals, too!
I thought it went without saying.
Okay, let's do this guys!\nWe'll be the ones winning in the end!
Tak!




Okay! Let's split it up: offense and\ndefense. Head over to your goals\nand work on your combinations.
Okay, that's it for today's training!\nClean up and let's get out of here!
...
...
...
Yes, Sir!




Sheesh... Their offense is crazy.
You got that right. Wouldn't surprise me\nif they're the best in the tournament.
Plus, did you see their speed and technique?\nI can't believe we're all middle schoolers.
It's pathetic, but I don't think I could\nstop that shot in a million years...
C'mon, get it together guys!
Did you already forget my clash with Kluivoort?
They're not untouchable. There's always a way!
Jito...
Plus, they think they've already won.
In a fight, that's your best\nchance ta really lay it on 'em!
So turnin' that aroun' now's what we needta do!
Jito's right.
You can tell just by looking, but with\noverconfidence comes carelessness.
Plus, when you compare us overall,\nwe definitely have the upper hand.
So I want us to think about how we\ncan secure goals, no matter what.
Hmph, that's Tsubasa fer ya. He sure\nknows 'is way around a tough fight.
Um, Jito, could you NOT compare\neverything to fighting?
What's the difference? They're both competitions!
Hmm, I don't really get it, but after listening\nto you two I definitely feel like we can do this!
Yeah, we'll pay them back\ndouble for the first half!
Pow! Knock 'em right in the snot locker!
Guys, the moment you flinch\nis the moment they strike!
Tsubasa...
One of our opponents' strengths\nis their unshakeable self-confidence.
Lose heart in a match like\nthis and we'll never win.
Tsubasa's right. I still wanna win this match.
That's right. Didn't we come all\nthis way to take on the world?
Yeah, and if that were easy,\nit wouldn't be worth doing.
I guess... My bad. I shouldn't have said all that.
Yeah, we just gotta give this our all!
And you too, Takeshi! I want you thinking\n"there's no way we're losing to them!"
S-Sorry! I will!
(We're losing, but the team's in a\ngood mood. Maybe we'll pull this off.)
(Tsubasa's right though. One of the Netherlands'\nstrengths is their confidence, which all stems\nfrom Kluivoort.)
(But if you turn that around, their\nassuredness will flag with their leader's.)
(If the timing works out, I could\nbeat him one on one, or maybe...)
What's up, Misugi?
Oh, I was just thinking that you're right.\nTheir strength comes from their confidence.
So I was wondering how we\ncould shatter that confidence.
Actually, I was wondering about that too.
In the end, I think it has to start\nwith their captain, Kluivoort.
Heh, great minds...
...Sorry if this is selfish of me,\nbut I want to be the one to do it.
You?
Are you worried I'm not good enough?
Of course not.
Yeah, with the beautiful moves you\nshowed me back at the Tokyo regionals,\nI know we can win.
Then, leave it to me.
Sure. We're counting on you, Misugi!
Okay, it's almost time.
Don't give up! No matter what!
We can definitely turn this around!
Tak!




These guys are nothing special.
And if Italy lost to them, then I\nguess Italy's not much either.
Yeah, once we get 'em surrounded,\nthey don't stand a chance.
It's like, the preliminaries are kids' stuff.\nThe finals tournament is when it really starts.
Just keep it up in the second half.
Even if they score on us, we'll just score even\nmore. We're aiming to be the top scorer in the\ntournament.
Heh, that'd be nice. Maybe we\nshould go a little crazy this next half.
Yeah, I feel a little sorry for Japan,\nbut we're not holding back!
Alright, let's show 'em a thing or two!
Tak!




(Finally, today I'm up against the Netherlands.)
(Will my current skills even work against them?)
(No, I can't doubt myself now.)
(All I need to do is use what I have.)
(And I can't forget Kluivoort.\nI'll be looking for the big 14.)
(I haven't looked forward to playing against\nsomeone so much since Tsubasa.)
That guy's wearing number 14 too...
Time to give him a front row seat to my show.
(That jerk Dirk... Looking down\non me just cuz I'm short!)
What's got YOU so bent outta shape, Sano?
Oh, Jito. Listen to this...
...And he called me a shrimp!\nSeriously, I've had it up to here!
If you're mad, then ya just gotta\nshow him who's boss.
Eh?
Nothin' hurts a defender more\nthan givin' up a goal. So jus' do that.
And I was our captain back at Hirado MS,\nright? An insult to you's an insult ta me, too!\nSo go get 'im!
Jito...
Racja! But I'm not going to settle\nfor just one goal, I'm taking two!
Yeah, show 'im what's what!
Japan was in top form for the first\nhalf, and came in to take the lead.
But they're up against the Netherlands,\nwho aren't going to take this lying down!
Can Japan continue to withstand the\nonslaught? I can't wait to find out!
Alright, we're at the start of the second half.
Japan and the Netherlands are evenly\nmatched with neither side willing to back\ndown in the first half.
So which team can command\nthe lead and win the second half?
Alright, we're about to start the second half.
In the first half, Japan crumpled under the\nfierce assault from the Dutch team and\nsurrendered the lead!
But they've shown remarkable growth since\ncoming to America, so look forward to a\nforthcoming brilliant display of strategy!
Alright, we're about to start the second half.
You'll be lucky to touch the\nball this half.
We're winning this, Japan!
Grah, I still can't believe\nI lost to someone like you!
See that, Dirk? Bigger doesn't mean better!
Nice, Sano! Jus' like I raised ya!
Thank you, Jito.
For what? A cap's always gotta\nlook out for 'is teammates.
(You can't normally tell, but Sano's a real\nfighter. He's jus' the guy to lead Hirado MS\nwhen I'm gone.)
(With tha' spirit, 'e might even\nwin at Nationals next year!)
What?! This number 14 is\nridiculous!
But that's what makes it all\nworth it!
Let's go for a fast break, guys!
At Misugi's command, Japan\nis going on the offensive!
And what's this?! Japan's defenders are\noverlapping each other in a crisscross! They're\nmoving into the newly opened up space!
This is bad news bears...
Come on! Let's mark those defenders!
The Dutch players are advancing to mark\nJapan's defenders! They're trying to cut off\ntheir offense!
What the--?!
Goalies can do more than just defend!
What's he doing?! Look how far the\ngoalie, Wakashimazu, has advanced!
They're just leaving their goal\nwide open?! Against us?!
Perhaps shocked by this unexpected play,\nthe Dutch players have gotten sluggish!
Nice one, Wakashimazu!
Pass it to Tsubasa!
(You were the first and only man to score on me\nin the Regionals, Misugi. And you scored twice.)
I'm trusting you!
(When we had our first showdown in elementary\nschool, I was blown away by what I saw.)
Tsubasa doesn't push it, and returns\nthe ball to the advancing Misugi!
And Misugi immediately sends it to Misaki!
(Misugi, when I first saw you in elementary,\nyou already seemed like you could do anything.\nA true soccer prodigy.)
Misaki returns it to Misugi, who passes to Hyuga!
(I nearly fell to my knees in awe of your\nbeautiful play in the Regional finals.)
Hyuga enters a shooting stance as\nthe giant defender from the Netherlands,\nLeon Dirk, approaches!
Like we'd let someone like you steal the glory!
Over here, Hyuga!
On it!
Hyuga immediately switches to a pass to\nMisugi, who's now inside the penalty box!
This is it! You're mine!
Misugi is clear and gets ready to shoot!
(Jun Misugi...)
(If it weren't for your bad\nheart, you might've been...)
(The best player in Japan!)
I won't lose! Not to YOU!
Oh my, Kluivoort's made it all\nthe way back to block the shot!
(Perfect!)
Oh no! Misugi's shot hit Kluivoort's\nlegs! It's rebounding into the air!
Is this the end of Japan's offense?!
(I made it!)
Im-Impossible!
No, it isn't! It's as if he looked into the\nfuture! Misugi has leaped after the\nball without hesitation!
Here it goes!
Oh my! Misugi's bringing back the\ncrowd-pleasing acrobatics he once\ndisplayed in elementary school!
Misugi makes a daring overhead kick!\nThe goalie Doleman can't reach it in time!
He's done it! Japan's OTHER prodigy has done it!
What a play! Everything needed to come\ntogether perfectly, even the goalie's position!
A million dollar goal from Misugi,\ndespite his handicap!
A standing ovation from Japan's fans in the\naudience, not to mention his teammates!
That's our Young Noble of the Field!
All right! We did it!
You did it, Misugi!
I knew you could do it!
If anyone could, it's you!
That... number 14.
Their movements got way better\nwhen he took command.
I lost...? To him...? Number 14!
Calm down, Kluivoort. Everyone screwed up here.
No, I have to make up for this one myself!
There's still time! We'll keep\nattacking as long as we can!
And that's the match!
Japan has defeated not only Italy,\nbut the Netherlands as well!
All-Japan has shown us that they can stand\ntoe-to-toe with the best in the world!
And I'm sure they'll keep doing so\nin their matches to come, as well!
If they keep this up, they're looking to advance\nthrough the preliminaries without a single loss!
And that's the match!
All-Japan fought hard against the titanic\nNetherlands, but to little avail!\nIt ends in a draw!
And that's the match!
As expected, the Netherlands is the stronger team!
All-Japan's struggle was in vain\nagainst their foes' unrelenting offense!
We won! We really won! We did it!
This is crazy! They were a favorite to\nwin the tournament, and we beat them!
It was a tough match, especially\nafter Italy, but we did it!
They can't call it a fluke now!\nWe're really that good!
We came back after all that, eh?\nHmph, guess my encouragement paid off.
Yeah, because you're not the only\nsimple-minded guy here, Jito.
You say somethin', Sano?
I-I mean, that's my captain!
Ha ha ha! Ain't that right!
Jus' goes to show that it ain't over\n'til it's over.
Heh, if we keep beating all these favorites to\nwin, doesn't that mean we're on our way to the\nchampionship?
Yeah, we're not who we were when we started this!
That's for sure. We've really grown, huh?
All our work has done some good.
Yeah, effort and guts are our\nonly saving grace, after all!
Speak for yourself! The rest of us have talent!
Alright, let's keep this up and win the\nnext one, too! We're going for a\nperfect record in the prelims!
Tak!




(Still, that Brian Kluivoort...\nWhat a terrifying opponent.)
(I need to train even harder\nif I want to keep up!)
W-We... lost.
No way... This isn't happening!
How could we lose here...?
...
Don't let it get to you, guys!
Kluivoort...
I mean, yeah, there goes\nour dream of a perfect record.
But if we beat Italy in the next round,\nwe can still be the champions!
We don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves!
K-Kluivoort's right!
Yeah, we're not out just yet.
We're counting on you, Kluivoort!
Sure, just leave it to me.\nNext time I'm taking the victory for sure!
But for now, let's just be good sports about it,\nand wish the best for the guys who beat us.
(I'll never forget today's disgrace...)
(But next time, we're winning for sure!)
(I hope you're looking forward to it!)
Yo! Looks like the Jun Misugi\nthe prodigy's still got it.
Yeah, nice one Misugi.\nThat one point won us the game.
No, it's thanks to all of you,\nfor turning my vision into reality.
The entire team did it, together.
That's sure not how the audience\nsaw it though. Just listen to them!
No no no, I couldn't have done it on my own...
Oh no, the pain of being popular!\nJeez, I wish I were you, man!
I think you need a little more training,\nIshizaki. I'll think up a special training\nmenu for you, starting tomorrow!
Seriously? C'mon, I'm sorry!
(That number 14... He\nreally got me back there.)
(We'll settle this next time, Misugi!)
(I hope you're looking forward to it!)
(That <avatar_name> guy...\nI knew he had a knack for scoring,\nbut he's even better than I thought...)
(Hmph. I guess talent doesn't\ncare where you were born.)
(That number 23's sure got a knack for scoring...\nSince when did Japan have a prodigy like that?)
(Hmph. I guess the world's\nmore exciting than I thought.)
What's the matter, Kluivoort?
Eh, it's nothing. Let's go.
(Still, that <avatar_name> guy\nwas good enough to stop our offense.)
(And I didn't even realize it when\nwe met. I guess I'm still green, too.)
(Still, that number 23 was good enough\nto stop our offense. I can't believe it.)
(Guess I should be more careful\ngoing into my future games.)
C'mon, let's get going.
Sure.
Junior Youth World Challenge Preliminaries,\nBlock A, Second Match, Italy vs. Senegal
Italy and Senegal, huh? Which do you think'll win?
My money's on Italy.
Yeah, Senegal likes to use their speed to get\npast the enemy defense, but Italy likes to lock\ndown right in front of the goal.
In other words, Senegal can't play their game.
Hey, look at Senegal's formation!
Is... Senegal drawing back?
They must be feeling timid\nafter their big loss earlier.
Do you think they're planning something?
Eh, seems basic. They just know it's hard to go\nwith a long ball strategy against Italy, so\nthey're trying to lure them out first.
Italy specializes in defense and counterattacks,\nso it'd be hard to go with a long ball strategy.\nSo they're trying to lure them out first.
I checked the data on Senegal, including their\nscrimmages, but this is the first time they've\nused this strategy.
If it's from the coach, it's always scary to go\nwith a strategy you're not used to. I wonder if\nit'll make them nervous.
For sure. Plus, outta the two teams, Italy has\nbetter technique. Do they really expect this to\nwork?
(So Senegal's aiming to get behind\nus when we attack, huh?)
(In that case...!)
And the match has begun!
Łoł! At Hernandez's direction, Italy is\nsuddenly bringing the entire team forward!
Senegal is caught off guard! They can't\nkeep up with Italy's swift passing!
And now Rusciano has the ball!
Ha! Did you think an obvious tactic\nlike that would work on us?
They already scored! Seriously?!
Hernandez saw through Senegal's\nplan, and stormed right in.
It all happened so fast! And Senegal\ncouldn't keep up in their new formation.\nThat's how you win.
Now Senegal has no choice but to go on the\noffensive, but the more they do, the more they\nfall into Italy's trap. Italy's already won.
And that's game!
Total victory for Italy!
Even Senghor's precise long balls\njust fall into Italy's defensive net!
And his desperate longshot was\njust stopped by Hernandez!
And in return, Senegal was eaten alive by\nRusciano's counterattacks, giving up one point\nafter another!
Despite Senegal's overwhelming possession\ntime and constant offense, they failed to score\neven a single point!
This marks Senegal's second loss, assuring\nthey won't make it out of the prelims!
Now, Italy is now tied with the Netherlands\nat three points apiece, and they'll be going\nhead to head in a final showdown!
That went exactly as expected.
So Senegal can't make it past the preliminaries\nanymore, right? So there goes their motivation.
Then this should be an easy win.
(...)
(True, their movements out there were a\nmess, and they're totally uncoordinated...)
(But they're fast, and good jumpers too. If they\nput enough power behind that speed I'm not sure we\ncan stop them.)
(If... Just if... something brings their\nteam together, they could be a major threat.)
Nice work in practice today, Sano!
Yeah, same to you!
Yo, <avatar_name>, nice work out there!
Finally, what we've all\nbeen waiting for... dinner!
I wonder what's on the menu today.
After dinner we have free time, right?
I'm gonna take a shower first.
Good question... We know\nthey'll have meat, at least.
Seriously. Ever since we got to America,\nit's been nothing but meat at every single meal.
Yeah, and it's freakin' amazing.\nIt's like I died and went to heaven.
I'm with ya there. After seeing their food, I\nthink I know why all their players are so huge.
What are you talking about?\nWe have to study tonight.
Yeesh, not looking forward to that...
You need to study if you want\nto get into a good high school.
You're one to talk.
Hey now...
*sigh*


And that's why you gotta study,\n<avatar_name>. So you don't\nend up like those two.
Seriously. I'm dripping with sweat.\nThe sooner I get to a shower, the better.
...
What's wrong, Ishizaki?
I need more than a shower, I want a BATH.
Yeah, but the dorms only have showers.
I know! Would it've been so\nhard to put in a single full bath?
Guess that's what happens when\nyour family runs a bathhouse.
...
What's wrong, Tsubasa? You don't\nlook so good. Are you sleepin' okay?
Thanks. I'm fine.
If you say so. Just save some for the games, okay?
Yeah, for sure.
...
It's no good. It needs to\nbe faster, with more spin...
Figures you'd be in a place like this.
Hyuga!
You're trying to improve your Drive Shot, huh?
Yeah. But it's not going great.
Here, try using this.
But this is... This is your black training ball.
Nothing wrong with getting a little\nhelp from others when you're stuck.
I mean... that's what I did.
Hyuga...
Don't try to solve everything\non your own, Tsubasa.
...
Thanks, Hyuga. For letting me use this.
Anytime.
Preliminaries Block C, Brazil vs. Saudi Arabia
Finally... I finally get to\nwatch a match with Brazil.
Yeah, I guess with your training schedule you\nhaven't been able to make it into the stands much.
I'm looking forward to this too. I've never been\nable to see one of their matches in person either.
(Brazil's number 10 is Carlos Bara. I only\ntrained with him for a little while, but that was\nmore than enough to realize how amazing he is.)
(I wonder what kind of plays\nI'll get to see in this match!)
(Roberto used to be Brazil's number 10.)
(That wasn't in the Junior Youth, but Carlos Bara\nis wearing that number now... I wonder what kind\nof plays he'll put on the field today.)
We're nearly ten minutes into the first half, and\nboth teams are tied at nil! Saudi Arabia's putting\nup a good fight!
It was like this in their last game\nagainst Spain, too, but Brazil's\npasses just aren't coming together!
Whoops, looks like one Saudi Arabia\njust picked one off! This is bad, folks!
What is this? Since when did Brazil suck so bad?
(What in the... Brazilian soccer\nisn't supposed to be this messy...)
Saudi Arabia's got the ball, and\nis coming up on Brazil's goal!
But what's this? A Brazilian player\nis approaching with terrifying force!
It's a tackle from Brazil's number 10, Carlos\nBara! He stole the ball from Saudi Arabia!
And just like that, Brazil is on the offensive!
Carlos breaks though on his own! He's slipping\npast Saudi Arabia's players one after another!
Luciano Leo and Captain Alberto\nare advancing to back him up!
But Carlos isn't looking back! Does he\nplan to take it all the way in on his own?!
And it's in! Carlos covered more than\nhalf the field and scored all on his own!
Tackling, dribbling, shooting, what can't this\nboy do?! And with such precise technique!\nThat's Brazil's number 10, ladies and gentlemen!
Łoł! Brazil's ace is crazy good.
...
Tsubasa?
And that's the game!
Brazil crushes Saudi Arabia!
While they had a tough start, Brazil came\ntogether and finished with a tremendous lead!
Looks like their ace Carlos kept his good form\nfrom last match, hammering goals home like a\nmachine today.
But let's not forget their midfielder Leo,\nCaptain Alberto on defense, and their goalie\nKeizinho, who all played a part in this victory!
Still, Carlos has quite the poker face. He shows\nno change in expression even when scoring a goal,\nor even when he's won the match.
Was this just a foregone conclusion to him?\nThere's not the slightest trace of a grin.
After watching today's match, doesn't it feel\nlike Brazil's teamwork is a bit questionable?
I wonder why.
Is it their team policy to push through relying\non individual skill to cover the gaps?
Maybe they're nervous?
Supposedly they were assembled last minute,\nafter training with their own teams back in\nBrazil. Maybe this is the obvious result of that.
So they haven't practiced\nenough as a team then...?
After seeing how brute force that\nperformance was, you might be right.
Still, up against a better opponent,\neven Brazil would have a tough time.
So you think it's a mental issue\nthen? Makes sense though.
Yeah, Brazil's got one heck of a reputation\nto live up to. I can't imagine the pressure.
...
(Brazil might not have their teamwork down yet,\nbut that's not uncommon for strong countries.\nIf they keep advancing, they'll figure it out.)
(But their ace, Carlos Bara...)
(He's an amazing player with both athleticism and\nprecise technique. Even compared to the other\nBrazilians, he's a cut above.)
(What an amazing player with that power and\ntechnique... Compared to the other players, he's\non another level.)
(But it's so strange... When I watch him play,\nhe doesn't seem the least bit excited.)
(Like I can't see any emotion from him...\nlike he's a soccer-playing robot.)
(I learned my love of soccer from Roberto,\nwho wore Brazil's number 10.)
(How can someone wearing that same number from\nthe same country be so completely different?)
Preliminaries D Block, Germany vs. Portugal
Germany... We still need to\nget our payback on them.
(Let's see how you fare, Schneider.)
Germany vs. Portugal is about to reach the end\nof the first half, but we can safely say that this\nis Germany's game to lose!
Schester and Kaltz have perfect control of the\nmidfield, not giving Portugal a chance to even\ntouch the ball!
Meanwhile on the front lines, Heine supplies the\nball to Margus and Schneider while they produce\ngoal after goal!
And here it comes again! Heine\nhas passed the ball to Schneider!
And it's in! Schneider's Fire Shot\nmakes it in for a hat trick!
That's Germany's Young Emperor for\nyou! The name's not just for show!
Do you guys know why that\nshot's called the Fire Shot?
Hmmm?
For its speed and power.
Because it's literally on fire.
Cuz it sounds awesome!
Yeah, they use the term "fireball"\nback in Japan all the time, don't they?
A lot of people assume that... but it's not true.
No way, that's just dumb.
No, <avatar_name> is right.
Seriously?
Yeah, the image of a ball on fire\nis just awesome. It sounds strong\nand spooks the opposing team too.
Well, that'd be cute... if it were true.
You can't see it with the naked eye,\nbut the Fire Shot really does burn.
Y-You're kidding!
I don't know if it's the friction between the\nball and the air, the cleats and the ball when\nit's kicked, or between the ball and the net.
But either way, after he scores a goal with it,\nthere's the faint smell of something burning left\nbehind.
That's where it gets its name. Schneider's\nFire Shot. Some say... unstoppable.
Unstoppable, huh?
And that's the game!
Germany was completely untouchable!\nThey've won their first game!
With Schneider and Margus up front, Schester and\nKaltz serving as volantes, and Heine making\nplays...
Their formation combined offense and defense into\nseamless, flawless play! Just what you'd expect\nfrom the number one favorite to win!
Karl Heinz Schneider... If you want to\nbe the best striker in the world, Hyuga,\nhe's who you have to beat.
Yeah.
(That Fire Shot today was a little different from\nthe one before in both spin and extension.)
(Don't tell me...)
All-Japan Junior Youth Team After Training
Hey, didn't Wakabayashi seem\nkinda quiet in practice today?
Yeah, it was kinda eerie.
Now that you mention it, he\ndid seem to be spacing out.
Maybe I said too much, earlier.
Eh, would he really get upset over that?\nHe doesn't seem like that kinda guy.
...
Wakabayashi.
Oh, it's Misugi and <avatar_name>.
You looked like you were thinking about something\nduring practice. Is something wrong?
...Can you two do me a favor?
Huh?
Could you make some time to train with me tonight?
Sure thing.
We're supposed to be studying...
We've got a study group tonight, so it'll\nhave to be pretty late. That okay with you?
Yeah, that's fine. Thanks.
Got it.
Oh, right.
Between the study group tonight and the match in\nthe morning, I don't think I can make it...
Oh... don't worry about it.\nSorry for being a bother.
I wonder what that was about...
Morning, <avatar_name>.\nSorry for waking you up so early.
Actually, I'm going to be doing some\ntraining this morning. Wanna come with?
Sure, let's go!
Sorry, sleep is too precious!
Great! I'll be waiting by the entrance!
Ooh, it's Takeshi and <avatar_name>!\nYou're here, too?
Good morning!
Alright, let's get this started!
Man... Worked up a good sweat.
Doing free training together with\neveryone sure is a nice change of pace.
Plus, we came all this way, so it'd\nbe a waste not to work together.
That's for sure. Training with different people\nthan you normally do you pick up a lot!
Whoops, looks like it's almost time\nfor breakfast. We'd better head back.
Then let's hurry and get everything picked up!
Okay!





Oh, really? Sorry for waking\nyou up, man. Get some rest.
Okay, we'll split up into two\ngroups and have a mini-match.
<avatar_name>, you'll be in the sub group.
What? You're putting him in the sub group?
Yeah. Now hurry up.
Y-Yessir!
Well, you heard him. Make\nsure you don't get rusty.
That Night
Sorry for doing this so late, <avatar_name>.
Could you come with me for a sec?
Here we go!
Hey, over here!
Not gettin' past me!
No way we're losing!
Nice defense!
This is when Germany's reserve members practice.
I've worked as a coach in Germany for a long time\nnow. I know these players. And they're good.
So why are they being benched?
I don't really see it.
You should know why.
It's because of how unbelievably\ngood the regulars are. How far\nbeyond these players they are.
Should I take that as evidence of\nhow much better you are now?
Anyway, it's because of how unbelievably good the\nregulars are. How far out of reach they are.
To be frank, these guys will never see play,\nshort of a regular sustaining a major injury.
But they're fine with waiting for that\nchance, and they want to be ready for it.
That's not the only reason they're\nworking so hard, though.
It's so they can go pro in the future, or be\nchosen as full representatives, or play in the\nWorld Cup.
And so they can beat their rivals, who\nare competing for the same dreams.
It's the same for Japan. Everyone's\nworking towards their own dreams.
And it's the same for you too. If you keep it up,\nyou'll surpass them in no time. You're no less\ntalented than they are, after all.
Okay, everybody listen up.
Today's opponent is Senegal. They're a fast\nteam that makes good use of its athleticism.
Their quick forwards will dash past our defense,\nwhile their midfield, Senghor, sends a long ball\ntheir way. That's their basic strategy.
We'll lose if try to outrun them, so we'll have\nour defense go for an offside trap. The goalie\nwill have to cover all the space that opens up.
Senegal also likes to use a lot of heading. Try\nto put a lot of power into your jumps so we\ndon't lose the ball to them that way.
Sounds good!







Still, we've seen weaknesses in their defense\nin their matches with the Netherlands and Italy.
Overall, they may be faster but we've\ngot better technique and coordination.
So I want you to be confident out there!
Racja!




They've already lost twice, so there's no way\nthey're making it past the prelims, right?
And we've already beaten Italy and the\nNehterlands, so this should be a freebie.
That's right! There's no reason for us not to win!
Carelessness is our biggest enemy.
Yeah, let's take it easy and just do what we do.
Tak! Let's go get this done!
He's right. No team here is so bad\nthat we can afford to get careless.
Letting your guard down for even a moment\ncan mean all the difference in soccer.
Ha, yeah, just some light training to mix it up!
Listen up, guys!
What is it, Tsubasa?
I feel like some of you think this isn't\nimportant, since we're getting into the finals\neither way.
But our goal is to be the best in the world.
When we get to the finals tournament, no doubt\neven fiercer matches will be waiting for us. We\ncan't afford to let our focus slip at any point.
He's right. Once you relax, it's a lot harder\nto back in the zone than you'd think.
So I want us to take this match seriously.\nWe'll give it everything we've got and win!
Alright? We'll ride the momentum\nstraight into the finals!
You got it!




For us, this is the final game of the tournament.
I'm sorry... If only I'd done better\nto bring out everyone's best...
What are you talking about? This isn't your fault!
This is all because of our coach! He can only\ncome up with the simplest strategies. There's no\nway we'd win at this level with him guiding us!
Am I wrong, Senghor?
I-I guess I have to agree...
Okay, good, everyone's already here.
...
...
Today's opponent is Japan, who are riding\nhigh after winning their first two games.
But their physical abilities are\nnothing special. In other words,\nthey're the perfect opponent for us!
Today's the day we earn back some\nrespect for Senegal's high-speed soccer!
...
...
What do you say?
...Yes, sir.
...
...
Senghor, what about our players sets us apart?
That's... Our legs. Running and jumping.
Right. So then, as the weakest player on\nthe team but our number one technician...
What do you think your role is here?
To bring out the best in my\nteammates. To be the playmaker.
Exactly. And that's why I came up with this plan.
B-But...
You got a problem with it?
N-No, sir...
...Does he seriously believe that?
Diallo!
Senghor, as captain it's\nyour job to rally the team!
Y-Yes, sir!
O-Okay guys, I know this is our... our last game,\nbut I want us to play hard right up to the end!
Good. That's enough.
Now, I'll be heading up to the benches first.
Why don't you speak up for yourself, Senghor?
Why are you so timid?
B-But the coach is right.\nEveryone else is so amazing.
If only I could draw that out, I know we'd win!
So let's do our best out there!
Senghor...
This is the third match of the\nprelims, Japan against Senegal!
After beating both Italy and the Netherlands,\nJapan is already headed to the finals.
However, Senegal has two losses and\nis guaranteed a ticket home after this match.
The contrast between their situations\ncouldn't be more extreme!
Will Japan get a third win to build up momentum\nfor the finals tournament? Or will Senegal finally\nshow us some ferocity?
We're moments away from the kickoff!
You're the captain? Let's have a good match!
Y-Yeah. Same to you.
I hope to learn a lot from this!
Learn? What are you talking about? Both\nteams have to go all out if we want to\nmake this match memorable!
(We've been with you from the beginning, Senghor.\nWe know better than anyone just how amazing you\nreally are.)
(You're a world-class player.\nOne hundred percent!)
(And we're going to make you shine!)
Let's get a third straight win,\nguys!
Tak! Let's win this!
Can we really win? We have to\ntry!
You expect us to just roll\nover and die?!
Let's do this, Senghor!
Y-Yeah! I'm counting on you!
I-I knew it. It's hopeless...
Nice one, Senghor!
I-I won...?
Was that the French technique?
I-I won't lose!
Wh-What flexible technique!
Th-This player is good!
I won't lose when it comes to\ntechnique!
I-I won! Somehow...
I-I won?!
No way, he's just too good!
W-We're doomed! With that offside trap,\nI can't drop long balls to the forwards!
When it comes to heading,\nI'm the best around!
I can't keep up on the ground,\nbut when we get in the air...!
Just watch me soar!
Just watch me soar!
Seriously, who is this guy?
We're not going down that\neasy!
We can still make it!
And there's the whistle for the first half!
Looks like Japan hasn't lost any\nsteam from their first two wins!
They're well on their way to three straight\nwins after taking the lead over Senegal.
And there's the whistle for the first half!
It may be two wins squaring off against two\nlosses, but Senegal's putting up a great fight!
Still, we haven't seen everything from Japan\nyet either! The second half will be exciting!
And there's the whistle for the first half!
Japan may have come into this with two wins\nunder their belt, but Senegal's been running\ncircles around them!
Still, Japan should be more prepared going into\nthe second half. Look out for a comeback!
Great work out there. Keep it up.
Racja!





I didn't know what to think about a team\nspecializing in speed, but after seeing\nthis, it's not so impressive.
That just shows how much we've gotten\nused to world-class play and speed.
Got a minute, Tsubasa?
What is it?
I wanted to ask your what your impressions\nwere from when you clashed with Senghor.
Hmmm... Let me think...
I guess I'd say Senghor doesn't have the same\nincredible strength of the other players.
But instead, his ball control is stellar. It's\nhard to put this into words, but it's like he's\nnot really putting all of himself into it.
I see. Thanks.
Got a minute, Misaki?
I wanted to ask your what your impressions\nwere from when you clashed with Senghor.
With him? Let's see...
I felt like his technique was\nsimilar to French players.
Plus, it felt like he was always keeping\nan eye on his teammates and really\nconcentrating on every action.
I see. Thanks.
(But something's bugging me.)
(It's not hard for us to deal with\nSenegal's straightforward playstyle.)
(But that Senghor guy is a wild card. His\ntechnique seems light-years ahead of\nthe rest of the team.)
(If he started to use it more proactively, and\nwork with his teammates too, the situation\ncould could turn on a dime.)
Got a minute, <avatar_name>?
Could you tell me your impressions\nfrom clashing with Senghor?
He lacked power.
He had surprisingly good technique.
He had a timid look in his eyes.
True, compared to his teammates he didn't\nhave as much strength to his movements.
But from what I could tell he\nmade up for it in technique.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
That gentle touch with the ball and his control\nwhile passing may not be flashy, but there's\namazing talent there.
Really?
So the reason he's always so passive\ndespite his incredible technique is\nbecause of his personality?
(It's not hard for us to deal with\nSenegal's straightforward playstyle.)
(But that Senghor guy is a wild card.\nHis technique seems light-years ahead\nof the rest of the team.)
(If he started to use it more proactively, and\nwork with his teammates too, the situation\ncould could turn on a dime.)
What the heck are you guys doing out there?!
...
We completely overwhelm them\nin physical ability! Isn't it your job\nto make things happen, Senghor?!
I-I'm sorry, sir...
...I've had enough of this!
What?
Stop blaming the players for\nyour own lousy strategies!
Wha-?! What did you just say?!
Are you deaf? I'll say it again! We can't win\nwith your empty-headed concept of soccer!
H-Hey, Diallo...
Just step back! This is my last chance to say it!
Coach! We're sick of doing things your way!
All you do is take your own prejudices and\nyour own style, and force them on us!
H-How dare you!
We can do more than that! We have\nour own soccer we wanna play!
What are you talking about?\nWith your underdeveloped technique,\nthis is the only way you can...
If that's what you think, then you\nhaven't been paying attention!
Right guys?
Tak!
Diallo's right!
We're not stupid, y'know!
All of you...?!
This is our last match anyway, so\nwe're going to play how we want!
Senghor, use us in your plans in the second half.
Wh-What?!
You've been following our\nlead this whole time, right?
Well, now it's your turn!\nYou lead and we'll follow!
With your technique and eye for strategy,\nI know you'll make better use of us!
Absolutely! Just play like how\nyou do in our training matches!
B-But...
We've been playing soccer together since\nwe were little, Senghor. We know your\nstrengths better than anyone.
You're not like us... because you're\nincredible! So show some pride!
This is our last chance, so let's\nshow them what we can really do!
Diallo...
...
I understand. If you all believe in me so much...
Then, I'll give it my best.
Senghor!
Alright guys, let's do this "just like always"!
Couldn't have said it better!



Let's show the world how amazing our captain is!
Good work out there. Just keep it up and fight\nfor the rest of the second half. I know if you\ndo that the rest of the game will go our way.
Yessir!





So this is what a team specialized in speed is\nlike, huh? They're like nothing we've ever faced.
Seriously, I thought we'd be used to top-notch\nspeed by now, but they took it up another notch.
If it's just a couple of steps we can still\nmanage, but when they start sprinting,\nit's like trying to run down a cheetah.
If even Nitta is saying that, we probably\nshouldn't focus on competing in speed.
Got a minute, Tsubasa?
What is it?
I wanted to ask your what your impressions\nwere from when you clashed with Senghor.
Hmm, let's see...
I guess I'd say Senghor doesn't have the same\nincredible strength of the other players.
But instead, his ball control is stellar. It's\nhard to put this into words, but it's like he's\nnot really putting all of himself into it.

With him? Let me think...
I felt like his technique was\nsimilar to French players.
Plus, it felt like he was always keeping\nan eye on his teammates and really\nconcentrating on every action.
I see. Thanks.
(Their speed is definitely amazing.\nBut something else is bugging me.)
(So far, Senegal's soccer has been\npretty straightforward, yet we're\nalready struggling this much.)
(But that Senghor guy is a wild card.\nHis technique seems light-years ahead\nof the rest of the team.)
(If he started to use it more proactively, and\nwork with his teammates too, the situation could\ncould turn on a dime.)
Good job, guys. You did fine.
Just keep pushing them back with brute strength!
Is it really okay to go on like this?
H-Hey, Diallo...
You got something to say?
I mean, yes, your strategy is going well for now,\nbut that's just because Japan is a perfect fit for\nit.
Plus, they're definitely going to come up with\nsomething for the next half. And when that\nhappens, we're just going to lose again.
What are you saying?
Coach, I don't think we can continue to play this\nway. We've come as far as we can on this strategy.
Wh-What was that? What did you just say?!
Are you deaf? I'll say it again! We can't win\nwith your empty-headed concept of soccer!
Calm down, Diallo!
Just step back! This is my last chance to say it!
We're sick of doing things your way, Coach!
All you do is take your own prejudices and\nyour own style, and force them on us!
H-How dare you!
We can do more than that!\nSo why won't you let us try?
Ha, more than that? What are you talking about?
With your underdeveloped technique,\nthis is the only way you can--
If that's what you think, then you\nhaven't been paying attention!
Right guys?
Tak!
Diallo's right!
We're not stupid, y'know!
All of you...?!
This is our last chance to test ourselves against\nthe world. So we're gonna play how we want!
Senghor, use us in your plans in the second half.
Wh-What?!
You've been following our\nlead this whole time, right?
Well, now it's your turn!\nYou lead and we'll follow!
With your technique and eye for strategy,\nI know you'll make better use of us!
Absolutely! Just play like how\nyou do in our training matches!
B-But...
We've been playing soccer together since\nwe were little, Senghor. We know your\nstrengths better than anyone.
You're not like us... because you're\nincredible! So show some pride!
Let's show the world what we can really do!
Diallo...
...
I understand. If you all believe in me so much...
Then, I'll give it my best.
Senghor!
Alright guys, let's do this "just like always"!
Couldn't have said it better!



Let's show the world how amazing our captain is!
(For some reason, my legs are feeling numb after\nclashing with Senegal's number 10. This is the\nfirst time that's happened.)
(Don't tell me he has some kinda hidden\nstrength he's been holding back?)
...
We're about to hear the whistle\nfor the start of the second half.
Can Japan keep its lead and come out of the\npreliminaries with three straight wins?
We're about to hear the whistle\nfor the start of the second half.
Both teams were evenly matched in the first half,\nso which one will take the first point and seize\ncontrol here in the second?
We're about to hear the whistle\nfor the start of the second half.
Japan's given up the lead, but can they use the\nremaining time to turn this around? Or will\nSenegal seize their first win?
Keep moving around me,\neveryone!
I want to have as many passing\nlanes as possible.
Sure thing!




What incredible skill!
I-I won't lose!
Holy cow! What amazing\ntechnique!
My technique will surpass all\nothers!
Evenly matched in technique,\nhuh?
D-Did you see that? That's my\ntechnique!
It's not working!
But I have to win...!
Alright! I won!
I knew it, I'm just no good...
Senghor! Can you pass it harder?
Huh?
I could, but... with you all running so\nfast, your bodies would give out!
Don't worry about us! We'll make up\nfor the fatigue with spirit! Right guys?
You know it!



I want you to take it all the way to full-power!\nAnd we'll show you how serious we can be, too!
Okay...I understand. Then we'll launch\ninto it right when the match restarts!
Tak!




Here we go, guys!
Tak!




Senegal has switched into high gear!
We did it, Senghor!
Yeah, nice goal!
Alright guys, there's more where that came\nfrom! Senghor's just hitting his groove!
We're just getting started! This isn't even\nclose to what we're fully capable of!
Alright!



They... How'd they do that...?
(I knew it. That Senghor guy\nhas insane technique.)
(Plus, as the team's leader he can\ndraw out the best in his teammates.)
(But I'm just...)
Takeshi!
Sorimachi?
You're no slouch either, bud. I would know.
You took Toho Academy to the National finals when\nHyuga was gone. You gave us our first victory at\nNationals.
And back in Toho Academy, you were the one who\nset up my goals. You're an amazing playmaker.
Prove it on the pitch. Don't let people forget.
Make the last pass to me, Takeshi.
I may not be as good as Hyuga, but I'm a forward\non the best team in Japan! I can make it count\nwhen I need to.
Okay, let's give it a shot!
That's what I like to hear!
(At first glance, it looks like the playmaker\nSenghor is working hard to highlight the\ntalents of his teammates.)
(But it's actually the other way around. That\nforward, Diallo, is desperately struggling to\ndraw out Senghor's potential.)
(You're the best playmaker\nI've ever played with, Takeshi.)
(So I'm going to help you be the best you can be.)
If anyone can do it, it's you Takeshi!
You don't think it'll work?
We'll even show Tsubasa a thing or two!
Thanks, <avatar_name>...
Alright, let's give it a shot!
N-No! I do!
Nobody knows Sorimachi's strengths better than me!
Huh? I mean, I wouldn't go THAT far...
...But if it's Sorimachi, maybe it can work.
That's the spirit, Takeshi!
(At first glance, it looks like the playmaker\nSenghor is working hard to highlight the\ntalents of his teammates.)
(But it's actually the other way around. That\nforward, Diallo, is desperately struggling to\ndraw out Senghor's potential.)
(You're the best playmaker\nI've ever played with, Takeshi.)
(So I'm going to help you be the best you can be.)
Alright, here goes nothing!
On it!
Nice shot! Just what I'd expect from\na forward on the best team in Japan!
No no no, that was only because of your pass.\nThat's what one expects from a playmaker who\ndominated Nationals.
That number 15 is good. He set\nthat up perfectly for number 19.
And that's not all. Number 19 was working\nwith 15 to create that position, too.
We'd better keep up then!
Yeah, we can play even harder!
Man, they're just too fast!
Keep it together! \nJust get the ball back!
(Senegal, the way you're playing now with\neveryone coming together for the captain...\nIt takes me back to Furano MS.)
(But that's exactly why I can't lose! As\na representative of Furano, and of Japan,\nI know a thing or two about teamwork!)
Let's make it happen, guys!
What's this? Matsuyama started\ndribbling forward at a rapid pace!
It's a counter-offensive! Get back to our side!
Tak!




Oof, they're too fast! They're already back!
Not a problem! Not even\nSenegal can outrun my kick!
Huh?
Here we go! Tsubasa! Hyuga! It's coming to you!
Matsuyama!


Here, Tsubasa!
What speed! It's like an eagle\nflying low over the field!
And Tsubasa traps the ball! But Senegal's\ndefense is already forming a wall!
Hyuga!
What skill from Tsubasa! A Drive Spin powered\npass bulldozes through Senegal's wall!
And the ball is heading to Hyuga! Is it time for\nus to see the sparks fly as he takes a shot?
Like we'd let that happen!


But Senegal is too fast! They're\nalready encroaching on Hyuga!
Over here, Hyuga!
Soda...? Gotcha!
Hyuga turns his body and lets loose a\npass no less fierce than any of his shots!
What was that?!
Heh... Like that? Thought you\nmight enjoy something new.
Not today!
Diallo is rushing Soda!
Don't underestimate my Razor!
I'll take that!
What?!
Soda's ball has curved sharply and\nvanished right from in front of Diallo!
You're up, Matsuyama!
Matsuyama is sprinting to take Soda's pass!
(This is it! I've trained long\nand hard for this day!)
I'll... I'll intercept it!
Senghor is also dashing for the\nball! Who will reach it first?!
Not happening!
I can't lose now!
And Matsuyama's shot shakes the net!
Japan's masterful passing has dumbfounded\nSenegal! And the final pass was to the player\nwho started it all, Matsuyama!
Good call, Matsuyama!
I was thinking a play like that could come in\nhandy since the scrimmages, but that went\nbetter than I'd expected.
But seriously Hyuga, could you send me\npasses that aren't going to take my limbs\noff? My leg's still numb from trapping it.
Hmph. I guess I'm just not good enough.\nBetter get used to it, cuz all my passes\nare gonna be like that.
You're kidding...
Hah, well...



I'm so sorry, if only I'd\nstopped that last pass...
What are you talking about? We couldn't stop\nthem either. The team wins together, and we\nlose together.
Yeah, don't let it eat at you like that, Senghor.
Anyway, let's get back into gear!\nThe match ain't over yet!
Yeah, you're right.
And that's the game!
The All-Japan Junior Youths get their third win,\ncoming out on top in the preliminary matches!
This isn't just momentum carrying\nthem! This is genuine skill, folks!
And that's the game!
The All-Japan Junior Youth team ties with Senegal!
They'd hoped to carry their momentum\nnto the finals, but it wasn't to be!
And that's the game!
Senegal defeats the All-Japan Junior Youths\nto redeem themselves after two losses!
Forget about momentum going into the finals!\nThese results seem a dark omen for Japan.
Sorry guys... You put so much faith\nin me, but I couldn't pull out a win.
Eh, don't worry about it. This\ngame wasn't that important.
Diallo...
We weren't going to progress in the tournament\neither way. Even if we'd won, what would it\nmatter?
More importantly, you kicked butt out there!\nEven the Japanese players were stunned!
Y-You think?
But I guess maybe I feel more confident now. Like\nmy technique can cut it with world-class teams.
Sheesh, haven't you been paying attention?\nIt's not just your technique, you know.
You're the only one in the world who can makes\npasses that accurate or give commands that make\nsuch great use of our speed.
Yeah, Diallo's right!
We could only play such amazing\nsoccer because of you, Senghor!
I bet the rest of the world sees that now, too.
Th-That's a bit much...
If we can play like we did this last\nhalf, we can take on the world.
And you're the only playmaker who could keep up!\nWe've got a bright future in store, Senghor!
Thank you so much, guys...
I'll do my best too! I want to support\nyou and keep playing together.
So... Thank you!
Yeah, let's take on the world, together!
(I was wrong...)
(I didn't really see my players\nfor who they were, and I forced\nthem into a mold that didn't fit.)
(I never let them play the way they wanted to\nplay. I should have paid better attention and\nguided them.)
(After seeing that second half... Your\nsoccer is really something special, boys.)
(I have no doubt that it'll be your deeds\nthat pen the next chapter in the history\nof Senegalese soccer.)
(And I can't wait to see it...)
We did it, Tsubasa! Three straight wins!
Mmhmm...
What's up?
Winning is great and all, but they were\nreally driving us back in the second half.
Yeah, they found some real\nextra-strength get up and go.
Their team really came together. Calling 'em\n"tough" doesn't even begin to cover it.
It looked like the whole team put their\nfull faith in their captain, and worked\ntogether through that shared vision.
Yeah, it was like his teammates were elevating\nhim, while at the same time he was pushing himself\nto live up to their expectations.
The most important thing to have in soccer\nisn't power, technique, or even speed.
We have to be a team that works as a single unit.\nWe have to be a team that makes each other better.
It's so obvious, but I feel like I'm relearning\nthis aspect of the game all over again.
Never forget your roots, huh?
Nice match, Tsubasa! Thanks!
Same to you! I learned a lot today!
Huh? Didn't you say it shouldn't be\nabout learning before the match?
I was mistaken.
And Sawada and Sorimachi!
Yeah?
I'll never forget the way you two\nbrought out the best in each other.
That's our line. Coming up against Senegalese\nsoccer has really been educational.
Glad to hear it.
I hope we can play again sometime.
Absolutely!
Well, good luck in the finals!\nWe'll be cheering you on!
Thanks!
<avatar_name>, your pass was amazing!\nIt was on a totally different level from mine!
You'll hafta teach me the trick some time. I'm\ngoing to keep getting better, and I'll be ready\nfor you next time.
Your pass was brilliant! You demonstrated\nsuch amazing control, speed, timing...!
Senegal doesn't have any more games this\ntournament, but I look forward to an exchange\nof skill at the earliest opportunity.
Well, good luck in the finals!\nWe'll be cheering you on!
Thanks!
I had a feeling you weren't ordinary, but after\nseeing you shut down our sprints so easily,\nI'm certain.
But just you wait. Next time, I'll be a speed\ndemon with monstrous technique to boot,\nand it'll make your head spin!
No ordinary players could put\nthe kibosh on our speed like that.
But thanks to you, we realized what we were\nmissing. Guess we'll just have to return the favor\nnext time!
Well, good luck in the finals!\nWe'll be cheering you on!
Thanks!
After the Japan vs. Senegal Match
It's the final match of the preliminaries,\nBlock A! Italy vs. the Netherlands is\nabout to start!
Both teams have 3 victory points so far, but due\nto the total goals, the Netherlands only need a\ntie to advance, while Italy absolutely must win.
The Dutch team definitely has an\nedge, but this is sure to be exciting!
The soul of our soccer is in our offense.
We're not some boring team that could\nbe sated with a draw. Let's crush them!
Obviously!





Our opponents will definitely come in hard and\nfast, which means this is the perfect match-up for\nus.
There's always a path to\nvictory. Let's blaze one now!
Heck yeah!




Rusciano.
I know, I know... Stop buggin'\nme. I'm trying to focus here.
My bad.
...
And the match began.
As expected, the Dutch team went on the\noffense while Italy tightened its defenses.
The Dutch offense crashed down on Italy like a\ntsunami, but thanks to Hernandez's brilliant saves\nthey were unable to score.
Then, twenty-four minutes into the first half...
That's a foul for the Netherlands!\nThat means a penalty kick!
This is Italy's first counterattack\nafter weathering an unrelenting\nassault from the Netherlands!
The Dutch defense just couldn't resist\ntripping Rusciano within the penalty area.
Conti will be taking the kick!
And it's in! Italy takes the lead!
With that, Italy's defensive play\nwill likely dominate the match!
Hey, Rusciano, why'd you let me take the kick?
What? You got your time in the\nspotlight, so why're you complaining?
...Are you just not good at penalty kicks?
Leave off!
Now that they have the first point,\nItaly enters its catenaccio formation.
However, it seems to have been premature.
After Italy drew back, the Dutch offense got to\nwork, quickly exhausting the defensive line.
And then, sixteen minutes into the second half...
The Netherlands finally even the score!
After finding an opening in the defense using\nswift passes, Kluivoort shook his pursuers just\nlong enough to make a play!
Hernandez tried to block the shot, but\neven the Golden Right Hand wasn't quite enough!
Nice one, Kluivoort!
There's still work to do. We're only tied.\nWe need another one before time runs out.
It's not over until it's over, guys! Just\nkeep holding out until our chance comes!
Tak!




Afterward, the Netherlands continued on the\noffensive, just as Kluivoort said they needed to.
On the other side, Italy was reinvigorated by\nHernandez's words of encouragement, and\nkept their defensive fortress intact.
However, with only two minutes to go, maintaining\nthe defense had pushed Italy's legs beyond their\nlimits.
And then...
And it's another opportunity for the\nNetherlands! Kaiser has the ball and\nis moving fast down the sideline!
Rensen!
And Kaiser passes it to Lensenblink\non the opposite side of the field!
Klismann!
Lensenblink sends it back to\nKlismann waiting in midfield!
Italy's defense is being sent on a\nwild goose chase all over the field!
Now, Kluivoort!
And what's this? Klismann sends a\nthrough pass straight to Kluivoort!
Kluivoort is deep behind enemy lines!
It's a one-on-one with the goalie now!
(Kluivoort always aims for my right.)
(It's my fault we're tied,\nso I can't let another by me.)
(I'll stop this shot even if it breaks my arm!)
Your right arm is done!
Kluivoort makes a point blank shot on the goal!
Don't you dare underestimate\nItaly or the strength of my Golden Right Hand!
Ngh!
Im-Impossible!
H-He caught it! Hernandez has\nmade a last second miracle save!
The Dutch players were so sure of the\ngoal that they're standing slack-jawed!
Now!
Hernandez spurs his team\ninto a speedy counterattack!
And the ball goes to...
Rusciano, waiting in the midfield! This is\nItaly's final chance for a counterattack!
Finally! You know how long I've waited for this?
Oh no! Pull back!
Rusciano advances on his own! But waiting\nfor him are three Dutch defenders!
You're not getting through us!
Ha! As if trash like you could even slow me down!
We'll see about that!
Th-This is it! What beautiful\njuggling technique from Rusciano!
Even swarmed by Dutch defenders, he continues\nmoving the ball with skill and vigor, refusing to\nsurrender! It's almost like he's dancing!
This jerk... He's mocking us!
You like that, kiddies?
(Great job, Dirk. You bought enough\ntime for me to make it back.)
While Rusciano was unable to advance, Kluivoort\nsprinted all the way back to the goal!
(It's not what I wanted, but I guess we'll settle\nfor a draw. Now let's get that ball back!)
Kluivoort approaches Rusciano from behind!
Oh!
What's this?! Maybe it was nerves from seeing the\napproaching Kluivoort, but Rusciano has missed his\nkick!
The ball's flying up and drawing an arc\nacross the sky! Is this the end for Italy?!
Maybe not! Another player's running in!
It's Tardelli! Now right in front of the goal!
(No! So that was their plan?)
(We weren't the ones buying time, they were!\nHe was waiting for a teammate to get up here!)
All the Dutch players are focused on\nRusciano! Tardelli is completely clear!
Have a taste of this!
It's a nasty looking Heading Shot!
And... it's in! Italy scores a last\nsecond goal to win the game!
Thanks to Rusciano's unparalleled play, Tardelli\nmanaged to take position and put the ball cleanly\ninto the Dutch goal!
The Dutch team's hopes have been\ncrushed with mere moments to go.
Standing among them with his chest held high\nis Rusciano! Truly, the play of a fantasista!
You see that? This is my...
Our...
Italy's soccer!
Italy's soccer!


And that's the game!
Italy versus the Netherlands! A pitched battle\nending in a dramatic victory for Italy! They're\nadvancing to the finals of the tournament!
The Italian team is huddling\naround their MVP, Rusciano!
You did it! You did it, Rusciano!
Hey, stop grabbing me! Go hug Zino!
That was amazing, Rusciano!
C'mon, not you too.
We only won today because of you.
What's the big deal?
Ugh...!
Er... is your arm supposed to\nhang like that? You all right?
Kluivoort's last shot did this.\nProbably broke two or three fingers.
And you're just standing\nthere? Go see a doctor.
Later. For now, I want to celebrate with you guys.
I mean, if you think you'll be okay...
What, you're leaving already?
How many times do I gotta tell you?\nI'm not here to make friends.
C'mon, at least let me get a high five.
I hate this kinda thing.
Now seriously, get to a hospital, ya big idiot.
...
Frustrated, Kluivoort?
Yeah...
...
Coach...
What?
We... are we even able to get\nany better than we are now?
There's always a way.
First, you need strict training, to hone\nboth your bodies and your abilities.
At the same time, you need to study up on more\nstrategies and plays. Learn the theory and then\ntry it out on the field.
And then, once you've got the experience and the\nskills, the team needs to come together--find a\nshared vision of what the team is and wants.
Once the team breathes as if it's one\nbeing, Dutch soccer will become\nunbeatable. We call that...
Ultimate Formation
That's right.
But the road there is long and demanding.\nEven talented boys like you might not make it.
Do you still feel like making the journey?
Yes, Coach.
Great. Then we'll do everything in\nour power to help you get there.
(With that resolve, I know\nyou can make it, Kluivoort.)
(The future of soccer in the\nNetherlands starts right here.)
Once again, good work making it through the\npreliminaries with a perfect win record.
To be perfectly honest, I never\nexpected you guys to make it this far.
I figured I could take a vacation\nafter you lost three times.
Hey, that's just mean, Coach!
Hahaha!





I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
But you've really improved. I wasn't so sure how\nyou'd do after the scrimmages with America and\nGermany.
It's all because everyone's worked\nso hard to improve the team.
Yeah, we can keep up with the other teams now,\nand with every game our bond grows stronger.
And we've still got room to grow.
Sure, we're better now, but we got to\nkeep our eyes on the top of the mountain.
I don't need you to tell me that.
Hmm? What's going on outside?
Katagiri.
America and France just finished their game.
Who won?
France. Overwhelmingly.
You don't say.
So France ran all over Blake, Azwan, and the rest?
They're that good, huh?
No, Blake and Azwan weren't in today's match.
Huh?
Well, both teams were already guaranteed\nto advance, so perhaps they were simply\nletting them rest.
But France came out in full force. Against\nAmerica's reserve members, it wasn't\nmuch of a show.
I'm sure France is a still a little bitter that\nAmerica stole their tournament. Oh, well...
(But if America clears the preliminaries in\nsecond place, it's very likely that they'll face\nGermany in the opening match of the finals.)
(It would've been far more advantageous\nfor them to come in first.)
(I just can't understand why\nthey'd throw this game away...)
Well, that makes sense. I can\nunderstand France being a little spiteful.
I get the whole "it doesn't matter if we lose"\nthing, but something seems off about it.
I know what you mean. In the\nend, soccer's about winning.
Exactly. Especially for challengers\nlike us. Each and every match\nprovides valuable experience.
While of course each match of the preliminaries\nwas serious, your opponents in the finals will be\nlike nothing you've faced.
So you don't have time to celebrate.\nIt's time to focus, focus, focus!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Racja!
Hyah!
Again, Tsubasa!
On it!
Not a bad kick compared to how you started.
Yeah, I feel like my legs\nare quite a bit stronger.
(But this isn't enough. I'm\nstill missing something...)
Alright, my turn!
You really are strong, Hyuga...\nI can't kick it like that.
You need the leg strength for sure, but there's\nactually a trick to kicking a heavy ball.
You can't just kick it haphazardly. You need to\nfocus on form to kick it with the full strength of\nyour legs.
The right form, huh?
Hyah!
Ooh! Not bad.
...
What's wrong, Tsubasa?
That's it! That's it, Hyuga!
What's what now? Did you figure it out?
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
Then just keep practicing. You can do it, Tsubasa.
Thanks, Hyuga.
So the prelims are over?
Right. Other than us, the remaining teams are\nItaly, France, America, Brazil, Argentina,\nGermany, and Uruguay.
So it ended up like this anyway,\nregardless of the brackets.
Still, I was surprised by Brazil's match against\nArgentina. Argentina didn't use Diaz.
I assumed that since both countries are\nrivals, they'd be sending their best line-ups.
That just goes to show how serious Argentina\nis about winning the whole shebang.
With three more games to go before the finals,\nthey're giving their ace a day to rest so he can\nplay his best when it matters most.
Also, by getting second\nplace in the preliminaries...
They'll be matched up with us. No doubt\nan "easy win" from their perspective.
So they think that little of us after all...
But that's fine by me. If anything, that gives us\nan edge when they let their guards down.
True.
With Tsubasa at the center, our players have\nimproved. As they are now, they may just be\nready to take on the world.
It's amazing how fast kids can grow.\nEvery day they surprise me.
And being responsible for their growth,\nwe have to man our respective posts.
Right. We'd better hurry up and begin the\nanalysis of their next opponent, Argentina.
The All-Japan Junior Youth Team\nBefore Practice
Okay boys, get to training.
Wait, can I say something first?
What is it?
There's something I'd like to give\nto everyone before practice.
These are the notes I've been taking on what\nI see as everyone's strong points and\nweaknesses to work on.
Also, I thought up a few formations based\non my experience playing in Europe.
I don't mind if you skim through it,\nbut be sure to give it a look, alright?
Wh-When did you have time to make all these?
Misugi and <avatar_name> have been helping me out,\nand we finally put it all together last night.
We worked all night on these.
I learned a lot doing this.
Sorry it took us so long.
But I think they turned out pretty well.
Me too. Putting it all into words\nhelped me realize some things.
So mine is about "not letting up\nmy dash during direct play"?
I mean, he's right. You specialize in speed,\nbut you always slow down when you meet\nup with the ball, cutting your momentum in half.
Yeah, I know, but fixing that's\neasier said than done.
If you give up just cuz it's\nhard, you'll never get better.
Yeah, you're right... Guess\nI've got no other choice then!
Hey, Ishizaki, do I really have\nthis bad habit it says here?
Now that he mentions it, yeah, you do that.
Huh...
Oh, I get it... So when I'm attacking\non this line I should keep in mind a\ncombo play from over there...?
We did all kinds of formations back in Toho\nAcademy, but I guess there's still a lot to learn.
Yeah, that's for sure...
(I hate to admit it, but I don't have nearly\nas much experience as him. All the more\nreason to absorb everything I can!) 
(Genzo and the others picked\nup on this much so quickly?)
Maybe we can't do all of these right away, but if\nwe can learn even one more formation, or overcome\none weakness, our team gets that much stronger.
So try to keep these in mind.
Thanks, Wakabayashi!
It's like, all the morning practice we've\ndone is starting to really take root.
What? More people are coming...?
Yo! We'll be joining you guys from here on out!
Heh heh, this really feels like\na training camp now, huh?
*yawn*
Still sleepy? You don't have to push yourself\nto come to morning practice, you know.
Nah, I can't sleep anyway with Jito snoring\nlike a walrus... Figured I might as well.
So you've got it rough too?
Alright, let's get this show on the road!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
Tak!
That feels like enough for today.
Are those the English players?
Are those the Uruguayan players?
Looks like they're heading back\nfrom morning practice, too.
Great minds think alike.
Think we could practice with them?
Let's get back to the dorms.
Wow, that's a great idea,\n<avatar_name>! You're a genius!
Good idea. I mean we have this automatic\ntranslator, so it's kind of a waste not to use it.
But would it be bad if we just\ninvited them on our own?
Yeah, maybe we should run this by the coach first.
Then let's go ask him!
I see. I get where you're coming from.
True, you rarely get the chance to practice\nwith players from other countries.
I'll look into it and talk to the other coach.
Thank you, sir!
Then, we'll be heading back to the dorms!
(But still, that's such an unheard of idea.)
(I suppose that's another advantage of youth.)
Yeah, let's go.
...
What's the matter?
No, it’s nothing...
(Practicing with foreign players\ncould be a great experience.)
(But I guess it would be bad if they\nlearned all our signals and stuff.)
Alright boys, let's start practice!\nFirst up is ten laps around the field!
Roger that, Coach!
Roger that, Coach!
Roger that, Coach!
Roger that, Coach!
Roger that, Coach!
Roger that, Coach!
Here we gooo!
Ha! You talk big, but I betcha\nyou'll be the first to wear out!
What was that?!
Long distance running is my specialty!
Like I'd lose to you!
Those two sure are energetic.
I mean, everyone's hyped up about the training.
That's for sure. I guess we\njust love getting better.
Yeah, I need to train even\nharder, if I want to be a pro!
I won't be beaten by you either, Ishizaki!
(Training is pointless, I'll just\nput in the minimum effort.)
What's gotten into you, <avatar_name>?\nYou seem extra charged today!
We're not going to be outdone\nby a corner-cutter like you!
N-Not bad, <avatar_name>...
Y-You've got some stamina.
Actually, you look different today. Like,\nyou got a different look in your eyes.
Seriously. Did something happen? You've\nnever seemed this motivated before.
I've been thinking about my future.
I'm aiming for the World Cup!
Your future, huh?
I think that's a great attitude! Keep pushing\nyourself, and the rest of us'll try and keep up!
Now you're sounding like Tsubasa.
What's wrong with that? I'd love\nto play in the World Cup, too.
Whatever, dreams are cheap.
What?! Just watch me! I'm definitely going to now!
(I always knew you'd figure out\nwhat matters, <avatar_name>.)
(And that's why I put my hopes in you,\n<avatar_name>.)
(So you finally realized it,\n<avatar_name>?)
Hey, what's with that pace,\n<avatar_name>? You're gonna\nbe last, you know! Where's your drive?!
Just forget about him. If we slow down to\nmatch his pace, it'll just hurt our training, too.
Y-Yeah...
(Did I go wrong somewhere as your mentor,\n<avatar_name>...?)
(I'm disappointed, <avatar_name>...)
(And I was supposed to be his mentor... I failed.)
(At this point, nothing I say would\nget through to him, would it?)
Hey, I hear we're getting a new goalie soon.
Oh yeah, I heard that, too.\nThat's the "Illusionary Goalie" right?
Man, physical rehab is seriously the\nworst. I just wanna quit already.
Ha! Like I'd believe that when\nyou're giving it your all every day.
Well, yeah. If I don't take this seriously,\nI'd be betraying soccer. I'd never do that.
...
Where's Schneider?
He headed to the gym, said he\nwanted to try out the latest machine.
(Then now's my chance...)
Actually, Kaltz, can I ask you a question?
Sure, what it is?
You've been friends with Schneider\nsince you were kids, right?
Yeah, why?
Then do you know what his father's up to now?
...
I heard his old man left home\nand works in a harbor.
At a harbor?
Schneider never talks about it though.\nEveryone's got their own baggage, y'know?
Does this have anything to do with Schmidt?
Well, something like that.
Who's Schmidt?
A player from Hamburg's top team.
Oh right! I used to hear his name a lot.
A while back when Hamburg was in a slump,\nthe coach got ill and Schneider's dad took over.
So back then Schmidt was sort of the ace, but the\nnew coach took him off the starting line-up.
The two of them had never gotten along anyway,\nso Schmidt left the team. It was a huge deal.
But if you're talking results, it was also a huge\nmistake. It was the worst season the team ever\nhad.
So the old coach came back,\nand Schneider's dad was fired.
Not only that, the other team Schmidt had joined\nwent on to take third place. And as far as the\nteam was concerned, good ol' dad was a villain.
So he got depressed, and let's just say Schneider\ndoesn't like to talk about his family life so much\nanymore.
Schneider was getting blamed for his dad's\ndecision too, so that must've been rough.
I see...
But it's not like Schmidt is\nanything special anymore, is it?
Yeah, all he ever does is repeat\nthis one aggressive play pattern.
Once the other teams got used\nto it, he was easy to deal with.
Plus he gets fatigued mid-season,\nand his movement gets way worse.
I mean, that's what Schneider's dad was saying\nwhen he took him off the starting line-up.
So in the end, he was right?
Well, I guess...
(I see, so in order to clear his father's name...)
...
Gah!
It's so close, but... What am I missing?!
Hey, Tsubasa.
What're you doing here?
I was working on some footwork. I heard what was\nup from Kojiro, so I wanted to come see how you\nwere doing.
Looks like you're struggling a bit.
Well, you're not wrong...
It feels like it's almost clicking, but...
Sheesh, why do you always gotta be like\nthis? If you're having trouble, just talk to us.
But this is a problem with MY skill.
You can do it, man.
Why do you push yourself so hard?
Is it really just trying to nail that technique?
Thanks for the encouragement.
What do you mean "why"? I guess... I want to win.
I mean, we're aiming to be the world's best.\nI need to push myself or I won't get better.
Care to elaborate?
...
Well, this an old story, but...
The day me and you and Roberto first met,\nhe showed us an overhead kick, remember?
Yeah, I do now that you mention it.
And then you started practicing it right away.\nAll the way until sunset. And you did it.
I guess you've been this\nway... since the beginning.
I just thought it was so cool... And I wanted\nnothing more than to be able to do it, too!
Yeah, I remember much fun you had figuring it out.
But now it's different. You\nlook like you're suffering.
Huh?
Yeah, I think so too. It looks to me like you're\nfocused on winning, instead of having fun.
Not that that's a bad thing, but...\nIt's not like you, Tsubasa.
Maybe... You're right.
I want the team to win, I want to be the best in\nthe world, and I want to go pro. Lately I've only\nbeen thinking about stuff like that.
So I lost sight of what was most important...
Tsubasa...
I love soccer. It's fun. That's why\nI started playing in the first place.
...
Alright! I can do this!
This is my Drive Shot.
Spread your wings in the American skies!
Łoł!
You could have easily won today's match had you\nstuck to the strategy we discussed beforehand.
But apparently you fools wanted to\n"play your own soccer" and rejected my\nplan. Leading to THIS disgraceful defeat.
Yes, the reason you lost wasn't because\nyou're all substitute players, it was\nbecause you disobeyed my instructions.
Even you talentless hacks\nshould understand that, yes?
...
But I'm willing to let this slide.\nBoth this loss and your mutiny.
After all, this was all to be expected.
...?
I'd imagine you're wondering why I\nsent out you subs for today's match.
It was all to bring your rebellious\nnatures into the light of day.
Wha--!
I'm the only one who knows how to make this team\nwin, so if we want that to happen, you all need to\nfollow my orders.
In other words... I have no use for some\npunk kids that aren't going to listen.
...
But what a shame. If only you'd had a change\nof heart and followed my directions.
I might have been willing to let you play in\nfuture matches. But this was your last chance.
So you're saying we're switching up\nthe starting members next match?
Of course.
But since we lost today's match, won't we be up\nagainst Germany? Are we going to be alright?
My oh my, don't tell me we have\nanother doubter in our midst?
Take it however you like. But it's\nnot like you can win without me.
I have ways, but... Well, I'll leave it at that.
It doesn't matter who our opponent is.
Because I'll be playing in the next match.
Seriously?!
There are people in this tournament I wish to\nface. And they're definitely making it to the\nfinals. So we need to make it too.
But this wasn't in the plan.\nHave you told Cardinal?
Of course. I received his\npermission. He understands.
So none of you need to worry.\nJust do exactly as I say.
